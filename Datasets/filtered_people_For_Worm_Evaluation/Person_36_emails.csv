When I tried to log in to CORP I got an error that no domain  server was able to validate my password.  I went in and released the IP but  got an error when trying to renew.  I verified that the card was installed  correctly and that network properties were correct.  I then plugged straight  into DSL and bypassed the Nortel box thinking that I could at least get that  to work and then VPN into Enron.  That also did not work.  I spoke to SWB  tech support for almost an hour trying some various things but was  unsuccessful in those as well.  I also spoke to Mark Scott via telephone.  I was unable to ping the gateway...nor anything for that matter which led me  to believe that there was something wrong with the line.  SWB said they were  going to do some line testing from their end and would get back with Mike.   At this point I would recommend sending someone out from Mark Scott's team  that is more familiar with these setups than I am.  I do think it would be a  good idea from someone from TSG to accompany them if they are able to arrange  a time and then disseminate that information to the rest of the team.

This will allow us to  trade the ""non-standard"" volumes with all of the market.  Do we have a creative team that might be able to assist us in our efforts?

This includes the monthly basis, daily basis, and gd index for SJ,  ROX, Scal, CG, and Malin.   They will make certain that the gd index products  are out there for all terms.  Cary Metz is managing the Perm products.  I will handle the prompt month physical fixed price and index for all of the  index points.  The term physical index will be coming soon.  The rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the  next day trading, while adding the BOM physical with a basis link to  Monique's GD BOM products.

"Hey guys.  Let's try this.  Take the data from 2000 and change the  following.  Take Keystone West volumes to 850,000/d rateably, then add the  new gen numbers posted below.  You will need to add this demand to the EOC S  ML demand numbers (Is Salmayuca included in this number?).  We should use the  2000 waha west volumes for now.  You should end up with reduced ehrenberg  volumes for the reduction in Keystone west volumes and the addition of New  Gen demand.  Run the storage balance at 2000 Socal in this scenario.  We will  then plug forward with waha west volumes to balance Socal in 2001.  Also, add  columns to adjust (90%, 60%, 50%, etc) the burns for new gen in SW.  We  should then look to adjusting socal demand down for the high hydro/increased  NW imports to CA scenario that could happen.  Use the SP-15 2000 gen numbers  and then back out the avg of 1999 and 2000 power imports.  I would like to  avoid averaging 1999 and 2000 socal gas demand. Use a 10,000 heat rate to  reduce gas demand.  Have Jay adjust EOC demand for normal weather.  We may  have to refer to the load sensitivity data from west power to reduce the SW  electric loads and then back out of gen numbers using a 10,000 heat rate.  We  will then be exposed to EPNG and the OPS increasing Keystone west volumes  between now and next summer - run the 2001 with this possibility as well.   Take Key West to 1.1 bcf.

"We will need to discuss how to adjust physical risk to match the flow  constraints on EPNG.  The currrent capacity cuts in the SJ and Socal topock  delivery points are 50%.

"Good morning.  With the energy crisis in California at this time, we will  need to be extra careful with nominations at Socal and throughout the west to  ensure that we continue to provide the excellent nomination service that we  have been providing to our customers.  You guys are doing an excellent job  and we understand that you are under quite a bit of pressure with limited  staff.  Our contracts state that we must notify every customer of  pipeline  allocations 12 hours in advance.  We all know that this can be almost  impossible on EPNG, but because of the current price levels at Socal and the  basins, Enron needs to call each customer and notify them of their cuts with  an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential  penalties.  We also need to document when the call was made.  In regards to  the ATM nominations on Socal (ones that we can't monitor), Enron will be  requesting full pipeline summaries of the nominations from our  counterparties.  Please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take  place at these historical levels.  We need to remember that our  counterparties may not act as they have in the past due to the market price  implications on their P&L.  We should not rely on prior business conduct in  regards to ""standard epng allocations"" when dealing with our customers.  I  would expect that the market is going to overreact to any cuts that may be  above the ""pipeline average"".  Let's discuss how we are going to monitor the flows of nominations out of our  control.  How do we prevent collusion with respect to the socal nominations  that we can't see?  Are there package numbers on each baseload contract to  ensure that they don't simply reshuffle gas according to price? Let me know  which companies are not providing Enron with timely allocation reports at  Socal and I will call their senior trader to discuss getting this operational  information sooner.

I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have  several people who have not left before 10:30 this week.  2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on  Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading  floor until after 5:00 p.m. 3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and  benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here  late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One  suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my  understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

"Dear Jeff,  I am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and  identifying any problems (i.e. penalty language, notification deadlines for  OFOs, etc.) that may need to be addressed.  We have experienced a few  problems with SW Gas Corp. recently.  They have been penalizing Enron for  cuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month  deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an  interruptible contract and cannot be penalized.  This was news to me.  Can  you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact  business with our customers in the west?  I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west  desk for some time.

"Dear John,  I had a meeting with Phillip after our morning discussion about P&L and it  seems that there may be some issues regarding how I run my book.  It was my  mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked  properly.  The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners  and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the  options were not in my position.  Also, the tolls curves are not treated as  schedule C.  I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift  as needed.  My P&L did not match the Socal position because of physical index  curveshift and an adjustment to transport.    The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him  concerns me.  I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and  financial trading book within Enron.   I will stand on the fact that no one  within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than  I.  The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen  at Enron since I have been here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go  to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.    I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it  is responsible for communicating with you directly.  Let's get together and  discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.   It  may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until  this point.

Gray Davis' energy speech The Associated Press      , , -- (04-05) 18:08 PDT Here is the text of Gov. Gray Davis' televised speech on energy Thursday, as prepared for delivery:    ""Good evening. I'm speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing California: our energy crisis.    ""Simply stated, we have two problems: supply is too low and costs are too high. Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996. But no matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to solve problems. And that's what I'm doing.    ""The only long-term solution is to build more power plants. We must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities. But prices won't fall and supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume.    ""Yet in the 12 years before I took office, not a single major power plant was built in California. Not one. Since I became governor, we've licensed 12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And we're doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water.    ""Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies. The generators are free to charge whatever they want because they're governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices.    ""This past winter, the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof, driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy.    ""In January, with the feds still refusing to do their job, California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep the power on and the economy strong. That's not all:    -- We also negotiated long-term contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices.    -- I used my emergency powers to seize control of low-cost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators.    -- We began negotiations to buy the utilities' transmission system.    -- We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants.    -- We're launching an $800 million conservation program.    -- We're moving to establish a public power authority to build more power. If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs, we'll build them ourselves.    -- And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us off, we're using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct.    ""We can't fix 12 years of inaction overnight. But we're making real progress.    ""Now, as you know, I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates. It's become increasingly clear, however, that with rising natural gas prices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack of supply, that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong.    ""But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive rate hikes. So I'm urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers, reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back.

Gray Davis' energy speech The Associated Press      , , -- (04-05) 18:08 PDT Here is the text of Gov. Gray Davis' televised speech on energy Thursday, as prepared for delivery:    ""Good evening. I'm speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing California: our energy crisis.    ""Simply stated, we have two problems: supply is too low and costs are too high. Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996. But no matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to solve problems. And that's what I'm doing.    ""The only long-term solution is to build more power plants. We must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities. But prices won't fall and supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume.    ""Yet in the 12 years before I took office, not a single major power plant was built in California. Not one. Since I became governor, we've licensed 12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And we're doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water.    ""Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies. The generators are free to charge whatever they want because they're governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices.    ""This past winter, the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof, driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy.    ""In January, with the feds still refusing to do their job, California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep the power on and the economy strong. That's not all:    -- We also negotiated long-term contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices.    -- I used my emergency powers to seize control of low-cost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators.    -- We began negotiations to buy the utilities' transmission system.    -- We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants.    -- We're launching an $800 million conservation program.    -- We're moving to establish a public power authority to build more power. If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs, we'll build them ourselves.    -- And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us off, we're using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct.    ""We can't fix 12 years of inaction overnight. But we're making real progress.    ""Now, as you know, I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates. It's become increasingly clear, however, that with rising natural gas prices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack of supply, that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong.    ""But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive rate hikes. So I'm urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers, reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back.    ""Under my proposal, more than half of you won't pay a penny more. For the rest, the average increase will be 26 1/2 percent. For many of that group, rates will rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest users will see their rates rise 34 1/2 percent on average. That includes business paying their share.

From:  Stephen Swain                           04/10/2001 11:58 AM    To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt  Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris  Mallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill Williams  III/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: CAISO demand reduction  Phillip et al.,  I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in  the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.  March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand  over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for  temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates  into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as  compared with the previous year.  Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary  reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other  forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making  total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.   This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple  more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the  retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it  is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last  year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in  Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation  are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of  meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general  economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least  make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.  Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area  only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC  (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO  portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in  demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As  you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum  smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at  least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its  wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several  mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are  sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly  how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.   Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's  economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of  the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I  think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already  realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the  non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the  WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around  6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.  I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you  with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I  hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any  questions or need any further information.

Overall losses were limited due to gains in chip stocks. Both indexes are at important crossroads as they are challenging April's highs. Multiple closes above these resistance levels are needed to extend this spring's rallies. At the same time, momentum indicators are overbought warning bulls to use caution as short-term tops might be in or near.  The Dow closed lower on Monday but near mid-range. Light support came from drug and cyclical stocks. Gains in Caterpillar, Eastman Kodak and IBM also provided support for the Dow. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that a test of February's high crossing at 11,035.10 is still possible this month.  INTEREST RATES June bonds closed lower on Monday as they extended last Friday's loss. Expectations are running at 80-90% that the Fed will cut interest rates by another 50-basis-points at its May 15th FOMC meeting following last week's larger-than-expected unemployment report. Today's setback was no big surprise giving last Friday's poor close. Nevertheless, last week's breakout above this spring's downtrend line signals that a short-term bottom and trend change has taken place. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices near-term are possible. If June resumes last week's rally the 50% retracement level crossing at 103-20 is a potential target.  The CRB INDEX closed lower on Monday due to weakness in grains, bellies and energies. Today's decline turned a number of momentum indicators including stochastics bearish warning traders that last week's high might have marked a double top with April's high. Closes below 212.64 would open the door for a larger- degree decline during May.  ENERGY MARKETS closed lower on Monday due to profit taking that was triggered by comments made by President Bush who indicated his concerns over high retail energy prices. Additional pressure came from expectations that this week's API data will once again show stocks rose last week. Retail gasoline prices are running at record highs, eclipsing last June's levels amid a series of disruptions at refineries that feed the gas-hungry U.S. market.  June crude oil closed lower on Monday and in doing so turned a number of short-term momentum indicators neutral to bearish. Closes below last week's low crossing at 27.37 would confirm that the short-term trend has turned down. I would not be surprised to see a steady to higher close on Tuesday due to light short covering. Resistance begins at 29.40 then February's high crossing at 30.13.  June heating oil closed sharply lower on Monday but remains within last week's trading range. Closes above 77.80 or below 73.10 are needed to confirm a breakout of a two-week trading range and clear up near-term direction in the market. Momentum indicators are neutral to bearish hinting that sideways to lower prices near-term are possible.  June unleaded gas posted a key reversal down on Monday due to profit taking after falling short of testing weekly resistance crossing at 109.60. Additional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. However, it will take closes below trendline support crossing near 103-25 before a top and trend change can be confirmed. The weekly ADX (a trend-following indicator) remains in a bullish trend mode signaling that we could see additional gains this spring.  June Henry Hub natural gas plunged below key weekly support crossing at 4.38 on Monday due to expectations that this week's AGA inventory data will continue to show natural gas supplies building. Today's plunge below key support crossing at 4.38 has opened the door for additional weakness and a possible test of the 75% retracement level of the 1999/2000 rally crossing at 3.625 later this spring. The rising ADX signals that additional weakness during May is possible.  CURRENCIES The June Dollar closed higher on Monday and above April's uptrend line crossing near 115.27. Additional gains on Tuesday would increase the odds that last week's correction has come to an end. Momentum indicators are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices near-term are possible.  The June Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on Monday as they extended last week's narrow trading ranges. Closes above April's high or low are needed to clear up near-term direction in both markets. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices near-term are possible.  The June Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower and below April's uptrend line on Monday thereby confirming last Friday's key reversal down and trendline breakout. With this spring's rally stalling out near the 50% retracement level of this year's decline and Monday's trendline breakout, the door is open for sideways to lower prices during May. Momentum indicators have also turned bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible. I would not be surprised to see a lower opening on Tuesday but would not rule out a short covering bounce.  The June Japanese Yen closed higher due to a late- session rally as the market continues to challenge the upper boundary of this spring's trading range crossing at .8327. Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to confirm a breakout and trend change. Momentum indicators are bullish hinting that additional gains are possible.  PRECIOUS METALS June gold closed steady on Monday as it remains above April's uptrend line but below the long-term downtrend line crossing near 269. Momentum indicators have become overbought warning traders that June gold is at an important crossroads. Closes above or below the aforementioned support/resistance levels are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.  July silver posted an inside day with a lower close as the market fell short of testing the lower boundary of this spring's trading range crossing at 4.31. Closes below 4.31 are needed to confirm a trading range breakout and trend change. Momentum indicators are bearish but nearing their respective overbought zones hinting that this spring's trading range may remain intact for the time being.  July copper posted an inside day with a higher close due to light short covering as it consolidated some of last Thursday and Friday's losses. Closes below last Friday's low crossing at 78.00 would turn a number of short-term momentum indicators bearish thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top was posted last week.  GRAINS July corn posted a key reversal down on Monday as forecasts for increased precip across the dry eastern Corn Belt and a quiet export market weighed on prices. Trading is likely to remain subdued ahead of Thursday's supply/demand report. This afternoon's planting progress report showed that 58% of the U.S. corn crop is planted compared with 74% a year ago and 52% for the five-year average. This will likely add to the selling pressure on Tuesday, as planting delay fears will have been reduced. July's inability to close above broken support crossing at 2.11 underscores the weak tone surrounding the corn market at this point in time.  July wheat closed sharply lower on Monday following widespread rains that fell across portions of the Plains over the weekend. Today's breakout below trendline support crossing near 2.71 fell short of testing March's low of 2.65 1/2. Closes below this support level would renew the long-term downtrend while setting the stage for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.50 later this summer. I would not be surprised to see a steady to higher close on Tuesday due to short covering following today's late- session bounce. Today's planting progress report showed that 35% of the spring wheat is planted compared with the five-year average of 50%. The crop conditions report for winter wheat showed that 26% is rated poor to very poor, 33% is fair and 41% is rated good to excellent.  SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed lower on Monday due to increased chances for rain across the eastern Soybean Belt this week. July soybeans continue to hold above broken trendline resistance as they extended last week's trading range. However, upside potential appears limited in the face of slowing export sales, burdensome carryout levels and increased U.S. planted acreage this year. If the rally off the late-April low resumes, this spring's high at 4.49 3/4 is July's next target. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their respective overbought zones hinting that a short-term top might be in or near.  July soybean meal closed lower on Monday due to light profit taking and spillover selling from soybeans and wheat. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways to higher trading on Tuesday as last week's rally opened the door for a possible test of March's high crossing at 160.50 later this spring. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their respective overbought zones warning bulls to use caution.  LIVESTOCK June hogs posted a potential downside reversal on Monday but held above the 2000-01 uptrend line crossing near 66.75. Multiple closes below this support level would confirm a trendline breakout while opening the door for a larger-degree decline this spring. Weekly momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.  June cattle closed higher on Monday as it extended last Friday's late-session short covering bounce. Signs of rising boxed-beef prices triggered today's rally. However, gains were limited by expectations for steady to $1.00 lower cash bids this week. Momentum indicators are oversold and diverging following last week's test of January's low. I would not be surprised to see additional short covering during the first half of this week.  FOOD & FIBER July coffee resumed this spring's short covering rally as traders continue to build in a modest weather premium as winter approaches in Brazil. If this month's rally continues, March's high at 71.70 is July's next target. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that additional short-term gains are possible this week.  July cocoa closed modestly higher in narrow trading as it continues to consolidate above this spring's lows crossing at 955. Closes above 1034 or below 955 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.  July sugar closed lower on Monday due to profit taking hinting that the market might have priced in all of the bullish export news from Asia at this point in time. Momentum indicators are very overbought and turning neutral to bearish hinting that a short-term top is in or near. If the decline off last week's high continues, trendline support crossing near 885 is July's next target. Closes below this support level would confirm a short-term top has been posted. If the rally continues, this year's high crossing at 941 is July's next target.  July cotton closed slightly higher on Monday as it consolidates near the bottom of this spring's trading range. Trading is likely to remain subdued ahead of this week's supply/demand report. Favorable moisture conditions across west Texas and the Delta along with burdensome carryout levels continues to limit gains in both old and new-crop cotton.

June Nasdaq prices are still within striking distance of the April high of 1995. Sideways trading the past week has negated a fledgling four-week-old uptrend on the daily bar chart. Bulls still have some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is resistance at the key 2,000 area. First support is seen at the 1,732 area. June S&P 500 futures closed firmer today. Prices have leveled off the past week, after rallying solidly off the early-April low. Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285 resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00. First support is seen at 1206.00.  LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed 2 cents higher at 71.12. Prices closed at the session low and managed to fill an upside gap on the daily bar chart that was created in early trading. The market saw another upside corrective bounce earlier today, after punching to a fresh 6.5-month low last Friday. The bears are in control of the market. Prices are still trading below an accelerating two-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart. The market is still a bit short-term oversold, and I would not be surprised to see more of an upside correction this week. Next support, basis June, is seen at $71.00. First resistance now comes in at the $72.00 level.  August feeder cattle closed up 3 cents today at $88.25. Prices closed at the session low today. Range-bound trade continues. As this market neared the bottom end of the recent trading range, which is around $87.50, the market again took an upside bias. Look for more choppy trading between $89 and $87.50. If prices can break out of that aforementioned range, the direction of the breakout will likely be the direction of the next significant trend. Next resistance is seen at $88.70-- today's high. First support is seen at $88.00.  June lean hogs closed $0.15 higher today, at $67.50. Prices are still showing consolidation at lower levels, after the sell off last week. Hogs are still a bit overdone on the downside, on a short-term basis, so some more corrective upside consolidation would not surprise me. Still, the bears have the strong momentum on their side at present. Next support lies at $66.25. First resistance is located at the 68.15 level--today's high.  GRAINS: July corn futures closed off 3 cents at $2.05 today. Crop progress reports out Monday evening showing very good planting progress in the U.S. weighed on the corn market today. There is just not much bullish fundamental news in the corn market right now. The weak wheat market is also weighing on corn. On Monday, respected Iowa State University Climatologist Elwynn Taylor predicted record yields for the Corn Belt this year. It would not surprise me to see the commodity funds make another significant downside assault on the corn and bean markets in the near term. Next support is now seen at $2.00. Next resistance is seen at the $2.07 1/2 level--today's high.  July soybeans closed 2 3/4 cents higher at $4.40 1/2 today. Prices are consolidating the recent gains, but bulls still by no means have any significant momentum. Fundamentally, there is not much in the way of good news for bulls right now. I would not be surprised to see the commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term. This market is still in technical trouble and it's going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force prices solidly higher. First resistance is seen at the $4.45 area and then $4.50. First support is seen at $4.35 and then at $4.30.  July soybean meal closed off $1.10 at $155.70 today. Prices this week are showing a corrective pullback after they pushed to a fresh eight-week high last Friday. Recent price action is still encouraging to the bulls and is a sign the lows are in place in the meal market. Next resistance comes in at the $158.50 area. First support is seen at $154.00.  July bean oil closed 22 points higher at 15.09 cents today. Prices saw a corrective bounce today after dropping to a new contract low of 14.76 cents on Monday. This market is technically much weaker than beans or meal, and is still a bit overdone on the downside, on a short-term basis. I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil. Next resistance comes in at 15.25 cents. Next support is seen at the contract low of 14.76 cents.  July Chicago wheat closed 2 1/2 cents lower at $2.66 3/4 today. Prices poked to a new contract low of $2.65. More rain in the Plains has cast a bearish pall over the market. With the wheat crop behind schedule anyway, the recent rains could allow the crop to make some good improvement. Bears are in full command. Just last week, prices pushed to a fresh six-week high. Serious technical damage has occurred the past few sessions. First support lies at the contract low of $2.65. Next resistance is seen at $2.70. This market is short-term oversold and I suspect we'll see a corrective bounce soon.  SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 18 points higher at 9.10 cents today. We could see a bull flag starting to form in sugar, on the daily bar chart. This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains. A three-month high was scored in July sugar late last week. The bulls have good momentum and a steep and accelerating five-week-old uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now comes in at 9.25 cents. First support is now seen at 8.80 cents.  July N.Y. coffee closed 15 points higher at 68.90 cents today. Prices pushed to another fresh two-month high today as the bulls continue to gain momentum. This recent move is the most significant showing by the bulls since mid-January. The fact that prices have not sold off sharply the past three sessions is encouraging for the bulls, too--given recent price history. Still, the bears could be setting a trap, like they did in early January. If bulls can push prices above 70 cents and then see follow-through strength, bears will begin to think this uptrend is sustainable. First resistance comes in at 70 cents. First support is seen 65.00 cents.  July N.Y. cocoa closed $55 higher today, at $1,044. Today's strong gap-higher trade on the daily bar chart put the bulls back on a level playing field with the bears in a hurry. Prices pushed above and negated a 2.5-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart. Next resistance comes in at $1,050 and then $1,060. First support is now seen at today's low of $1,001.  July cotton closed 99 points lower at 45.44 cents today. Cotton is in a strong bear market, and a new contract low was scored just today, at 45.40 cents. Right now, any rebounds are likely to be just selling opportunities for the bears. But, my bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process. Next support lies at 45.00 cents. First resistance is seen around 48.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers should beware. Bulls need to watch for some ""basing"" action, which may be beginning.  July orange juice futures closed 45 points lower today, at 76.95 cents. Prices late last week probed into an important gap area on the daily bar chart, which begins at 77.85 cents, but did not fill that gap on the upside. Bears rule and the market is still technically weak. However, if the aforementioned gap can be filled on the upside, that's an important first step for the bulls in turning the market around. That gap will be filled if prices move above 78.55 cents, which is first resistance. Next support comes in at 76.00 cents.  July lumber futures closed $2.60 lower at $308.40 today. Prices just Monday hit yet a new for-the-move high, at $313.20, as the bull market roars on. Today's price action is just some healthy consolidation in a bull market. Expect more volatility, however, as is typical for this market. The next upside objective for the bulls is the $315.00 area. First support is seen at the $300.00 area. This market is still short-term overbought, technically, and I would not be surprised to see a decent downside correction soon.  METALS: June COMEX gold closed down $1.00 today, at $265.50. Prices late last week pushed to a new seven-week high. Despite recent choppy trading, this market is still trending up from its early-April low. But bulls need to see some solid upside movement soon to keep what momentum they have recently gained. But the fact that prices have not sold way off after the rally is encouraging to the bulls. Next resistance is located at $268. First support is seen at $264.00.  July silver closed up $0.008 today, at $4.335 an ounce. Prices are not that far above the contract low. Still, prices are chopping at lower levels. This suggests a ""basing"" action that many markets need to change the trend from down, to sideways, to eventually up. Next support is seen at $4.30. First resistance is seen at $4.41. Bears still have the advantage.  July N.Y. copper closed 1.80 cents lower today, at 76.85 cents. Stock market weakness helped drive this market lower today. Prices are still attempting to build a base and recover from the early-April low. My bias is still that the downside is limited for copper. The stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper, however. Next resistance is seen at 78.00 cents. Next support is seen at 76.00 cents.  ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.19 lower at $28.35 today. Bulls and bears are at a stand-off and will duke it out over the near term. Expect more choppy trading. Next support is seen at 28.00. Next resistance lies at $29.50.  July heating oil closed 30 points higher today, at .7551. Bulls still have the slight edge, but look for more choppy trading in the near future. Next support is seen at 73.00 cents. Next resistance is seen at 77.50 cents.  July unleaded gasoline closed 128 points lower at .9898 today. Prices scored a new contract high just Monday, and saw follow-through selling today. That confirms a key reversal in this market. But given the recent volatility in unleaded, I am not placing a lot of emphasis on this key reversal. Bulls are still in command as peak driving season nears. Top-pickers beware! Next resistance is seen at $1.03. First support is seen at $.9600.  July natural gas closed 3.6 cents higher at $4.35 today. Today was just an upside correction in a steep downtrend. Prices hit a fresh five-and-one-half-month low Monday. Next support is seen at $4.25 and first resistance is now at $4.50. This market is still short-term oversold, technically.  FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 62 points lower at .8828 today. Bears have the decided edge again as bulls have lost all the momentum they had gained in mid-April. My bias is still that there is not much downside left in the Euro. Look for more choppy action in the near term. Bulls will again gain good momentum if they can push prices above the .9075 area. Next support is now seen at .8800. Next resistance is seen at .9000.  The June Japanese yen closed 5 points lower at .8279 today. Prices pushed to a fresh six-week high last Friday, but bears are still in control. Bulls are hoping for some ""basing"" activity at lower levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell. Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at the .8326 level.  The June Swiss franc closed 36 points lower today, at .5739. Bears are in command. Still, my bias is that prices won't deteriorate much more. Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at the .5830 level.  The June Australian dollar futures closed 37 points lower at .5150 today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month high late last week and are consolidating a bit this week. The bulls still have the advantage as a five-week-old uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart. My bias is that the lows are in place. First resistance is now seen at .5250. First support is now seen at .5100.  The June Canadian dollar closed 14 points lower today, at .6464. Prices sold off some more today after the key reversal down on the daily bar chart that was scored Monday. Bulls had good momentum, but have lost some the past two sessions. The key reversal does not indicate prices are headed back toward the lows seen a few weeks ago. What it does suggest is a decent downside correction to the recent gains will occur over the near term. This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6548 level. First support is seen at the .6450 level.  The June British pound closed 126 points lower at 1.4244. Trading continues choppy at lower levels. This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling. One could argue that price action the past few weeks has been a ""basing"" before prices eventually turn north. A move above the 1.4500 level would be considered a bullish ""upside breakout"" from the recent congestion area. Next support is now seen at the 1.4200 level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4400 level.  The June U.S. dollar index closed 75 points higher at 116.24 today. Bulls are regaining momentum. The recent double-top reversal on the daily bar chart still favors the bears longer-term. Next resistance lies at the 116.50 level. First support is seen at the 114.50 area. My bias is still that a near-term top is in place in the dollar index.  June U.S. T-bonds closed 17/32 lower today at 101 21/32. Prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar chart today, whereby the high was higher and the low was lower than the previous session's trading range, with a lower close. Bulls need to show some resolve soon, after pushing prices well off the lows scored in late April. A steep six-week-old downtrend line was penetrated on the upside last week and negated.

Prices are basically trading sideways. The Nasdaq June futures are still within striking distance of the April high of 1995. Sideways trading the past week has negated a fledgling four-week-old uptrend on the daily bar chart. Bulls still have some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is resistance at the key 2,000 area. First support is seen at the 1,732 area. June S&P 500 futures closed lower. Prices have also leveled off the past week, after rallying solidly off the early-April low. Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285 resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00. First support is seen at 1206.00.  LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed $1.17 lower at 70.00 today. Ouch! Prices gapped sharply lower on the daily bar chart and hit a fresh eight-month low today. Reports that cash cattle traded $1.00 lower today at some locations sent the futures market tumbling. Today's plummet leaves the June futures well overextended, technically, on a short-term basis. A corrective bounce is in order. The bears are in full control of the market. Prices are trading way below an accelerating two-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart. Next support, basis June, is seen at $69.00. First resistance now comes in at the $70.50 level.  August feeder cattle were pressured by the fat cattle futures and closed off 75 cents today at $87.50. Prices closed near the session low today and are now down in the lower portion of the recent trading range. If recent history continues to play out, the market will bounce up from the losses of the past two days. But if prices break down below the bottom of the recent trading range, which is right at today's low of $87.40, then the door is opened to a lower trend down to the January low just above the $86.00 level. Next resistance is seen at $87.80. First support is seen at $87.25.  June lean hogs closed $0.58 lower today, at $66.92. Prices are still showing consolidation at lower levels, after the sell off last week. Firmer cash hog trade today could not stave off the technical weakness this market is experiencing. The bears have the strong momentum on their side at present. Next support lies at $66.25. First resistance is located at the 68.15 level.  GRAINS: July corn futures closed unchanged at $2.05 today. It was a quiet ""inside day"" on the daily bar chart today, ahead of Thursday's USDA supply and demand report and the weekly export sales figures. Prices are under pressure this week after weekly crop progress reports out Monday showed very good planting progress in the U.S. There is just not much bullish fundamental news in the corn market right now. It would not surprise me to see the commodity funds make another significant downside assault on the corn and bean markets in the near term. Next support is now seen at $2.00. Next resistance is seen at the $2.07 1/2.  July soybeans closed 1 1/2 cents lower at $4.39 today. Prices are consolidating the recent gains, but bulls by no means have any significant momentum. Still, it does look like a minor bull flag could be forming on the daily bar chart. Fundamentally, there is not much in the way of good news for bulls right now. Thursday's morning's USDA supply and demand report is expected to paint a picture that is not bullish for beans. I would not be surprised to see the commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term. This market is still in technical trouble and it's going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force prices solidly higher. First resistance is seen at the $4.45 area and then $4.50. First support is seen at $4.35 and then at $4.30. Several weeks ago, I purchased a July soybean call option with a strike price of $4.80, for a price of 8 1/4 cents ($412.50). That option last traded at 4 1/2 cents.  July soybean meal closed up $0.60 at $153.60 today. Prices this week are showing consolidation after they pushed to a fresh eight-week high last Friday. Recent price action is encouraging to the bulls and is a sign the lows are in place in the meal market. Let's see what tomorrow morning's export sales report shows. Next resistance comes in at the $158.50 area. First support is seen at $154.00.  July bean oil closed 26 points lower at 14.83 cents today. After prices saw a decent corrective bounce Tuesday, they sold right back off today. This increase in volatility is consistent with a bottom process in a market. Oil is technically much weaker than beans or meal right now. But I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil. Next resistance comes in at 15.00 cents. Next support is seen at the contract low of 14.76 cents.  July Chicago wheat closed 1 cent lower at $2.65 3/4 today. Prices today touched the contract low of $2.65 that was scored yesterday. ""Rain in the Plains Makes Grain."" That's a bearish refrain. With the wheat crop behind schedule anyway, the recent rains could allow the crop to make some good improvement. Bears are in full command. Serious technical damage has occurred the past few sessions. First support lies at the contract low of $2.65. Next resistance is seen at $2.70. This market is short-term oversold and I suspect we'll see a corrective bounce soon.  K.C. July HRW wheat closed off 1 cent at $3.22 1/4 today. Again, rainfall in the Plains states has weighed on the market for several sessions. A V-Top reversal is playing out on the daily bar chart. Serious chart damage has been inflicted the past few sessions. For bulls to get back in the ballgame, they need to push prices north and fill the downside gap on the daily bar chart (created last week) by pushing prices to the $3.34 area. That's a tall order right now. Next resistance is seen at the $3.28 area. Next support is seen at $3.20. This market is also short-term overdone on the downside.  SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 10 points lower at 9.00 cents today. We still could see a bull flag starting to form in sugar, on the daily bar chart. This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains. A three-month high was scored in July sugar late last week. The bulls have good momentum and a steep and accelerating five-week-old uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now comes in at 9.25 cents. First support is now seen at 8.80 cents.  July N.Y. coffee closed 100 points (1 cent) lower at 67.90 cents today. Prices closed near the session low. Still, prices today matched the two-month high set Tuesday, before backing off a bit. The bulls continue to gain momentum. This recent move is the most significant showing by the bulls since mid-January. The fact that prices have not sold off sharply the past few sessions is encouraging for the bulls, too--given recent price history. Still, the bears could be setting a trap, like they did in early January. If bulls can push prices above 70 cents and then see follow-through strength, bears will begin to think this uptrend is sustainable. First resistance comes in at 70 cents. First support is seen 65.00 cents.  July N.Y. cocoa closed $23 lower today, at $1,021. Prices pushed to a fresh six-week high today, before selling off by the close and closing near the session low. Tuesday's strong gap-higher trade on the daily bar chart did put the bulls back on a level playing field with the bears. Prices pushed above and negated a 2.5-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart. Next resistance comes in at $1,050--today's high. First support is now seen at $1,000.  July cotton closed 1 point lower at 45.43 cents today. Traders took a ""rest day"" today after Tuesday's solid losses, and ahead of Thursday's export sales and the monthly USDA supply and demand report. Cotton is in a strong bear market, and a new contract low was scored again today, at 45.36 cents. Right now, any rebounds are likely to be just selling opportunities for the bears. But, my bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process. Next support lies at 45.00 cents. First resistance is seen around 48.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers should beware. Bulls need to watch for some ""basing"" action, which may be beginning.  July orange juice futures closed 175 points higher today, at 78.70 cents. Prices closed near the session high today and filled an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart. That's an important first step for the bulls in turning this market around. Next resistance is seen at 79.00 cents. Next support comes in at 77.15 cents--today's low.  July lumber futures closed $6.90 lower at $301.50 today. Today's sell off is not unhealthy for the bulls. It was overdue. Prices just Monday hit yet a new for-the-move high, at $313.20. Today's price action is just some healthy consolidation in a bull market. Expect more volatility, however, as is typical for this market. The next upside objective for the bulls is the $315.00 area. First support is seen at the $300.00 area. This market is still a bit short-term overbought, technically, and I would not be surprised to more of a downside correction in the near term.  METALS: June COMEX gold closed up $4.90 today, at $270.40. Prices scored a big ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart today, and in the process pushed prices to a two-month high. Heavy fund short covering was featured in the trading pit. This market is in a nice uptrend since scoring its early-April low. Today's type of gain is just what bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart. Next resistance is located at $273. First support is seen at $265.00--today's low.  July silver closed up $0.08 today, at $4.415 an ounce. Prices popped on short covering and the rally in gold. Silver prices are still not that far above the contract low. Prices are chopping at lower levels, and this suggests a ""basing"" action that many markets need to change the trend from down, to sideways, to eventually up. Next support is seen at $4.33--today's low. First resistance is seen at $4.45. Bears still have the advantage.  July N.Y. copper closed 50 points lower today, at 76.35 cents. More stock market weakness helped drive this market lower again today. Prices may still be attempting to build a base and recover from the early-April low. My bias is still that the downside is limited for copper. But the stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper. Next resistance is seen at 77.00 cents. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents.  ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.53 higher at $28.90 today. Prices scored a mildly bullish ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart, but bulls and bears are still at a stand-off. Expect more choppy trading. Next support is seen at 28.00. Next resistance lies at $29.50.  July heating oil closed 149 points higher today, at .7700. Prices closed near the session high and bulls still have the slight edge. But look for more choppy trading in the near future. Next support is seen at 73.00 cents. Next resistance is seen at 77.50 cents and then 79.00 cents.  July unleaded gasoline closed 172 points higher at 1.0070 today. Prices closed near the session high and scored a bullish ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart. Prices scored a new contract high just Monday, but backed off sharply before the close and then saw follow-through selling Tuesday. That confirmed a key reversal. But given the recent volatility in unleaded, I am not placing a lot of emphasis on that key reversal. Bulls are still in command as peak driving season nears. Top-pickers beware! Next resistance is seen at $1.03. First support is seen at $.9780--today's low.  July natural gas closed 8.3 cents lower at $4.27 today. Prices hit a fresh five-and-one-half-month today. Next support is seen at $4.20 and first resistance is now at $4.50. This market is still short-term oversold, technically.  FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 10 points higher at .8842 today. Bears have the edge as bulls have lost all the momentum they had gained in mid-April. Prices hit a fresh three-week low today. My bias is still that there is not much downside left in the Euro. Look for more choppy action in the near term. Bulls will again gain good momentum if they can push prices above the .9075 area. Next support is now seen at .8800. Next resistance is seen at .9000.  The June Japanese yen closed 55 points lower at .8218 today. Bears are still in control. Bulls are hoping for some ""basing"" activity at lower levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell. Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at the .8326 level.  The June Swiss franc closed unchanged today, at .5745. Bears are in command. Still, my bias is that prices won't deteriorate much more. Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at the .5830 level.  The June Australian dollar futures closed 87 points higher at .5234 today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month high late last week and are consolidating a bit this week. The bulls still have the advantage as a five-week-old uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart. My bias is that the lows are in place. First resistance is now seen at .5250. First support is now seen at .5100.  The June Canadian dollar closed 30 points higher today, at .6498. Prices rebounded today after Monday's key reversal down on the daily bar chart. Bulls lost some the past two sessions, but will gain it right back if prices can push back north soon. Monday's key reversal does not indicate prices are headed back toward the lows seen a few weeks ago. What it does suggest is a downside correction to the recent gains may occur over the near term. This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6548 level. First support is seen at the .6450 level.  The June British pound closed 48 points lower at 1.4200. Trading continues choppy at lower levels. This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling. One could argue that price action the past few weeks has been a ""basing"" before prices eventually turn north. A move above the 1.4500 level would be considered a bullish ""upside breakout"" from the recent congestion area. A move below 1.4100 would be considered a bearish downside breakout. Next support is now seen at the 1.4160 level--today's low. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4300 level.  The June U.S. dollar index closed 2 points lower at 116.22 today. Bulls have the momentum in the near term. The recent double-top reversal on the daily bar chart still favors the bears longer-term. Next resistance lies at the 116.50 level. First support is seen at the 114.50 area. My bias is still that a near-term top is in place in the dollar index.  June U.S. T-bonds closed 18/32 higher today at 102 5/32. Bulls need to show some more resolve, after pushing prices well off the lows scored in late April. A steep six-week-old downtrend line was penetrated on the upside last week and negated. Also, a minor double-bottom reversal has occurred on the daily bar chart. My bias is that odds favor a strong upside move, as opposed to a strong downside move. Next resistance is seen at 103 9/32. First support is seen at 101 11/32 level--today's low.  The June U.S. T-note closed up 13.0 (32nds) today at 105.06.0. Bears still have the slight edge. First support is seen at the 104.16.0 level. First resistance is seen at 105.20.0.

Prices are trading sideways but are still within striking distance of the April high of 1995. Sideways trading the past week has negated a fledgling four-week-old uptrend on the daily bar chart. Bulls still have some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is resistance at the key 2,000 area. First support is seen at the 1,732 area.  June S&P 500 futures closed firmer today. Prices have leveled off the past week, after rallying solidly off the early-April low. Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285 resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00. First support is seen at 1206.00.  LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed $0.28 higher at 70.25 today. Prices scored a consolidative ""inside"" day on the daily bar chart today. On Wednesday, prices gapped sharply lower and hit a fresh eight-month low. Reports that cash cattle traded $1.00 lower this week sent the futures market tumbling. The June futures are still overextended on the downside, technically, on a short-term basis. The bears are in full control of the market. Prices are trading way below an accelerating two-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart. Next support, basis June, is seen at $69.82--Wednesday's low. First resistance comes in at the $70.50 level.  August feeder cattle closed up 53 cents today at $80.00. Prices also posted a corrective rebound after the sharp losses Wednesday. Recent history continues to play out, as the market bounced up from the losses of the past two days. But if prices break down below the bottom of the recent trading range, which is right at Wednesday's low of $87.40, then the door is opened to a lower trend down to the January low just above the $86.00 level. Next resistance is seen at $88.30. First support is seen at $87.40.  June lean hogs closed firmer today. The bears still have the momentum on their side at present. Next support lies at $67.00--today's low. First resistance is located at the 69.00 level.  GRAINS: July corn futures closed 6 3/4 cents lower at $1.98 1/4 today. A bearish USDA report indicating large carryover stocks of corn pushed prices lower today. Prices closed near the session low, after gapping sharply lower on the daily bar chart. Prices were under pressure earlier this week after weekly crop progress reports showed good corn-planting progress in the U.S. The past 25 years of chart history shows nearby corn futures prices do not stay below $2.00 very long. However, the shorter-term technicals are very bearish at present, and would-be bottom pickers don't want to stand in front of a freight train. Next support is now seen at $1.95. Next resistance is seen at today's high of $2.03.  July soybeans closed 4 1/2 cents lower at $4.35 today. Prices closed near the session low amid a bearish USDA report released this morning. The bearish report did put pressure on the market, but not the strong pressure corn saw. Traders have factored much of the bearish news into the soybean market. Odds are lessening that a minor bull flag could be forming on the daily bar chart. Bears still have the solid advantage. Fundamentally, there is not much in the way of good news for bulls right now. I would not be surprised to see the commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term. It's going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force prices solidly higher. First resistance is seen at the $4.45 area and then $4.50. First support is seen at $4.30.  July soybean meal closed off $1.80 at $154.50 today. Prices did not put in that bad of a performance today, given the bearish USDA report. Prices this week are consolidating after they pushed to a fresh eight-week high last Friday. Recent price action is still encouraging to the bulls and is one sign the lows are in place in the meal market. Next resistance comes in at the $158.50 area. First support is seen at $154.00.  July bean oil closed 6 points lower at 14.77 cents today. Prices scored a fresh contract low today of 14.75 cents. Oil is technically weaker than beans or meal right now. But I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil. Next resistance comes in at 15.00 cents. Next support is seen at 14.50 cents.  July Chicago wheat closed 2 3/4 cents higher at $2.68 1/2 today. A bullish USDA report boosted wheat higher, but prices did back off from the highs and close near the session low, due mostly to the weakness in corn and soybeans. Prices just Wednesday touched the contract low of $2.65. If prices can post a strong bounce in the next couple sessions, a double-bottom reversal pattern could be forming on the daily bar chart. Bears are in command. Serious technical damage has occurred the past few sessions. First support lies at the contract low of $2.65. Next resistance is seen at $2.73--today's high.  K.C. July HRW wheat closed up 5 cents at $3.27 1/4 today. A bullish USDA wheat production figure today boosted HRW. Prices gapped higher on the daily bar chart, but backed well off the highs by the close. It will be important for bulls to show some follow-through strength on Friday. Serious chart damage has been inflicted the past few sessions and bears still rule. For bulls to get back in the ballgame, they need to push prices north and fill the downside gap on the daily bar chart (created last week) by pushing prices to the $3.34 area. That's a tall order right now. Next resistance is seen at the $3.31 level-- today's high. Next support is seen at $3.21 1/2.  SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 6 points higher at 9.06 cents today. We now could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar, on the daily bar chart. This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains. A three-month high was scored in July sugar late last week. The bulls have good momentum and a steep and accelerating six-week-old uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now comes in at 9.25 cents. First support is now seen at 8.80 cents.  July N.Y. coffee closed 65 points higher at 68.55 cents today. Prices closed near the session high. The bulls have gained momentum of late. This recent upmove is the most significant showing by the bulls since mid-January. The fact that prices have not sold off sharply the past few sessions is encouraging for the bulls, too--given recent price history. Still, the bears could be setting a trap, like they did in early January. If bulls can push prices above 70 cents and then see follow-through strength, bears will begin to think this uptrend is sustainable. First resistance comes in at 70 cents. First support is seen 65.00 cents.  July N.Y. cocoa closed $28 higher today, at $1,050. Prices today matched the six-week high scored yesterday, and finished close to the session high. Tuesday's strong gap-higher trade on the daily bar chart put the bulls back on a level playing field with the bears. If prices can push higher Friday, bulls will have the edge. Prices this week pushed above and negated a 2.5-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart. Next resistance comes in at $1,060. First support is now seen at $1,025.  July cotton closed 60 points lower at 44.83 cents today. Prices scored a new contract low in the wake of a bearish USDA report. However, most traders did expect the bearish figures in the report--namely high carryover stocks. Cotton is presently in a strong bear market. Right now, any rebounds are likely to be just selling opportunities for the bears. But, my bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process. Next support lies at 44.00 cents. First resistance is seen around 47.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers should beware.  July orange juice futures closed 80 points higher today, at 79.50 cents. Prices closed near the session high again today after Wednesday pushing higher and filling an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart. Today's USDA report was termed mostly neutral by the trade. Bulls are gaining confidence after the past two days' action. Next resistance is now seen at 80.00 cents. Next support comes in at 78.00 cents.  METALS: June COMEX gold closed off $0.90 today, at $269.50. Prices corrected a bit today after Wednesday's strong gains that pushed prices to a two-month high. This market is in a nice uptrend since scoring its early-April low. This week's type of price action is what bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart. Next resistance is located at $273. First support is seen at $268.00.  July silver closed down $0.065 today, at $4.35 an ounce. Prices sold off sharply today after rallying sharply Wednesday. This should not surprise many. Silver prices are still not that far above the contract low. Prices are chopping at lower levels, and this suggests a ""basing"" action that many markets need to change the trend from down, to sideways, to eventually up. Next support is seen at $4.30. First resistance is seen at $4.425. Bears still have the advantage.  July N.Y. copper closed 40 points lower today, at 75.95 cents. Prices today matched the contract low scored in early April. The stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper. Next resistance is seen at 77.00 cents. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents.  ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.12 higher at $29.06 today. Prices closed well off the high of $29.43. Bulls and bears are still at a stand-off, but bull will gain the edge on a move above $29.50. Expect more choppy trading. Next support is seen at 28.00. Next resistance lies at $29.50.  July heating oil closed 5 points higher today, at .7715. Bulls still have the slight edge. Look for more choppy trading in the near future. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents. Next resistance is seen at 79.00 cents.  July unleaded gasoline closed 29 points lower at 1.0040 today. Prices scored a new contract high just Monday. Bulls are still in command as peak driving season nears. Top-pickers beware! Next resistance is seen at $1.03. First support is seen at $.9780.  July natural gas closed 13.7 cents higher at $4.41 today. After, prices hit a fresh five-and-one-half-month Wednesday, we saw a corrective bounce today. Next support is seen at $4.20 and first resistance is at $4.50. This market is still short-term oversold, technically.  FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 32 points lower at .8812 today. Prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down today and pushed to a fresh four-week low. Bears have the edge. The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates today, which initially boosted the Euro, but those gains were short-lived. My bias is still that there is not much downside left in the Euro. Look for more choppy action in the near term. Next support is now seen at .8750. Next resistance is seen at .8900.  The June Japanese yen closed 33 points lower at .8190 today. Bears are in control. Bulls are hoping for some ""basing"" activity at lower levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell. Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at the .8326 level.  The June Swiss franc closed 3 points lower at .5744. Bears are in command as prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar chart today. Prices pushed to a fresh four-week low today. Still, my bias is that prices won't deteriorate much more. Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at the .5800 level.  The June Australian dollar futures closed unchanged at .5234 today. Prices pushed to another fresh two-month high today. The bulls have the advantage as a six-week-old uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart. First resistance is now seen at .5300. First support is now seen at .5200.  The June Canadian dollar closed 20 points lower today, at .6478. Monday's key reversal does not indicate prices are headed back toward the lows seen a few weeks ago. What it does suggest is a downside correction to the recent gains may occur over the near term. Bulls still have the slight edge, on a short-term basis. This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6548 level. First support is seen at the .6450 level.  The June British pound closed 18 points higher at 1.4218. Trading continues choppy at lower levels. This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling. One could argue that price action the past few weeks has been a ""basing"" before prices eventually turn north. A move above the 1.4500 level would be considered a bullish ""upside breakout"" from the recent congestion area. A move below 1.4100 would be considered a bearish downside breakout. Next support is now seen at the 1.4160 level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4300 level.  The June U.S. dollar index closed 30 points higher at 116.52 today. Prices scored a bullish ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart, and pushed to a fresh four-week high. Bulls have the momentum in the near term. Next resistance lies at the 117.00 level. First support is seen at the 115.50 area. My bias is still that a near-term top is in place in the dollar index, but if prices push above the 117.00 area in the near term, odds increase that a new high will be scored.  June U.S. T-bonds closed 1 6/32 lower today at 101 1/32. Bulls today lost most of the momentum they had gained last week. A surprise interest rate cut by the European Central Bank pressured the U.S. debt market. See more on the bond market in this evening's newsletter. Next support is seen at 100 even--par. First resistance is seen at 102 16/32 level.  The June U.S. T-note closed off 27.0 (32nds) today at 104.12.5. Bears have the slight edge and prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar chart today. First support is seen at the 104.00.0 level. First resistance is seen at 105.10.5--today's high.

Light pressure came from today's retail sales report that came in above consensus along with an unexpected rebound in consumer sentiment. Both markets are likely to remain range bound for the time being. It will take closes above last week's highs or below the late-April reaction lows to clear up near-term direction in these markets.  The Dow closed lower on Friday and below this spring's uptrend line due to light profit taking ahead of the weekend and next week's FOMC meeting. The latest economic data suggests that any further cuts in interest rates by the Fed next week might be their last for the time being. The Dow has become extremely overbought and overdue for a correction. Closes below last week's low crossing at 10,673.20 would signal that a larger-degree decline might be unfolding this spring.  INTEREST RATES June bonds plunged to new lows for the year following the release of the University of Michigan's May consumer sentiment that came in at 92.6 verses 88.4 in April. Additional pressure came from April's retail sales data, which came in above pre- report estimates. Odds of a 50-basis-point cut in interest rates next Tuesday are now estimated at 73% verses 83% last Friday. Today's breakout below the 50% retracement level of the 2000-01 rally crossing at 99- 30 opened the door for a likely test of the 62% retracement level crossing at 98-07 later this month. Short-term momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible.  The CRB INDEX closed out the week near session lows as it extended its decline off last Friday's high. This week's breakout below April's uptrend line along with a downturn by a number of momentum indicators confirmed that last week's high marked a double top while opening the door for sideways to lower prices for the last half of May. Weakness in grains, meats, precious metals, some foods and energies weighed on the CRB today.  ENERGY MARKETS closed mostly lower on Friday due to profit taking ahead of the weekend. Today's sell off in the product markets was triggered by rumors that President Bush will take early action to provide relief from higher energy prices. Additional pressure came from talk that other states will follow California and attempt to opt out of the reformulated gasoline program.  June crude oil posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close on Friday as it consolidated some of this week's gains. However, June crude remains range bound leaving the door open for two-sided action. Momentum indicators are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices near-term are possible. However, it will take closes above 30.13 or below 26.75 to clear up near-term direction in the market.  June heating oil closed lower on Friday due to profit taking following Thursday's test of minor resistance crossing at 77.80. Closes above this resistance level or below 73.10 are needed to confirm a breakout of a three-week old trading range. Momentum indicators are neutral to bullish hinting that sideways to higher prices near-term are possible.  June unleaded gas closed sharply lower on Friday following rumors that President Bush will take action to provide relief from high gasoline prices. Friday's setback led to a test of this spring's uptrend line crossing near 105.10. Multiple closes below the uptrend line and last week's low crossing at 101.90 would confirm a top and trendline breakout. Momentum indicators have been showing bearish divergence, which is often a precursor to a top and trend change.  June Henry Hub natural gas posted a downside reversal on Friday thereby ending Thursday's short covering bounce. Additional weakness on Monday is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern as the door remains open for a test of the 75% retracement level of the 1999/2000 rally crossing at 3.625 later this spring. The rising ADX signals that additional weakness during May is possible.  CURRENCIES The June Dollar closed higher on Friday thereby confirming Thursday's key reversal up. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that additional gains are possible next week. If this month's rally continues, this spring's double top crossing at 117.89 is June's next target.  The June Swiss Franc and D-mark closed out the week at or near session lows against the Dollar following the release of the latest U.S. economic data. Both markets are poised to test their April lows, which mark key support levels. Closes below these lows would confirm a downside breakout of this spring's trading range while renewing the larger-degree downtrends. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term appears likely.  The June Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower on Friday after forming a small bear flag earlier in the week. Today's resumption of the decline off last Friday's high sets the stage for additional weakness during the last half of May with April's conservative uptrend line crossing near .6414 being the next likely downside target. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.  The June Japanese Yen closed steady on Friday in two- sided trading as it consolidated some of this week's losses. Session lows fell just short of testing April's uptrend line, which crosses near .8166. Multiple closes below this support level would open the door for sideways to lower prices during the last half of May. Momentum indicators have turned bearish and warn traders that additional weakness near-term is possible.  PRECIOUS METALS June gold closed lower on Friday as it extended Thursday's setback due to light profit taking ahead of the weekend. Nevertheless, this week's upside breakout of the 2000-01 downtrend line has confirmed that a major bottom and trend change has taken place. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices near-term are possible. If this spring's rally continues, March's high crossing at 276.20 is June's next upside objective.  July silver posted an inside day with a lower close as it consolidates above the lower boundary of this spring's trading range crossing at 4.31. Closes below 4.31 are needed to confirm a trading range breakout and trend change. However, momentum indicators are oversold warning bears to use caution as a short-term bottom might be in or near. Closes above this week's high at 4.425 are needed before a low can be confirmed.  July copper posted an inside day with a higher close due to light short covering following Thursday's test of April's low crossing at 75.60. Multiple closes below this support level are needed to confirm a breakout and resumption of this spring's decline. If a breakout is confirmed, weekly support crossing at 74.10 is July's next target. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.  GRAINS July corn closed out the week on a low note and near session lows due to spillover selling following Thursday's bearish supply/demand report. This week's breakout below key weekly support crossing at 2.02 has both renewed this year's decline and set the stage for the next level of weekly support crossing at 1.91 1/2 later this month. Today's losses were limited, as traders were cautious ahead of Monday's planting progress report and this afternoon's extended weather forecasts. Planting delays continue plague farmers in the western Corn Belt while dry parts of the eastern Corn Belt received some rains during the week. I would not be surprised to see a short covering bounce on Monday however, the bearish tone that has engulfed the corn market will continue to limit upside potential near-term.  July wheat closed higher on Friday as the smaller- than-expected U.S. winter wheat crop and all-wheat production forecasts from Thursday's supply/demand report continues to underpin the market. Gains were limited due to weakness in the corn market. Traders will be closely watching Monday's planting progress and crop conditions reports for near-term direction. Closes above broken trendline support crossing near 2.72 would temper the bearish outlook in July wheat while increasing the odds that this week's lows marked a double bottom.  SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed fractionally higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead of the weekend. However, Thursday's bearish supply/demand report and corn planting delays in the western Corn Belt continue to limit upside potential. Momentum indicators have become overbought and are turning neutral to bearish signaling that May's correction in time might have come to an end. I am looking for sideways to lower soybean prices during the last half of May with April's low being a possible target.  July soybean meal posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday as it consolidated some of Thursday's losses. However, upside potential remains limited in the face of bearish soybean fundamentals. Momentum indicators have become overbought and are turning neutral to bearish warning traders to use caution as this spring's corrective rebound might have come to an end. Closes below this week's low would likely trigger additional long-liquidation next week.  LIVESTOCK June hogs closed steady on Friday, as gains were limited due to sharp losses in bellies. Commercial buying prompted by strong cash bids that were up $0.50 to $1.00 higher on the day supported prices. Sluggish hog movement and inadequate packer inventories continue to support the cash market, which has underpinned the late-week rally. Technically, June hogs continue to rebound off the 2000-01 uptrend line, which is to be expected following April's sharp decline. Until this support level is broken, this spring's setback is nothing more than a correction within a bull market.  June cattle closed lower on Friday as it posted a downside reversal. Session highs spiked above broken support crossing at 70.52. Additional weakness on Monday is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. If this spring's decline resumes, last September's low at 69.72 then weekly support crossing at 69.25 are potential targets. Both weekly and daily momentum indicators are bearish but nearing their respective oversold zones hinting that an important low might be near.  FOOD & FIBER July coffee posted a downside reversal on Friday erasing Thursday's gains. Momentum indicators have become very overbought warning traders to use caution as a short-term top might be in or near. July's inability to fill March's gap at 70.25 underscores the weak tone of the market. Closes below Thursday's low at 66.25 would confirm that this spring's short covering bounce has likely come to an end.  July cocoa posted a huge key reversal down on Friday due to profit taking that erased much of this week's gains. Additional weakness on Monday is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. From a broader perspective, July cocoa needs to close above 1103 or below 955 to confirm a breakout of this spring's trading range.  July sugar closed modestly higher on Friday as it continues to form a small symmetrical triangle. A breakout in either direction of this consolidation formation will point the direction of the next trending move. If this spring's rally resumes, January's high at 941 is July's next target. Closes below this week's low at 890 would increase the odds that a short-term top has likely been posted.  July cotton posted a key reversal up on Friday due to short covering ahead of the weekend. Nevertheless, Friday's high did nothing more than test broken support crossing at 45.50. Multiple closes above this broken support level are needed to temper the bearish outlook in the market. If this spring's decline continues, psychological support crossing at 40 cents is July's next downside target later this month.

"TODAY'S HEADLINES The New York Times on the Web Saturday, May 12, 2001 ------------------------------------------------------------ For news updated throughout the day, visit www.nytimes.com    QUOTE OF THE DAY =========================  ""WASHINGTON, May 11 President Bush said today that the surest and swiftest way to help Americans cope with rising gas and oil prices was to enact a sweeping tax cut, which he said would give them more money to pay for the increases. ""If I had my way, I'd have it in place tomorrow, so that people would have money in their pockets to deal with high energy prices,"" Mr. Bush said at news conference in the White House. ""The Congress needs to act."" Mr. Bush's comments came a day after the Senate, like the House, approved a budget plan that calls for $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over the next 11 years, and Mr. Bush sought to seize that momentum, urging both chambers of Congress to pass the tax cut itself before their Memorial Day recess. Mr. Bush also sought to link his push for a tax cut to the nation's energy woes more strongly than ever before. He cited those woes as a rationale for a reduction in taxes, and he cited a tax cut as an answer to those woes. After several weeks in which administration officials had cautioned Americans that there was little if anything that their energy policy, to be unveiled on Thursday, could do to help consumers in the short term, Mr. Bush today pitched his tax cut as, in fact, a ready-made remedy. And he did so at a time of growing worry among Republicans that rising gas and oil prices could seriously damage his presidency. ""Let me say it again, see if I can be more clear,"" the president said in response to one of many questions about other approaches to dealing with energy problems. ""To the Congress, who is interested in helping consumers pay high gas prices: `Pass the tax relief as quickly as possible.' ""We've set aside $100 billion to help consumers with high energy prices,"" Mr. Bush continued, referring to a part of the suggested tax cut that would be distributed among taxpayers this year. ""That's the quickest way to help consumers. I am deeply concerned about consumers. I'm deeply concerned about high gas prices. To anybody who wants to figure out how to help the consumers, pass the tax relief package as quickly as possible."" Many low-income people, who are least able to afford a steep escalation in the cost of cooling their homes or filling their cars, would receive only modest amounts of money from the tax cut Mr. Bush has proposed. Beyond that, the poorest of these people, who pay no taxes, may not receive any financial relief at all from a tax cut. But Mr. Bush and his advisers clearly craved an opportunity for the president to appear empathetic and in charge of the situation amid predictions by some analysts that the price of a gallon of gas could reach $3 this summer. Today's news conference, which was almost 30 minutes long, was the third in the White House the president had held since his inauguration nearly four months ago. Mr. Bush also wanted to claim victory for the Congressional passage of a budget plan with a tax cut only slightly smaller than the one he initially proposed. And he expressed support for Attorney General John Ashcroft's decision, announced shortly before Mr. Bush spoke, to delay until June 11 the planned execution of Timothy J. McVeigh. ""He is lucky to be an American,"" Mr. Bush said of Mr. McVeigh. ""This is a country that will bend over backwards to make sure that his constitutional rights are guaranteed, as opposed to rushing his fate."" The president added that the failure of F.B.I. officials to turn over documents to which Mr. McVeigh's defense lawyers were entitled had neither persuaded him that Mr. McVeigh was unjustly convicted nor shaken his faith in the fairness with which the death penalty is meted out. As the governor of Texas, Mr. Bush presided over more than 150 executions in six years. Asked about the recent expulsion of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Mr. Bush grew more animated than usual, his anger evident. ""The decision was an outrageous decision,"" he said. ""To me it undermines the whole credibility of this commission."" Like Mr. Bush's two previous White House news conferences, this one was announced only shortly before it began, and Mr. Bush for a third time eschewed the formal trappings of the East Room for the less formal press briefing room. He seemed determined to maintain a jocular demeanor even about grave subjects, smiling and laughing for a moment before answering a question about a 4-month-old Palestinian baby killed by Israeli fire this week. The issue he discussed most was energy, as he set the stage for his administration's announcement of its policy, one that will call for the construction of power plants and more oil and gas exploration on federal lands. Many voters are concerned about the environmental repercussions of such measures, and Mr. Bush sought both to address those concerns and to assert that energy problems were long in the making and would be long in the solving. ""This is a situation that's been developing over the years, and it's going to take a while to correct,"" Mr. Bush said, presenting himself as the blunt bearer of mixed tidings and later adding, ""I'm going to tell the truth when it comes to energy: that we have a serious problem, that we need to do a couple of things."" ""We need to be more conservation- minded in America,"" he said. ""But I'm also going to say, as plainly as I can, we won't conserve our way to energy independence. We must also increase supply."" Mr. Bush's discussion of the nation's energy problems in some ways mirrored his evaluations of the economy, in which he has gone out of his way to document that he inherited a troubling situation. He said today that he hoped an economic recovery would be imminent, but that ""there's no question that the minute I got elected, the storm clouds on the horizon were getting nearly directly overhead.""""  - ,  Full Story:    NATIONAL =========================  Ashcroft Delays Death of McVeigh Over F.B.I.'s Lapse http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/12/national/12EXEC.html  The West Is Culling Forests That Fueled Fires of the Past http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/12/national/12FIRE.html  Dartmouth Expels Fraternity Over Articles http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/12/national/12DART.html  Texas Governor Signs Hate Crimes Bill http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/12/national/12TEXA.html     /--------------------- ADVERTISEMENT ---------------------\  50% Off New York Times Home Delivery  Enjoy the award winning journalism of The New York Times with the added benefit of convenient home delivery.

"*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Daily Riddle ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Today's Riddle is -   Today we have two riddles again.  1. What common English verb becomes its own past tense by rearranging its letters?  2. If it takes a man one hour to dig a hole two meters long, two meters wide, and two meters deep, how long would it take the same man to dig a hole four meters long, four meters wide, and four meters deep, assuming he digs at the same rate of speed?

Answer: Eat becomes Ate 2. Eight hours. It takes twice as long to double the length, twice as long to double the width, and twice as long to double the depth. To find cubic measurement you multiply length x width x height; therefore, on the first hole, one hour equals 2 m x 2 m x 2 m or 8 cubic meters. On the second hole, the formula is 4 m x 4 x 4 m or 64 cubic meters.   =============================================================   --- You are currently subscribed to riddles as: mike.grigsby@enron.com To unsubscribe send a blank email to leave-riddles-8238I@riddlesandmore.net",mike.grigsby@enron.com,riddles@riddlesandmore.com,Daily Riddle for 05/13/2001 - Past tense and Hole digging,2001-05-12 17:10:00-07:00,received

"we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may  11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are  going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal  goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank  wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Matthew Lenhart/HOU/ECT on 05/14/2001  01:31 PM ---------------------------   ""Aberle, Derek"" <DerekAberle@aec.ca> on 05/14/2001 11:42:24 AM To: ""'mlenhart@enron.com'"" <mlenhart@enron.com> cc:    Subject: Liquidated Damages Pertaining to May 11 Gas Day    Matt   I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can regain trading together in the future.

"Mike,  I am not sure what role you might have played on the below Sitara deals since  they are EOL deals so bare with me.  It looks as though all of Calpine's physical gas deals have been moved over  to Calpine Energy Services (CES).  In other words, they have billed all gas  under the CES entity for Apr-01 production.  However, it looks as though  these deals were booked in EOL.  If that is the case, can you confirm that a  Clapine trader actually entered these deals?  If so, do you know who that  trader is?  If not, what can be done to change the counterparty name on these  deals to Calpine Energy Services?  Any help would be appreciated.  693570 696681 694495 697218 697607 699216  Thank you, Scott Dozier Physical Gas Settlements 5-7213",mike.grigsby@enron.com,scott.dozier@enron.com,CPN Gas Marketing Buy Deals - Apr/01,2001-05-14 08:54:00-07:00,received

Prices hit a fresh two-week low today, but have been trading sideways for several weeks. The sideways trading favors the bulls, but they still have some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is resistance at the key 2,000 area. First support is seen at the 1,732 area.  June S&P 500 futures closed 0.20 higher at 1252.00. Same story: Prices have leveled off the past four weeks, after rallying solidly off the early-April low. This does favor the bulls, but not greatly. Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285 resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00. First support is seen at 1206.00.  LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed $0.58 higher at 70.75 today. Prices rebounded from a technically oversold condition today, and on news that boxed beef prices had improved. Last week, prices hit a fresh multi-month low. Still, prices are in an accelerating two-month-old downtrend on the daily bar chart and bears have control. Next support, basis June, is seen at $70.25. First resistance comes in at the $71.00 level.  August feeder cattle closed off 22 cents today at $87.65. The rally in the corn market today hurt feeders. If recent history continues to play out in feeders, prices may dip a bit more, but the support area of 87.40 will cap losses. That is the lower level of the trading band in place for the past several weeks. If prices break down below the bottom of the recent trading range, then the door is opened to a lower trend down to the January low just above the $86.00 level. Next resistance is seen at $88.00. First support is seen at $87.60 and then at $87.40.  June lean hogs closed $0.25 higher at $68.80 today. Commercial buying was seen in the futures pits, reports said. Price action today saw more consolidation after the strong losses recorded in recent weeks. But the bears still have the momentum on their side at present. Next support lies at $67.00. First resistance is located at the 69.50 level.  GRAINS: July corn futures closed 4 1/2 cents higher at $2.01 3/4 today. Another ""mini"" weather scare popped prices today. Two important things to point out here: One, July corn (now the nearby contract) did not stay below the key $2.00-per-bushel level very long. Secondly, notice how even some hot temps forecast for mid-May popped prices higher. I suspect that with prices this low going into the growing season, this type of knee-jerk reaction to any changes in the weather patterns will be the norm. Still, bottom pickers should beware. Next resistance is now seen at $2.04. Next support is seen at $2.00.  July soybeans closed 7 1/2 cents higher at $4.43 1/4 today. Like corn, beans were boosted by a ""mini"" weather scare and ideas that now there may not be significant corn acres switched to soybeans. Importantly, the bean market did not fare that badly, technically, last week, in the face of the sell offs in corn and wheat futures. Today's big upside push propelled prices to a fresh five-week high and pushed prices above a stiff resistance area at $4.45. Bears still have the advantage. It's going to take a ""significant"" weather scare this spring or summer to force soybean prices solidly higher. First resistance is now seen at the $4.50 area and then $4.55. First support is now seen at $4.35.  July soybean meal closed up $3.60 at $159.40 today. Prices today pushed to a fresh nearly three-month-high. Importantly, prices pushed above the congestion area on the  daily bar chart that had contained gains for better than a week. Recent price action is very encouraging to the bulls and is a solid sign the lows are in place in the meal market. Next resistance comes in at the $162.00 area. First support is seen at $156.00.  July bean oil closed 7 points higher at 14.73 cents today. Prices scored another new contract low today of 14.62 cents. Oil is still technically weaker than beans or meal right now. But I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil. Next resistance comes in at 15.00 cents. Next support is seen at 14.50 cents.  July Chicago wheat gapped higher on the daily bar chart and closed 7 1/4 cents higher at $2.78 1/2 today. Hot and dry weather forecast for the U.S. Plains states this week combined with a bullish USDA report last Thursday to send prices sharply higher today. Now, odds have increased that a double-bottom reversal on the daily bar chart will be confirmed. The fact that wheat was technically oversold also led to the stronger upside movement today. Prices last Wednesday touched the contract low of $2.65. Bears still have the slight edge, but bulls are gaining confidence rapidly. First resistance lies at the $2.80 area. Next support is seen at $2.75.  SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 9 points lower at 9.01 cents today. Prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar chart today. We still could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar, but prices would need to bounce right back higher soon. Bulls can still correctly argue that today's pullback was just consolidation amid good prices gains seen recently. A three-month high was scored in July sugar just recently. A six-week-old uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now comes in at 9.15 cents--today's high. First support is seen at 8.80 cents.  July N.Y. coffee closed 3.40 cents lower at 64.25 cents today. Prices gapped lower on the daily bar chart and let some of the air out of the bulls' balloon. They had gained momentum lately. Not much technical damage will occur if prices can rebound, but if good follow-through selling occurs Tuesday, then odds significantly increase that prices will test the recent lows. First support comes in at 62 cents. First resistance is seen at 67.00 cents-- today's high.  July N.Y. cocoa closed $10 higher today, at $1,024. Prices scored a corrective ""inside day"" on the daily bar chart today, following Friday's big sell off. The bears wanted to see follow-through selling today to confirm a bearish key reversal down on the daily bar chart, but that did not occur. Bulls and bears are still on a level playing field. Next resistance comes in at $1,062. First support is now seen at $1,000.  July cotton closed 153 points higher at 46.70 cents today. Hot and dry weather in the cotton-growing regions of the U.S. combined with a technically oversold condition on the market to push prices solidly higher today. The cotton market will be like the grains. Prices are so depressed that traders will be extra jumpy when any potentially adverse weather patterns are forecast. There was good follow-through buying today from Friday's ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart, and a key reversal up was confirmed. This gives the bulls a bit more confidence. Cotton is still in a bear market and any rebounds may be selling opportunities for the bears. Let's see what happens this week. My bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process. Next resistance lies at 48.00 cents. First support now is seen around 45.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers should still beware.  July orange juice futures closed 30 points higher today, at 79.20 cents. Prices closed near the session high. Last week, bulls filled an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart. They have gained confidence after the recent price action, but will need to see more upside action this week--pushing prices above 80 cents--to gain solid momentum. Next resistance is seen at 80.00 cents. Next support comes in at 77.60 cents--today's low.  July lumber futures closed the limit of $10.00 higher again today, at $324.80. Prices today again gapped higher and hit a new for-the-move high. Bulls are really snorting now. Expect more volatility, as is typical for this market. The next upside objective for the bulls is now the $330.00 area, and then $335.00. First support is seen at the $315.00 area. This is a fun market to watch from the sidelines. But the volatility can be a killer to those who are caught on the wrong side of the lumber market.  METALS: June COMEX gold closed up $0.40 today, at $268.70. Prices corrected a bit more today after last Wednesday's strong gains that pushed prices to a two-month high. This market is in a nice uptrend since scoring its early-April low. Recent price action is what bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart. Next resistance is located at $271.10--the recent high. First support is seen at $266.00.  July silver closed up $0.02 today, at $4.357 an ounce. Same story: Silver prices are not that far above the contract low. Prices are chopping at lower levels, and this suggests a ""basing"" action that many markets need to change the trend from down, to sideways, to eventually up. Next support is seen at $4.30. First resistance is seen at $4.425. Bears have the advantage.  July N.Y. copper closed 85 points lower today, at 75.50 cents. A bearish U.S. economic report today pulled copper prices down to a new contract low. The stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper. Next resistance is seen at 77.00 cents. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents.  ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.06 higher at $29.13 today. Bulls and bears are still at a stand-off, but bulls will gain the edge on a move above $29.50. Expect more choppy trading. Next support is seen at 28.00. Next resistance lies at $29.50.  July heating oil closed 86 points lower today, at .7566. Bulls still have the slight edge. Look for more choppy trading in the near future. Next support is seen at 74.00 cents. Next resistance is seen at 78.00 cents.  July unleaded gasoline closed 302 points lower at .9428 today. After prices scored a new contract high last week, they have sold off dramatically. The increase in volatility at higher price levels suggests a topping process in the market. Bulls have lost their edge. Next support is seen at $.9200. First resistance is seen at $.9600.  July natural gas closed 11.5 cents higher at $4.465 today. After, prices hit a fresh five-and-one-half-month low last Wednesday, we've seen corrective consolidation. Bears still have the edge. Next support is seen at $4.20 and first resistance is at $4.60.  STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 20 points lower at .8740 today. Prices pushed to another fresh four-week low today. Bears have the edge. My bias is still that there is not much downside left in the Euro, but the markets are always right, so we'll see. Next support is now seen at .8700. Next resistance is seen at .8850.  The June Japanese yen closed 47 points lower at .8143 today. Bears are in control. Bulls are hoping for some ""basing"" activity at lower levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell. Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at the .8326 level.  The June Swiss franc closed 10 points lower at .5713. Bears are in command. Prices pushed to a fresh 5.5-month low today, and took out the mid-April low of .5702. If we see follow-through selling to push prices significantly below today's low, that a bearish signal and portends significantly more downside. A 4.5-month-old downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart, and it has accelerated recently. Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at the .5800 level.  The June Australian dollar futures closed 22 points lower at .5193 today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month high last Thursday and the bulls have the advantage as a six- week-old uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart. First resistance is now seen at .5300. First support is now seen at .5150.  The June Canadian dollar closed 4 points lower today, at .6444. Bulls are losing momentum as prices correct from the push to the May high. They still have the slight edge, on a short-term basis, but they will lose it if they can't turn prices at least sideways this week. This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6500 level. First support is seen at the .6400 level.  The June British pound closed 4 points lower at 1.4182. Trading continues choppy at lower levels. As prices approach the lower portion of the recent trading range, strong support should kick in and provide for a bounce. But if prices fall below the early April low of 1.4112, then the door is open to much steeper losses. This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling. One could still argue that price action the past few weeks has been a ""basing"" before prices eventually turn north. A move below 1.4100 would be considered a bearish downside breakout. Next support is now seen at the 1.4112 level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4270 level.  The June U.S. dollar index closed 24 points higher at 117.22 today. Prices also pushed to a fresh four-week high again today. Next resistance lies at the 117.70 level. First support is seen at the 115.50 area. My bias is still that there is not much upside left in the dollar index. But this week technical odds have increased that a new high will be scored. We'll see. Markets are never wrong-- analysts are.  June U.S. T-bonds closed 14/32 higher today at 99 20/32. Prices scored a corrective ""inside day"" today after Friday's price crash to a six-month low. All eyes are on this week's FOMC meeting, at which a decision will be made on whether or not to cut interest rates. Trading will likely be subdued up to the time of the announcement, which is set to occur tomorrow afternoon. Short-term indicators show the market is still overdone on the downside, but nobody should stand in front of a steaming locomotive. Longer-term charts do show good support at the 99 even area. First resistance is now seen at 100 even-- or ""par.""  The June U.S. T-note closed up 12.0 (32nds) today at 103.11.0. Prices scored a corrective ""inside day"" after crashing to a five-month low Friday. Bears have the edge now, as severe technical damage has been inflicted this week. First support is seen at the 102.29.0 level. First resistance is seen at 103.16.0 area.

"we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Matthew Lenhart/HOU/ECT on 05/14/2001 01:31 PM ---------------------------   ""Aberle, Derek"" <DerekAberle@aec.ca> on 05/14/2001 11:42:24 AM To: ""'mlenhart@enron.com'"" <mlenhart@enron.com> cc:    Subject: Liquidated Damages Pertaining to May 11 Gas Day    Matt   I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend traded as low as $3.70.

Unbundling:  PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.     SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval.   Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.  Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

"  Dear Western Region:   I would like to thank Phillip Allen for his leadership of the west desk for 2000 and 2001.  He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group.  Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts.  I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately.   I would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group.  I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward.   Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model.  The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.  West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.       The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.    Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.    Sincerely,  Michael D.

What this means is that NP will nominate the supply gas into the pipeline and deliver to themselves as they are the market for the whole volume and term. ENA will have to instruct NP what our supply looks like ( on a daily basis)    We have sold all the Kern gas to SPPC for the entire period.... at a Socal Monthly Index minus $.42/$.95 related price and our obligation is 100% takes.   I know some supply has been purchased for the term but some gas will be procured in the spot market.  I expect that Steve South and Paul Lucci will coordinate those efforts as required but we need this gas to show up every day.

SoCal would like to start selling around Oct. 1, so they're expecting (hoping for) a decision in early September.

Daily Gas Price Index  published : August 22, 2001 CA Power Buying Agency Shops for Natural Gas, Too  As part of its 53 long-term electricity contracts, California's Department of Water Resources (DWR) is shopping for a portfolio of natural gas supplies of various duration to use in about half the deals that give the state the option of providing its own fuel supplies when it can beat prevailing market rates used by its power suppliers.  So far, it has seven gas deals in various stages of development with six different marketers, according to Sacramento-based DWR spokesperson Oscar Hidalgo. Two contracts are in effect now with Pan-Canadian Energy Services for July and August strips of gas supplies. At this point, DWR will not talk about how much gas and/or electric supplies are involved.  ""We have a total of seven 'enabling agreements' that allow us to purchase supplies into the future without re-doing the whole contract process each time,"" Hidalgo said. ""What we have now are two executed contracts with Pan-Canadian for gas.  ""It doesn't mean we have to supply gas for the generator (in our long-term contracts), it just means if we can buy gas at a better rate, we have an option to do so. So we're in the early stages of building a gas portfolio that will allow us to bring gas to the deal if it is cost-effective for us to do so.""  DWR is looking at possible storage services as part of its gas deals, said Hidalgo, noting that the state's power-buying agency wants to hedge by having some bulk power deals tied to fixed prices and others using gas tolling arrangements.  In addition to the Canadian company, the five other gas marketers with which DWR is talking are: BP Energy Co.; Coast Energy Group; Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.; Dynegy Marketing and Trade; and Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.

I hope that you had a fine holiday weekend! Mine was great!!  Several committee members have expressed an interest in learning more about the events that lead to and resulted from the unexpected working gas storage number reported a few weeks ago in the AGA American Gas Storage Survey. At the committee's request, the following is a brief message from Chris McGill, managing director of policy analysis, regarding this activity. Please review the material below and attached. By the end of this week or early next week, I will forward to you the summary referenced in the final paragraph below for your comments and/or concerns. Thank you. Have an awesome day!  -----Original Message----- From: McGill, Chris Sent: Tuesday, September 04, 2001 10:23 AM To: Denbow, Kimberly Cc: Wilkinson, Paul; Shin, David; Pierson, Paul Subject:    To: AGA Underground Storage Committee Members:  Thank you for the opportunity to provide an update on the recent activities of AGA's American Gas Storage Survey (AGSS). Certainly, the voluntary survey and resulting estimates of working gas in storage for the nation would not be possible without your help and support. There are three issues I would like to cover in this message, including the recent revision of working gas, an issue of continuing the reporting and current procedures and methods.  Regarding the recent report and subsequent revision of working gas in storage for the Consuming Region East, please know that we continue to follow our procedures for data collection, verification and distribution. Several weeks ago, we flagged several survey submittals that seemed different from traditional patterns in the eastern region for this time of year. Follow-up to the submittals was set in motion, however, were not fully resolved until days after the Wednesday posting period. It is our policy to consider eliminating certain data submittals, if questions arise about the validity of the data. In this case, inclusion of the data or elimination of the data from the computational spreadsheets did not change the fact that a very low net build would be reported for the nation. Because of that we opted to go forward with our estimates and continue to pursue our verification efforts. Simply put, we don't make up numbers for companies when we have an actual report in hand just to create a final estimate of working gas changes that fits more closely with market expectations. What turned out to be a clerical error in the data reported to us was discovered and a revised survey submitted. Our revision of the estimates of working gas in storage for the eastern region and the total US came one week later at our normal reporting period, as is our stated policy for distributing revisions to the public.  The fact is that we have revised our data about 25 times in the past 7.5 years (or about 400 weekly reports). Our accuracy can be clearly documented by comparing the AGSS estimates to that of EIA. The attached slides do just that, as well as show the current level of working gas compared to the prior five-year average. What seems to have developed in the natural gas market, particularly among traders, is a lack of tolerance between what we report and what the market expects. In order to continue our reach for consistency, we are reviewing our methods and procedures to ensure that they continue to reflect the best practices of completing a report such as the weekly estimates of working gas. Our evolving methods and procedures issue brief is attached. Any comments you have on the stated procedures or regarding this memorandum, in general, can be directed to me.  Finally, the issue of whether we continue to report the estimates of working gas publicly remains one to be considered by the AGA Board of Directors. Like all projects at AGA, the AGSS come under periodic scrutiny for its value to the members and to the gas market in general. However, like many real-time information sources, the sequential data set has become sensitive over time. Please be alerted to the fact that a summary is being prepared by AGA for presentation to board members on this issue. It is our intention to copy the Underground Storage Committee on the documentation that is distributed. It seems likely that if AGA discontinues the weekly reporting of working gas that some other entity (federal or otherwise) will pick it up. Again, if you have comments on this memorandum, the attachments to this memo or the AGSS summary to be presented to the AGA Board (not attached but expected to be copied to you soon) please make them to me or to the appropriate person at your company.  I appreciate your attention to this matter. Your support of the American Gas Storage Survey is gratefully acknowledged.   Christopher B.

Some brokers think it likely IPE Brent trade willinish early, around 1630 GMT, Wed in the absence of Nymex. ? Bearish Factors: Suspension of commercial air travel and possible mass cancellations once resumed; Falloff in energy demand due to shut businesses; Possible decline in equity markets and renewed fears over recession ? Bullish Factors: Fear of increased Mideast instability; Possible stockpiling of jet fuel for military use ? As of this morning, bearish factors seem to have the edge, with Brent Crude trading lower in London.  Bullish factors will depend on how the investigation/response develop Canada  ? Provincial, territorial and federal mines and energy ministers cancelled the second day of their two-day meeting in Quebec City. ? Toronto Stock Exchange expected to remain closed today.    B. Transportation/Infrastructure Updates   Gas/Power Infrastructure  ? The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission placed all nuclear power plants, research reactors, nuclear fuel facilities and gaseous diffusion plants on the highest level of security alert Tuesday.  No companies have reported a curtailment of generation as a result of yesterday's attack. ? According to the NY ISO (Independent System Operator) the NY grid was functioning normally following the attacks on the WTC. ? ConEd went into a ""thunderstorm alert"", increasing in-city generation.  Electricity, gas and steam service was suspended in an area in SW Manhattan. ? Natural Gas Intelligence is quoting a source that a force majeure could be declared by pipeline operators as a result of  ""confusion regarding accurate registration of nominations.""  No other confirmation was available. ? The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, which represents the nation's interstate natural gas pipelines, sent out an advisory urging its members follow procedures to increase security. ? Kinder Morgan's Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) froze the status of its flowing gas volumes no longer accepting any changes to confirmed and scheduled volumes.  Gas scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 11 will roll forward and this situation will continue until further notice. ? Enbridge, Alliance, and TransCanada report increased security along pipeline facilities, but no expectations of supply/delivery interruption BPA operating on skeleton crew.  All non-essential personnel was evacuated, however, no threats against the hydro generator have been issued. FERC cancelled regular Wednesday meeting, not rescheduled. Authorities in Chicago barricaded the entrances to power plants and pumping facilities with concrete blocks and heavy trucks. ? Grand Coulee Dam and powerhouse in Washington state operational, but locked down ? Hoover Dam on Nevada-Arizona line is locked down.  Refineries/Crude/Products  ? Tosco refinery in Linden NJ closed.   ? Force Majeure likely to be declared by major crude product receivers in US ports;  ?

FAA ban on outbound flights until noon EST today at the earliest. ? Huge logistics headaches and delays expected by airlines and air traffic controllers once US flights resume. ? Air cargo delays considerable due to rigorous inspections.  Maritime Transportation Conditions  ? St. Lawrence Seaway reopened.  Coast Guard inspections stepped up. ? New York Port closed, not receiving refined projects- Colonial Pipeline deliveries expected to ""catch big premiums.""  Border Crossings  ? Security at all US-Canada border crossings on maximum alert.  Bridges/tunnels closed.  Freight forwarders reporting that freight movements over the border have slowed to a trickle. ? Rail freight moving normally across Canada-US border. ? US-Mexico border reopen, but subject to delays and inspections on US side.  Mexican officials request that Mexican citizens delay trips to the US.   Political Update  International  US Arab allies (Egypt, Saudi, Jordan, Kuwait, UAE) walking a fine line.  Masses believe US got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Washington.  Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect ""state of confusion"" to exist for immediate period ahead.  In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator.   Oil Politics  OPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident ""relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves"" in oil policy.","k..allen@enron.com, eric.bass@enron.com, anne.bike@enron.com,   frank.ermis@enron.com, l..gay@enron.com, mog.heu@enron.com,   keith.holst@enron.com, jason.huang@enron.com,   tori.kuykendall@enron.com, matthew.lenhart@enron.com,   daniel.lisk@enron.com, jay.reitmeyer@enron.com,   monique.sanchez@enron.com, m..scott@enron.com, matt.smith@enron.com,   p..south@enron.com, patti.sullivan@enron.com, m..tholt@enron.com,   barry.tycholiz@enron.com, jason.wolfe@enron.com",mike.grigsby@enron.com,FW: Competitive Analysis Update #4- US Terrorism Attacks,2001-09-12 05:12:32-07:00,sent

Walt    The message below was sent to an old AF buddy who forwarded it on to me with the invitation to disseminate as widely as he saw fit. I send it on to you with the same invitation... It offers some pretty good ideas..  **********************************************************  My name is John Burnett. I am a DC-10 Captain for FedEx. I am also a Police Officer for the Memphis Police Department.   My purpose in writing this is to share some of my thoughts regarding actions a pilot might consider when faced with a modern-day hijacker. These thoughts are ""outside-the-box"" when it comes to the way we've all been trained. Neither the FAA or our companies will suggest these techniques or implement them as a part of our normal training cycles. They couldn't for fear of lawsuits.   I am distributing this via e-mail to buddies I've flown with. I'm asking them to send it to their circle of friends within the industry, and for you to send it to yours. I know most of us have e-mail, and I hope this reaches the next to face the horror of some religious fanatic onboard.   We have all had ""training"" in what to do in case of a hijacking; try to keep the hijacker calm, make him think you're doing what he wants, take him where ever he wants to go, etc., etc., etc. Save your passengers, your crew, and your aircraft.   In an emergency, you will revert to that training. When our unfortunate peers were faced with the screams of the Flight Attendants and hijacker's demands to open the cockpit door, their training probably made them open the door. When the fanatics made demands, their training told them to comply as best they could. I can only wonder what their thoughts were as they left the cockpit and were tied up in the back of the plane; what they thought as they descended over New York....   I hope the fanatics had to kill them in their seats and drag their dead bodies out of the cockpit. But, I bet they did as they were trained to do ..  As you look back over recent hijackings, FedEx, and Egypt Air, and now the September 11th hijackings, you see a perpetrator who, for one reason or another wants to take over the airplane and kill himself. Each of these hijackers, except for the FedEx incident, were successful. They took over the airplane and killed everyone onboard.   If you're following the news programs today, you hear a lot about how we could let these hijackers learn to fly. You would think if knowing how to fly would guarantee a successful hijacking, Auburn Calloway (the FedEx hijacker) would have been a hijacker success story.   Calloway had been a Navy pilot, a martial arts student, a fellow FedEx crew member, and he took all the weapons he needed: hammers, knives and a spear gun. He didn't have to overcome any Flight Attendants or demand they open the cockpit door. He just went back to his bag, took out his hammer came back into the cockpit and started crushing skulls.   The crew members on that flight didn't worry about Flight Attendants, they didn't worry about passengers. All three pilots left the cockpit and fought a hand-to-hand, life-or-death battle.   To survive today's hijacker, you cannot worry about your passengers; you cannot worry about your Flight Attendants. You must develop a mind-set that everyone onboard - including yourself - is already dead. Because, if the hijacker is successful in taking over your airplane, not only you, your crew, your passengers and your aircraft are lost, but thousands on the ground are at risk.   One of the reasons the FedEx crew survived, is the extraordinary actions of the co-pilot. Although he had brain injury, the co-pilot took the DC-10 and immediately executed a half-roll. This maneuver took the hijacker off his feet as the Captain and S/O were struggling with him.   During a point in the maneuver, the hijacker, Captain and S/O were thrown back behind the cockpit door. When he righted the airplane, the F/O then left his seat and joined the fight in the galley area of the plane. It was only after the Captain determined the hijacker was subdued, he returned to the cockpit and flew the airplane to landing.   Very few of us have had to confront true evil. Fewer still have seriously considered taking the life of another human being. I believe this is the reason the FedEx crew did not kill their attacker. The crew's heroism that day is beyond belief. And any action that leads to a safe landing and recovery cannot be argued with.   But, when the Captain left the F/O and S/O, thinking the situation was under control, he was mistaken. The F/O and S/O had sustained serious, life-threatening injuries. The hijacker had not. As the Captain flew the aircraft, the hijacker, who had surrendered, began the fight anew.   As the airplane landed, the hijacker was just moments away from overcoming the two crew members.   I mention this for your consideration. I would suggest that you make a conscious decision to kill anyone who tries to take your airplane from you.  Today we are at war. The hijacker who comes through your cockpit door is going to kill you and everyone onboard. So, how do you do that? What weapons are available to us as pilots?   The intercom. Command that all men come forward and fight with the hijackers. You have many able-bodied men onboard. They are sitting in shock not knowing what to do. Command that they come forward and help you kill your attackers. And, they will come.   The airplane itself. Get the hijackers off their feet. Go into an immediate dive to float them to the ceiling. Then execute a 6G positive maneuver and hope they hit their head or break their back as they hit the floor, galley shelf, etc.   Pull the fire handles, shut the start levers and turn the fuel valves off. If you lose the battle, at least the airplane won't be used as a guided missile on a kamikaze mission. With luck, maybe these guys didn't learn how to do an in-flight restart. Then leave the cockpit - all of you, and kill your attackers - don't believe it when they surrender - don't be nice to them - KILL THEM.   Flare Gun If your airplane has one, the Captain might consider making sure it's loaded and secured next to his bag. I can think of nothing more satisfying than watching a ball of burning phosphorous embedded into a fanatic's gut.   The crash-axe. I would suggest you have your co-pilot take it from it's holder and secure it next to him so he has it immediately available. Makes an excellent skull crusher.   Your flashlight. The FAA use to require a 2 cell. A 3 cell Mag-Light makes an excellent weapon. If your maneuvers have the hijackers on the floor writhing in pain, crush their skulls.   Your stolen hotel bic pen. Drive it into an attacker's eye, ear, throat, or into the area just under the jaw bone. That's a particular interesting place to drive it, because when he opens his mouth to scream, you can read ""Hyatt"" sticking there.   Your hand and fingers Drive your fingers into his eyes and try to feel your fingernails scrape the back of his eye sockets. Scoop the eyeballs out. It will confuse the hell out of him when he finds himself looking at his shoes as they dangle there on the ocular nerves.   Your teeth. Remember Hannibal Lecter. Eat a nose, a cheek, or a finger. And keep eating. Attack with all viciousness. A piranha is a small fish, but it's greatly feared. A hijacker is not expecting you to eat him and it might make him forget why he got on your airplane to begin with. It will, at least, impress his buddies.   Now here's my wish-list of things the FAA could do to help, especially in this time of war.   Arm the Captain  The battle is not going to require any long shots. A small revolver would be a good choice. It would hold off the attackers long enough for you to disable your aircraft.   If the attackers claimed the red package they were holding was a bomb, I'd shoot out the door glass and hope the door would be ripped out and the hijacker and his package would be sucked out. And hey, I if I got sucked out with him, I'd try to fly my body to the hijacker look in his face and laugh at him all the way to the ground.   Invite The Police To Man The Jump Seat Police are always looking for something free. Donut shops use to be a favorite target for robbers - until they started giving donuts to the Police. Robbers don't rob donut shops anymore. I would suggest each Police Department send the FAA a list of the best shots on the department and those guys and their guns would be welcome on my airplane.   Fill every vacant seat with armed Police - give them a donut - and tell them to shoot anyone who gives your Flight Attendant any shit.   Stop this silly no-knife rule. Make it public. Tell the public they're welcome to bring their pocket knives onboard. Then everyone will bring them.  So when you make your Intercom call to the passengers for help, you'll have a dozen or more knife wielding helpers trying to make sure their new Gerber tastes fanatics blood. There are even a few of them who'd want to keep the fanatics ears as souvenirs.   None of us is immune. Take some time and consider your actions if this event should ever happen to you. My prayer is none of you ever have to face this kind of decision.   Best of luck to you, and may God Bless.",monique.sanchez@enron.com,mike.grigsby@enron.com,"FW: new ""rules""...",2001-09-28 10:03:57-07:00,sent

RJ  1. =09The War on the Ground  For the most part, the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the s= pecial forces ""inserted"" into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden. The special = forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use th= e collected intelligence from various sources to ""snatch"" bin Laden and oth= ers, or to find other targets, identify them, and then call in attack aircr= aft.  Such attacks are by now well-priced in and would appear to be unlikel= y to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets.  Over the weekend, the press picked up on our reports from last week that cu= rrently the US has Delta Force, Green Beret, and Army Ranger units on the g= round and some special operation forces ""in-country.""  Also,  British Speci= al Air Service units, the French Regiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de = Marine, and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role. Adv= ance groups of the US 101st and 82nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a we= ek ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan, which is just wes= t of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan, a pass into Afghanistan and to = Kandahar. Allied ground troops, backed by helicopter gunships and armored A= C-130 armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases=  near Tashkent in Uzbekistan.=20  The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower,=  ranging from nearly 150 US Air Force B-1 and B-52 bombers and F-16s and F-= 14s, as well as the nearly 400 aircraft in the four battle carrier groups t= he US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise, the USS = Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Carl Vinson, and the USS Kitty Hawk. In additio= n the British have some 20,000 troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron aro= und the HMS Invincible.  Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide = air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alli= ance, the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban. =20  Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pak= istan, the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and t= he actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a mini= mum.  Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their in= telligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden.  2.=09Fiscal Stimulus Outlook By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus m= easures totaling somewhere between $100 and $180 billion, if you count the = $55 billion in airplane and reconstruction/defense spending already passed.= =20 Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that tax-cutting gets preferen= ce over spending, but that there will have to be some direct spending to an= esthetize the center-left crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves=  are beginning to go raw over corporate ""bailouts"" that have not yet includ= ed anything directly for the employees. So for now, here is a brief list of=  the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospec= ts: ?=09Payroll tax cut/suspension -- This has emerged as the most likely item = to be on any final list agreed to. As a stimulus item the economics are pro= bably better on this than almost anything else, since it puts money directl= y in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it = can be implemented very quickly.

There are a few problems with lower marginal co= rporate tax rates that have emerged.

Even more disturbing is th= at companies with large tax-loss carryforwards sitting on the books as asse= ts would take a massive hit on the value of these assets, since the calcula= ted benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once. For some weakened = companies this alone could be fatal, since their attractiveness to acquirer= s depends on their loss-carry forwards. Finally, many employee expenses tha= t companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and = the value of those deductions would obviously drop.=20 ?=09Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules -- The vas= t assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by t= he same problem: just talking about them gives businesses another reason to=  delay making investments.

There is no w= ay to propose these without delaying investment. On the plus side, the acce= lerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation, and can be done=  for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC= . Also, given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward, ther= e may be less concern about the investment postponement issue.

This is going to be the hardest to handi= cap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on p= ersonal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to=  make a macro difference. Cumulatively, though, these could easily top $10 = billion before the special pleading is done.

"Grigs,  I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will ""water out"" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

Production ""moderation"" of roughly 50 MMcf/d, or about 6.0% of the company's current total North American natural gas production, commenced in September and is expected to continue through at least November.  On the drilling side, the company is currently operating 40 rigs versus a peak of 51 this past summer and expects to end the year with around 35 rigs operating.  Nonetheless, the company is maintaining its $800-900 million capital program for the full-year, although actual spending is now expected to come in toward the lower end of this range. Importantly, EOG management stated that prior to production ""moderation"" and reduced drilling, the company was on course to achieve its previously stated North American production growth target of 4.0%.  With regard to 2002, management is still optimistic that it can achieve a 4.0% production growth next year if composite spot natural gas prices average at our current forecast of $2.25/MMBtu.""  << File: gasdaily.10.04.2001.pdf >> ",john.lavorato@enron.com,mike.grigsby@enron.com,RE: Shut in comments and EOG....,2001-10-04 07:03:07-07:00,sent

Now, as winter approaches, industry watchers wonder if the State has enough of the clean-burning fuel for the upcoming heating season, even as new gas-fired electricity generators come on line.  The Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report , adopted today by a 4-to-0 vote of the California Energy Commission, gives a qualified ""yes"" to the question of adequate supplies this winter. It identifies sufficient storage as a critical factor, and notes that utilities have substantially increased natural gas storage, largely because conservation and efficiency have dampened summer electricity demand.  Nearly 85 percent of the natural gas used by Californians comes by pipeline from gas fields located outside the State. Since California typically uses more natural gas in the winter than interstate pipelines can provide, additional supplies must be set aside in summer months to help balance supply and demand. For this reason, the report recommends that the Energy Commission continuously assess storage levels and monitor infrastructure improvements throughout the year.  The newly adopted report points out that California's natural gas supply system was designed years ago to provide enough gas for winter's peak heating demand. An increasing reliance on natural gas for generating electricity, however, has strained the system and revised old patterns of consumption.  ""This report helps Californians understand what we have to do to assure that we have a reliable and reasonably priced electricity and natural gas system in the future,"" said Energy Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore, Presiding Member of the Electricity and Natural Gas Committee that developed the document.  To help resolve possible supply problems, the document analyzes not only natural gas storage requirements but the interstate pipelines that bring the fuel from distant gas fields to the California border. These pipelines can deliver slightly more natural gas than intra-state gas pipelines ? those within our State's borders ? can receive. As a result, there are bottlenecks in getting some supplies to gas consumers that the report says must be improved.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) are improving and expanding their intra-state pipeline systems to help eliminate these constraints. According to the report, planned expansions of the interstate pipeline network should increase natural gas delivery to the State beginning next year, and additional improvements to the natural gas system should help prevent higher-than-normal prices that plagued California last winter.  Natural gas supplies in North America appear to be sufficient to meet demand in California and the rest of the United States for the next 50 years. The report recommends that the Energy Commission continue to monitor drilling rig activity and production levels for the long-term outlook. It also suggests that the Energy Commission, along with the Public Utilities Commission, should find ways to encourage and increase the in-state supply of natural gas.

According to Tad, Cordillera has received bids from some ""small niche"" marketers for their San Juan production that were very attractive.  Per Tad, these local marketers enjoy some market advantage that allows them to overcome the large discount ($0.15) that Enron sees at the tailgate of the Ignacio Plant.  Tad referred to these marketers as a ""club"".  Therefore, Cordillera is not interested in Enron purchasing its San Juan production.    Tad has requested that Enron modify/limit its proposal to just the Mid-Continent gas.  Contrary to Tad's comments on Tuesday, Tad stated yesterday that our Mid-Continent bid was competitive and Enron was definitely in the running for the Mid-Continent gas.  On Tuesday, Tad said Enron's Mid-Continent price was a little low.  For what its worth, Tad stated that Cordillera's target area to grow its production is the Mid-Continent area.     Per our conversation, you said that the only way to improve Enron's Mid-Continent bid was to look at trying to sell the gas in the Mid-Continent area to some outside company.  Is this practical for the small volume that Cordillera controls?  Should Enron even look at selling wellhead gas to companies outside of Enron?  It appears that Enron may not be able to improve its proposal.  Linda,  I told Tad that we would target Friday to get a revised proposal to him.  We could have more time if we need it.

Subject: Competitive Analysis Update- US Attacks Afghanistan #2 Importance: High  Update below on ground campaign strategy & timing, as well as mounting pressures on Saudi and Pakistani governments. Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway.   There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYC--we are investigating and will update as soon as possible.  Call with questions.  RJ x39934   1. Afghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate  With a target list thinner than for Kosovo, results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited.   But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up, the next phase of search and destroy ground raids, carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces, could be imminent.   Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun.   All our indications are that the US will commit a light division (up to 10,000 troops) and the UK a brigade (about 3,500).   This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised.  More stories along this line may become public over the weekend, even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action.  Word from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides, joining the Taleban against the foreign invader.   But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way.   There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out.  And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives - which they have been so far - the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited.  When the ground assault starts, from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan, the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air.   Such action will be fast and high risk, without much media coverage (with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen).   If the Taleban can be thus loosened, special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda, led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi.  Depending on how long this takes, there is hope among allied planners that ""reasonable elements"" in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broad-based coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision.   The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer.  2. Saudis Feeling Increased Pressure  Refusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom.   The tally of small, isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount.   We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaeda's coffers are now being 'advised' to do so, on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Laden's future displeasure.  Washington and London say the motivation for Abdullah's decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake.  The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see.   Blair was particularly galled by Abdullah's blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone, particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement.  3. Pakistan Holding Steady- For Now  Popular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage.   Even in Peshawar we are told that 'playing to the cameras' has become a distinct element of the protest.   Musharraf meanwhile, having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees, maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks.  Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation - just.  4. Key Issue for U.S. and Arab allies- Wider War?  There is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching.   This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan, but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan, the Gulf including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy.   Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it.   As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan, the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable.   But if it were to spill over, there could be difficulties for these regimes.

"Mike,  Following is a west fundies update.  We have not yet produced an abundance of finished product, but several great projects are in the development stage.  These projects are making nice progress even though it may not be visible to the casual observer.  PRODUCTION  This effort is being led by Tori and supported by both Jay and myself.  Gaskill's staff will be providing most of the manpower.  The concept is to design a model which takes a methodical and scientific approach in forecasting: (1) declines of existing production,  (2) increases due to drilling.   Existing production  Using externally provided production data, we are in the process of dividing production into zones of like characteristics.  Each zone will be identified by: Basin --> Reservoir --> Formation.  Analysis will be done at the zone level to determine its unique depletion curve.  This curve will be extrapolated to forecast future production from existing wells.  New production  From rig count data (or completion data if we buy the more expensive database) we can determine which ""zone"" a new well is targeting.  Forecasted production can then be determined by applying a recent historical success ratio and the corresponding depletion curve identified in the preceding step.  The difficult component to forecast with great accuracy is future drilling.  Our current thinking is a calculation that considers forward prices, drilling costs (which are increasing since all the ""easy wells"" have already been drilled), and common required rates of return.  Unresolved  Determining the specific plants which will be affected by depletions and new drilling is an unresolved issue.  The reciepient plant for new drilling may be identified in public records or we may be able to use rig coordinates to determine the closest and most likely plant.  Depletions may be more difficult as I am unsure if the well data can be readily cross-referenced with the corresponding plants.  DEMAND  This effort is being led by Mat Smith and supported by Jason Huang and myself.  Our near-term goals are to refine the existing California model and to develop similar models for the PNW, DSW, and RM.  Jason Wolfe is facilitating data collection and interpretation for the PNW.  I will likely recruit Billianna to follow suit in the DSW.  Jason Huang is moving to Gaskill's group, however, he will still have some involvement in this project.  I still intend on recruiting an individual from the research group, but feel that it is best to have the other regions ""framed"" (ie: model built) prior to bringing that person aboard.  His role will be to refine our technique and mathematics.  Data collection and interpretation  Much of the needed data is already in place, however some work remains.  Our existing NWPL histories consist of a handfull of compressor flows; demand is calculated by subtracting the downstream flow from the upstream flow.  This ""rough""  method works, but the downsides are: (1) this calculated number includes changes in line pack and therfore true demand is hidden; (2) we are forced to break NWPL into arbitrary regions determined by the placement of compressors.  Jason W. is working on collecting flows at every meter on the pipe.  This will afford a much more accurate reading of true demand devoid of linepack changes and significantly better regression analysis will result.  Jason is also looking at a more meaningful way of dividing the pipe into demand zones.  El Paso's system does not provide flows at individual meters, but we have recently discovered that several years of actual flows for pre-determined zones are available.  (Phoenix area, Tucson area, and El Paso City area).  Monique was working on uploading this data into our database.  I think Bilianna can pick up where Monique left off.  An ongoing process will be to drill into the various demand zones to gain a better understanding of specific drivers of that demand.  ie: weather sensitive load, industrial load and related economic factors, etc...  PNW, DSW, and RM regression analsysis  Two hurdles have prevented us from moving forward on this front.  First, the data collection discussed above-- this process should be complete within two weeks.  Second, our intention is to use Portland's power demand forecasts as a variable in our gas demand models.  Mat Smith needs to visit Portland to gain a comprehensive understanding of these load forecasts.  He has a trip scheduled for the end of October.  Provided things go according to plan, we should have ""rough"" models in place by mid-November.  At that time I will look to bring a research person aboard.",mike.grigsby@enron.com,keith.holst@enron.com,West Fundies,2001-10-13 09:01:36-07:00,received

However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.      I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.   Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.     We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.     Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.

Subject: Booking New Deals  Mike and Jeff:  I would like to review our existing new deal procedures, and outline the additions I have made to our process in light of the error we found last week.  I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the existing procedures used by Risk to check our new deal entry every night.  I agree that the process must be enhanced because it leaves some room for errors because each Risk person is responsible for checking his or her own inputs.  The existing procedures do not have a backstop in place for catching volumetric errors. We will have an additional ""check"" in place if the traders and the Risk group arrive at the same net new deals positions from independent sources.  The following spreadsheet describes our existing process.  The only addition to the procedures is the last section on Deal Entry.  That section describes the new standardized Notebook and the deals to be entered by Risk.   << File: NewDeal Procudures.xls >>   The new procedures that are being put into place include the following:  1. All traders will use a standardized notebook for writing up their financial trades; 2. The traders will no longer be entering their own financial deals; 3. The traders will keep an electronic record of the volumes traded through the broker market that will then be consolidated with the EOL trades done.  This net position should tie out to the net position entered into the system by Risk.   Keith Holst has had a similar function in a model that he runs; However, we decided that not only is his model to elaborate and complicated to be disseminated to all of the traders, but also this section has not been working.  I am working with Keith to design a simple process that will serve our needs and can be easily adopted by all Traders and Book Administrators.

The weak U.S. stock market amid the growing anthrax scare pressured futures today. News that an IBP packing plant in Lexington, Nebraska, is closing due to present market conditions also pressured the futures. Prices did open stronger, but could not hold their gains.   December lean hogs closed up $0.15 today at $50.37. Short covering from perceived oversold conditions gave a slight lift to futures today, as did a more stable cash market today. Still, the bulls are sickly in this market. Recent heavy hog runs have bulls worried about burdensome near-term pork supplies.   GRAINS: December corn futures closed 1 cent higher at $2.07 3/4 today. The market was supported by firming  basis levels in the cash market and the rally in wheat. Prices scored an ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart today. If there is follow-through buying interest on Thursday, a bullish key reversal will be confirmed.   November soybeans closed 3 1/2 cents higher at $4.34 today. The rally in wheat and rumored Chinese soybean demand supported beans today. Prices scored an ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart today. If there is follow-through buying on Thursday, a bullish key reversal up will be confirmed. Let's see what the weekly USDA export sales data shows Thursday morning.   December Chicago SRW wheat closed up 7 cents at $2.84 3/4 today. It was a big day for the bulls. Prices were boosted by more short covering, as well as hopes for near-term fresh export demand. Prices pushed to a fresh seven-week high today and closed near the session high.   SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 1 point higher at 6.63 cents today. Prices today pushed to a fresh two-week high, but then backed off and closed near the session low. The bulls have seen a nice mini run since the lows scored a little over a week ago.   December N.Y. coffee closed 85 points higher at 44.75 cents today. Prices gapped higher on the daily bar chart on some short covering after prices set a contract low Tuesday. Bulls should not get too excited about today's gap-higher trade. Let's see what price action does Thursday and Friday. Nearby coffee futures prices this week set a record low.   December N.Y. cocoa closed $27 higher today, at $1,066. Prices today showed good follow-through buying strength  and a bullish key reversal up was confirmed on the daily  bar chart. Bulls are gaining momentum.   December cotton closed 6 points higher at 31.53 cents in quiet trading today. I do look for some more short covering in the coming sessions, but make no mistake: bears  are in command. For a longer-term perspective, nearby New York cotton futures sunk to a low of 29.50 cents in 1986.   November orange juice on Tuesday afternoon closed at 86.10. That's off 1.30 cents from the Monday evening close. Prices are due for some corrective consolidation after the recent big gains. Last week's USDA Florida orange figure was termed bullish.   METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed up $1.10 today at $284.00 an ounce. It was another quiet day today. Bulls are trying to stabilize the market after last week's sell off. Bulls need to show more strength this week as bears have gained momentum.   December silver futures closed $0.015 higher at $4.37 an ounce today. Prices hit a fresh four-week low Tuesday as bears still have the near-term edge. Silver has also suffered technical damage recently.   December N.Y. copper closed 50 points lower at 63.90 cents. Prices today did not show the follow-through buying to confirm a key reversal up. Prices need to push above 66 cents and see a couple closes above that level before the bulls get much confidence.   ENERGIES: December crude closed off $0.16 at $22.10 today. Prices dropped to a fresh four-week low today. Bears are gaining momentum. A big bear flag continues to form on the daily chart. If there is a downside breakout from this big bear flag, the measuring implications point to possible losses to well below $20.00 per barrel.   December heating oil closed off 53 points, at .6290 today. Prices hit another fresh four-week low today. Bears remain in control as it looks like a big bear flag is forming on the daily bar chart. Measuring implications from this potential bear flag point to much larger losses.   December unleaded gasoline closed 99 points lower at .5863 today. Prices scored a fresh yearly low today, as bears gain even more momentum. Expect more volatility in the coming weeks.   December natural gas closed $0.0149 lower at $2.703 today. Prices pushed to another fresh five-week high today but then closed near the session low. Bulls have gained just a bit of momentum, but bears have the overall advantage.  STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 47 points lower today at .9010. Today's close was the lowest closing price in over a month. Bears are  gaining confidence. Prices are presently trading below a five-week-old downtrend line drawn off the September and October highs.   The December Japanese yen closed up 6 points at .8283 today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month low just Tuesday. Bears have control of the yen. A steep four- week-old downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart.   The December Swiss franc closed 19 points lower at .6101 today. While a steep four-week-old downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart, a longer-term 3.5-month-old uptrend line on the daily bar chart remains intact.   The December Canadian dollar closed 25 points lower at .6363 today. Prices again closed near the session low. Bulls need to step up the rest of this week or they will lose the slight momentum they have recently gained. Prices are still in a three-month-old downtrend on the daily bar chart.   The December British pound closed 6 points lower at 1.4424. It was another quiet day today. Bears have the slight edge. Technical damage has been inflicted recently.  First support is seen at the 1.4344 level. First resistance is now seen at 1.4500.   The September U.S. dollar index closed 56 points higher at 114.78 today. Bulls have made progress recently, but need  to keep the pressure on the bears. It appears a head-and- shoulders bottom reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart.   December U.S. T-bonds closed 17/32 higher at 106 23/32. Bulls are having a very good week, so far, and they needed it. Bulls can correctly argue this market was due for some corrective consolidation. The charts are still favoring the bulls.   December S&P 500 futures closed off 23.50 at 1076.00. Today, prices scored a bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar chart, and if there is follow-through selling on Thursday, a bearish key reversal down will be confirmed. Still, not much technical damage occurred today. Let's see what happens Thursday and Friday. This index has shown resilience, despite the gloomy U.S. economic conditions and terrorist threats. The growing anthrax  scare did spook traders today.

Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, h! ow! ever, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad! i! f at all possible.   Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Frank Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective.   Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&k! ey! =194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point.   Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the li! ne! up Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.   Sean Dawkins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige0! 1&! owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1230&>, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score.   Kyle Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable.! H! e won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1222&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy tea! m.! Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry <http://football222.fantas! y.! sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.  Jay Riemersma <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1662&>, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the year, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.  Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&! ra! ndom=3347&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.  Dedric Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Herald says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Sta! r, Smith could end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day.   Stephen Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Alexander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to the injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play.  Greg Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1798&>, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on his right hamstring three weeks ago. ""It was encouraging,"" Clark told the Contra Costa Times. ""I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of that before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison."" Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago.

The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Joey Galloway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1286&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/17/01 Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined.   Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1033&>, Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1757&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Peter Warrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=187401&>, Active WR Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.  Germane Crowell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12306&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available.   Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1265&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Johnson had his best game of the season, posting eight catches for 140 yards against Tennessee. He's a top-notch wideout Fantasy-wise, and deserves a weekly spot in your starting lineup.   Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=187503&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01 Canidate replaced the injured Marshall Faulk late in Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants. If Faulk's knee injury is serious, be sure to put in a waivers request for Canidate as soon as possible.   Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=133263&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01 Culpepper could have his best game of the season on Sunday against Detroit. He's far too valuable to ever place on reserve, so start him with confidence this week.   Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1152&>, Active RB Updated 10/11/01 Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice to allow a minor knee injury to heal. He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable.   Raiders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=21&>, Active DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   Deuce McAllister <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235228&>, Reserve RB Updated 09/02/01 McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. ""That was probably the best he's run the whole year,"" Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. ""I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do."" While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.  Mike Hollis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1387&>, Active K Updated 07/27/01 Despite being angry with Jacksonville management, Hollis reported to training camp on time. Hollis, who is having a contractual dispute with the team, boycotted June workouts and doesn't expect to be with the team next year. In any event, Hollis is still a solid kicker and will be one of the first ten placekickers taken in most Fantasy drafts.     <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/open_gif?splnid=6c9f5755f428de1a&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&email=081ea514660665d0486be3bd2d3ec7d3bf095a621938b58c&sport=football&vend=CBS%20SportsLine.com&product=mgmt&time=20011018&type=ereport&random=3347>   _____    Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Garcia is dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 against Chicago.   Peerless Price <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Grigsby Updated 10/18/01 Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacks! on! ville's secondary is thin because of injuries.  Eric Moulds <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.  Larry Centers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1072&>, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.  Drew Bledsoe <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leagu! e=! ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1041&>, QB NE - Top Dogs Updated 10/18/01 There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from ""out"" to ""doubtful"" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no timetable for his return.   Tyrone Wheatley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/18/01 Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an injured right knee. ""Tyrone Wheatley has a second degree - ! I ! don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,""' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks. ""I would not agree with that at this time,"" Gruden said.   Chris Weinke <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.  Brian Griese <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12409&>, QB DEN - TayDang Updated 10/18/01 Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and ! he! 's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar King. Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder.   Redskins <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1183&>, WR ARI - FJS Updated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised if his status is downgraded over the next two days.   Patrick Jeffers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1203&>, WR CAR - TayDang Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at al! l ! possible.   Chris Weinke <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Pink Panthers Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective.  Shawn Jefferson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   ! Troy Hambrick <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=194768&!>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point.   Michael Bennett <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Metz Updated 10/17/01 ! Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terrell Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Su! nd! ay at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1235&>, WR JAC - FJS Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.   Sean Dawkins <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&r! an! dom=2098&key=1230&>, WR JAC - The Rocks Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1032&>, QB JAC - FJS Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score.   Kyle Brady <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does pl! ay! . Brady only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1222&>, WR DET - Top Dogs Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team.! L! arry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Charlie Garner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Grigsby Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  More Updates <http://football210.fantasy.sp! or! tsline.com/mp/elink?script=pro-player-updates&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&start=30&>  Player News Teams     <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>   Grigsby Player News  Peerless Price <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=133393&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01 Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.  Charlie Garner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1149&>, Active RB Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  Joey Galloway <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/17/01 Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined.   Marshall Faulk <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1109&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throughout the week.   Tiki Barber <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1782&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks.   Germane Crowell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12306&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available.   Hines Ward <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12795&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01 Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38 yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,  Peyton Manning <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12531&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01 Manning should throw at least two TD passes against Oakland. The Raiders' secondary runs hot and cold, and sometimes has trouble with marquee quarterbacks.  Jaguars <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=13&>, Active DT Updated 09/23/01 Jacksonville's defense was solid once again, holding the Tennessee Titans to just six points on Sunday. They've allowed a total of nine points in their first two games of the season, and are worth picking up should they still be available in your league.   Chargers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=24&>, Reserve DT Updated 08/19/01 Defensive end Marcellus Wiley missed Saturday's game against the Miami Dolphins due to a sore hamstring. Defensive tackle Jamal Williams suffered a sprained knee in the game and could miss up to three weeks, and cornerback Alex Molden sustained a slight groin injury. None of these injuries are considered serious. San Diego made some improvements to their defensive unit during the offseason, and might be worth using when your starting defense has a bye week.   Carl Pickens <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1211&>, Active WR Updated 05/30/01 Weakened by a chronic hamstring problem that was showing no improvement over the offseason, Pickens has decided to retire after eight NFL seasons. Pickens, 31, signed a one-year, $500,000 contract earlier this spring with the Dallas Cowboys. But, after missing all of the minicamps and visiting with noted Birmingham, Ala., orthopedist James Andrews he decided to end his career.   Troy Aikman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1019&>, Reserve QB Updated 04/09/01 Aikman has decided to retire. Two sources close to Aikman said the 12-year veteran, released by the Cowboys last month, will officially announce his retirement at a Monday afternoon news conference.   Brett Conway <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1385&>, Active K Updated 12/22/00 Head Coach Al Groh won't make a decision until Sunday, but a source close to the Jets says that Groh is leaning towards using Conway for placekicking and Hall for kickoffs. Either way, Fantasy owners should avoid using either of the Jets' kickers in their final week of the season.     <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/open_gif?splnid=6c9f5755f428de1a&league=ee&owner=96876.9&email=7e42a28a21d85b828ac4d9d45fbd98b6927b929c31cf0865&sport=football&vend=CBS%20SportsLine.com&product=mgmt&time=20011018&type=ereport&random=2098>   _____    Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Prices closed near the session low on reported commercial selling, after briefly probing above $68.00 early in the session. Poor boxed beef movement today offset ideas that cash cattle prices might trade steady to firmer this week. There were early reports from Nebraska that quoted dressed beef prices 50 cents higher than last week.   December lean hogs closed up $0.10 today at $50.47. A firmer cash hog market today limited selling interest, as did lighter hog marketings the past couple days. Still, the bulls are on the ropes in this market.   GRAINS: December corn futures closed 2 3/4 cents lower at $2.05 today. Prices closed at the session low. Weekly export sales came in about as expected and the market continues to feel pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. There was no follow-through buying interest today, so a bullish key reversal was not confirmed.   November soybeans closed 3 1/4 cents lower at $4.30 3/4 today. Despite very solid weekly export sales figures for soybeans, meal and oil, reported early this morning, the markets could not rally on that news. This is an ominous sign for the bulls for at least the near term. There was no follow-through buying today, so a bullish key reversal up was not confirmed.   December Chicago SRW wheat closed off 1 3/4 cents at $2.83 today. Prices pushed to a fresh seven-week high today, but could not hold gains and closed near the session low. Still, bulls should not be too displeased by today's price action. The recent rally in Dec. wheat raises the possibility of a double-bottom reversal pattern developing on the daily bar chart. This morning's weekly export sales figures came in about as expected and were not market-moving. First resistance is now seen at $2.88. First support lies at the $2.80 area.  SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 7 points lower at 6.56 cents today. Prices took a ""rest day"" today after pushing to a fresh two-week high Wednesday. The bulls have seen a nice mini run since the lows scored a little over a week ago. But overall, bears still have a technical edge.   December N.Y. coffee closed 85 points higher at 45.60 cents today. Prices pushed to a high of 47.50 before backing off and closing near the session low. This week's activity in coffee is a bit encouraging to the bulls. However, it's too early to make anything significant out of it. Any increase in volatility at these low price levels will favor the bullish camp.   December N.Y. cocoa closed $8 lower today, at $1,058. Prices took a ""rest day"" today after scoring a bullish key reversal up this week. Bulls are gaining momentum. If they can push prices back above the $1,086 level and fill the downside gap created on the daily bar chart a couple weeks ago, then bulls will be right back in the ball game.   December cotton closed 35 points lower at 31.18 cents in quiet trading again today. Solid USDA weekly export sales for cotton failed to lift the market. But I do look for some more short covering in the coming sessions, but make no mistake: bears are in command.   November orange juice on Wednesday afternoon closed at 85.85. That's off 25 points from the Tuesday evening close. Prices are due for some corrective consolidation after the recent big gains. Bulls have the edge. Last week's USDA Florida orange figure was termed bullish.   METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed off $4.20 today at $279.80 an ounce. More technical damage was done today as prices fell below the $280 level. Bears are poised to push prices on down to the $275 area in the near term.  December silver futures closed $0.107 lower at $4.263 an ounce today. Prices hit a fresh five-week low today as prices fell down into the upside gap area on the daily bar chart that was created in early September.   December N.Y. copper closed 70 points lower at 63.20 cents. Prices today dropped to a fresh contract low of 63.00 cents. Bulls' hopes of some ""basing"" activity the past couple weeks have been dashed. Prices need to push above 66 cents and see a couple closes above that level before the bulls get much confidence. Next support is seen at 63.00 cents--the contract low.   ENERGIES: December crude closed off $0.50 at $21.60 today. Prices dropped to another fresh four-week low today. A big bear flag continues to form on the daily chart. If there is a downside breakout from this big bear flag, which may be occurring right now, the measuring implications point to possible losses to well below $20.00 per barrel.   December heating oil closed off 128 points, at .6162 today. Prices today matched the September low and are poised for more losses. It looks like a big bear flag is forming on the daily bar chart, and this week may have been the downside breakout from that pattern.   December unleaded gasoline closed 126 points lower at .5737 today. Prices scored another fresh yearly low today. It looks like prices have broken out on the downside of a bearish pennant pattern on the daily bar chart this week.   December natural gas closed $0.117 higher at $2.82 today. The nat gas market is acting well, given the liquid energies continue to deteriorate. Prices pushed to a fresh five-week high Wednesday. Bulls have gained a bit of momentum, but bears have the overall advantage.   STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 13 points higher today at .9023. Bears have gained confidence recently. Prices are presently trading below a  five-week-old downtrend line drawn off the September and October highs.   The December Japanese yen closed up 7points at .8285 today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month low just Tuesday. Bears have control of the yen. A steep four- week-old downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart. Next support is seen at 8236 level and then the .8200 level. First resistance is seen at the .8350 area.   The December Swiss franc closed 17 points higher at .6118 today. While a steep four-week-old downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart, a longer-term 3.5-month-old uptrend line on the daily bar chart remains intact. The stage is set for bulls and bears to do battle this week.   The December Canadian dollar closed 35 points lower at .6328 today. Significant technical damage occurred in this currency today, as prices dropped sharply and are right back down close to the April and September lows.   The December British pound closed 14 points lower at 1.4410. It was another quiet day today. The recent collapse in volatility makes me suspect a bigger price move is on the horizon. Bears have the slight edge. Technical damage has been inflicted recently.   The September U.S. dollar index closed 4 points lower at 114.74 today. Bulls have made progress recently, but need to keep the pressure on the bears. It appears a head-and- shoulders bottom reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart.   December U.S. T-bonds closed 3/32 higher at 106 26/32. Bulls are having a very good week, so far, and they needed it. Bulls can correctly argue this market was due for some corrective consolidation. The charts are still favoring the bulls. However, very strong resistance located just above the 107 even area stopped another bull run in bonds recently.   December S&P 500 futures closed slightly lower today. Today there was follow-through selling and a bearish key reversal down was confirmed on the daily bar chart. Friday's price action, heading into the weekend, will be extra important for the index. The growing anthrax scare has spooked traders this week.

But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1334&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scri! pt! =players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1335&> , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in place o! f ! the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvin Harrison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&ow! ne! r=49699.10&random=892&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/18/01  Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week i! f ! the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   ! Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Upd! at! ed 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1320&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight en! d ! now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bi! ge! 01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=187503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 Canidate wil! l ! likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive! o! f the two backs.   Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/! mp! /elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1140&> , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1334&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=play! er! s&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=133320&>, RB IND - TexOK Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wayne <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second co! ns! ecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.  Marvin Harrison <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1231&>, WR IND - Metz Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=12531&>, QB IND - Grigsby Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=12576! &>, WR MIN - Metz Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1593&>, WR GB - The Rocks Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1254&>, WR NE - The Rocks Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might! h! ave another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.   Antowain Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1663&>, RB NE - Pink Panthers Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.  Laveranues Coles <http://football210! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - FJS Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1440&>, RB WAS - TexOK Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent ga! me! of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1310&>, WR WAS - McKay Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde <http://foo! tb! all210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1320&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=133310&>, WR STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1294&>, WR STL - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leagu! e=! ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=187503&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Canidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has su! st! ained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.   Chad Lewis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

Prices scored a quiet ""inside day"" on the daily bar  chart today, as traders squared positions ahead of this afternoon's USDA monthly cattle-on-feed report. That report, released after the close, showed placements at 79% in September, and that's a bullish figure.   December lean hogs closed off $0.42 today at $50.05. A weaker cash hog market today and talk of weaker cash prices early next week pressured the futures today. The late-week ""pause"" could be setting up the next leg down in the market.   GRAINS: December corn futures closed 1/4 cent higher at $2.05 1/2 today. Prices dropped to a fresh 3.5-month low today as the market continues to feel pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. My bias is that the door is still opened to a decline to the June low of around $2.03, or below.   November soybeans closed 6 1/4 cents lower at $4.24 3/4 today. Prices closed at the weekly low close today after very solid weekly export sales figures for soybeans, meal and oil could not rally the market Thursday. That was an ominous sign for the bulls for at least the near term.   December Chicago SRW wheat closed up 4 cents at $2.87 today. Bulls had an excellent week. Prices pushed to another fresh seven-week high today. The recent rally in Dec. wheat confirms a double-bottom reversal pattern on the daily bar chart.   SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 17 points higher at 6.73 cents today. Prices closed near the session high and at the weekly high close today--and hit a fresh three-week high today. That's positive for bulls heading into next week.   December N.Y. coffee closed 175 points lower at 43.85 cents today. The bears set a trap for the premature bulls this week, as prices sold right back off after the pop north on Thursday. Still, this week's activity in coffee is a bit encouraging to the bulls, as the increase in volatility at these low price levels favors the bullish camp.   December N.Y. cocoa closed $32 lower today, at $1,026. Prices gapped lower today and closed near the session low.  It was a volatile week this week, and bears won the battle--even though prices scored a bullish key reversal up this week.   December cotton closed 63 points lower at 30.55 cents today. Prices fell to a fresh contract low of 30.51 cents  today. For a longer-term perspective, nearby New York cotton futures sunk to a low of 29.50 cents in 1986.   November orange juice on Thursday afternoon closed at 86.95. That's up 110 points from the Wednesday evening close. Prices this week saw some corrective consolidation after the recent big gains. This ""pause"" is not at all bearish and bulls have the edge.   METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed up $0.90 today at $280.70 an ounce. Significant technical damage was done this week in gold. The daily chart favors the bears heading into next week.   December silver futures closed $0.01 higher at $4.273 an ounce today. Prices hit a fresh five-week low Thursday. Bears have the big edge. Silver has suffered technical damage recently.   December N.Y. copper closed 85 points lower at 62.35 cents. Prices today dropped to another fresh contract low of 62.25 cents. Next support is seen at 62.00 cents.  Next resistance is seen at 64 cents. Worries about demand in the face of the potential for consumer ""retrenchment"" have pressured the market.   ENERGIES: December crude closed up $0.71 at $22.66 today. Prices showed a corrective bounce in a bear market today.  Prices dropped to a four-week low just Thursday. A big bear flag still may be forming on the daily chart, but if there is more upside action next week, that flag will not play out and will be negated.   December heating oil closed up 178 points, at .6339 today. Prices scored a corrective bounce in a bear market today. Prices Thursday matched the September low. A big bear flag may still be forming on the daily bar chart, but more upside action next week will negate that formation.   December unleaded gasoline closed 248 points higher at .5985 today. Prices scored a corrective bounce in a bear market today. Prices scored a fresh yearly low just Thursday. A bearish pennant pattern on the daily bar chart still could be forming, but would be negated next week if there's more upside price action.   December natural gas closed $0.19 higher at $2.99 today. Prices today pushed to a six-week high and closed at the weekly high close. This bodes well for price action heading into next week. The nat gas market had been acting well, given the recent downturn in liquid energies.   STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 48 points lower today at .8975. Prices scored a fresh six-week low today and closed at the weekly low close. That's bearish heading into trading early next week.   The December Japanese yen closed off 5 points at .8280 today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month low just Tuesday. Bears have control of the yen. A steep four-week- old downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart.   The December Swiss franc closed 27 points lower at .6091 today. Bears won the battle this week as prices closed at the weekly low close. While a steep four-week-old downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart, a longer-term 3.5-month-old uptrend line on the daily bar chart remains intact--but just barely.   The December Canadian dollar closed 10 points higher at .6338 today. Prices scored a quiet ""inside day"" today, but significant technical damage occurred in this currency this week, as prices dropped sharply and are now back down close to the April and September lows.   The December British pound closed 120 points lower at 1.4304. Prices fell sharply today and closed at the weekly low close, as well as set a fresh five-week low. This is bearish heading into trading Monday.   The September U.S. dollar index closed 44 points higher at  115.18 today. Prices pushed to a fresh five-week high today and the bulls won the battle this week. It appears a head-and-shoulders bottom reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart.   December U.S. T-bonds closed 16/32 lower at 106 10/32. Prices today scored a big ""outside day"" down and the bears  get to go home for the weekend with some momentum. While bulls gained ground on the week, they could not push prices  above very strong resistance located just above the 107 even.   December S&P 500 futures closed off 0.60 at 1072.50. Bears won the battle this week with a bearish key reversal down on Wednesday. The growing anthrax scare spooked traders this week.

Copper futures, a leading indicator, sank close to fresh lows, and Debt futures ended weak.  However, while Stocks finished the week lower, they managed a Friday rebound, and the Dollar started to look stronger.  Bottom line though? Traders are still very nervous.  Crude Oil did a see-saw, rallying late on production cut hopes after sliding during the week, while Natural Gas advanced on the basis of a forecast that the coming winter would be cooler than the warm winters of the late 90's.  Huge supplies and great weather continued to depress Corn and Soybeans, while Wheat rebounded on firm cash and export hopes.  Sugar had a late surge, but Cocoa sold off ahead of new-crop shipments, Coffee fell back after a failed rally, and Cotton sank on ideal harvest conditions.  Hogs and Bellies closed on the weak side, Cattle mixed.    Alex McCallum, Editorial Director & Forum Moderator  P.S.

Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a major sco! ri! ng threat even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him.   Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01 Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week.   Doug Chapman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com! /m! p/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=187510&> , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   ! Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 10/21/01 ! Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) started Sun! da! y's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=235247! &>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit! . ! Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.!  Eddie George <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=235206&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1851&>, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not ca! pa! ble of providing owners with regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players=! ag! ue=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=187503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, p! os! ting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a major scoring thr! ea! t even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1191&>, WR KC - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him.   Trent Green <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1599&>, QB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week.   Doug Chapman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/el! in! k?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187510&> , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Tomaski Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Michael ! Pi! ttman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235249&>, RB SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12409&>, QB DEN - TayDang Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) started Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.c! om! /mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187401&> , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 ! ya! rds against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.   Anthony Thomas <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.  Charlie Batch <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.! co! m/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12204&> , QB DET - Pink Panthers Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1069&>, QB TEN - McKay Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.  Eddie George <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Fear! Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235206&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick ! ti! ght end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1851&>, WR NO - FJS Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1234&>, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4! 09! 4&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Grigsby Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1171&>, RB TB - TexOK Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St.! L! ouis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1265&>, WR TB - The Rocks Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jerome Bettis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1152&>, RB PIT - The Rocks Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate <http://football210.fantasy.spo! rt! sline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187503&> , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.      I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.   Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.     We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.     Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.   I have a question.  What does the ""Wood"" report mean ?     See you.

How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.   Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?   Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies.    By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early.    Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.

They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.  On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.  We have not rebooked the origination.

Prices dropped to another fresh 3.5-month low today as the market continues to feel pressure from harvest and uninspired demand.   January soybeans closed 2 1/2 cents lower at $4.27 today. Prices hit a contract low in the January contract today. We had more positive news on the export front today, in the form of weekly export inspections being well above expectations. But still, the market could not rally on that friendly news.   December Chicago SRW wheat closed off 5 cents at $2.82 today. Prices were due for a corrective pullback this week after they pushed to a fresh seven-week high on Friday. Profit taking was featured today amid weak weekly export inspections figures.   SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 9 points lower at 6.64 cents today. Prices closed near the session low, but did hit a fresh three-week high today. Bulls are still gaining confidence, but bears still have the technical edge, overall.   December N.Y. coffee closed 135 points lower at 42.50 cents today. Prices set a contract and record low for nearby futures today. There is no doubt the bears are in full command of coffee at present. The only encouraging news to the bulls is the increase in volatility at these lower price levels.   December N.Y. cocoa closed $23 lower today, at $1,003. Prices again gapped lower today and scored a new low for the month, and that's just another bearish clue. A new downtrend line has developed on the daily bar chart and bears are in command.   December cotton closed 74 points lower at 29.81 cents today. Reports said a big ""fund"" sell order hit the market  to drive prices sharply lower. Prices gapped down to a fresh contract low of 29.60 cents today. That's close to the key 29.50-cent level.   January orange juice on Friday afternoon closed at 89.20. That's up 35 points from the Thursday evening close. Prices  scored a bullish ""outside day"" up on Friday and are now very close to the recent high. The bulls still have the edge.   METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed off $4.20 today at $276.50 an ounce. More technical damage was done today in gold. Bears are poised to push prices on down to the $275 area in the near term, or below.   December silver futures closed $0.038 lower at $4.235 an ounce today. Prices hit another fresh five-week low Thursday, and have almost filled the big upside gap on the daily bar chart that was created in early September.   December N.Y. copper closed 15 points higher at 62.50 cents. Prices today dropped to another fresh contract low of 62.00 cents. Bears rule.   ENERGIES: December crude closed unchanged at $22.26 today. Prices scored a quiet ""inside day"" on the daily bar chart. Prices dropped to a four-week low just last Thursday. A big bear flag still may be forming on the daily chart.  December heating oil closed 14 points lower, at .6325 today. Prices scored a quiet ""inside day"" on the daily bar chart today. Prices last Thursday matched the September low. A big bear flag may still be forming on the daily bar chart.  December unleaded gasoline closed 27 points higher at .6012 today. Prices scored a fresh yearly low just last  Thursday. A bearish pennant pattern on the daily bar chart still could be forming.  December natural gas closed $0.085 higher at $3.075 today. Prices today pushed to another six-week high and closed near the session high. Again, the nat gas market had been acting well, given the recent downturn in liquid energies.  STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 73 points lower today at .8907. Prices scored another fresh six-week low today. Bears are gaining more confidence by the day.   The December Japanese yen closed off 94 points at .8191 today. Prices pushed to a fresh 2.5-month low today. Bears have control of the yen.   The December Swiss franc closed 60 points lower at .6036 today. A steep four-week-old downtrend line remains in place on the daily bar chart. Importantly, today a longer-term 3.5-month-old uptrend line on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the downside and negated.   The December Canadian dollar closed 9 points lower at .6329 today. Significant technical damage has occurred in this currency recently. Prices are now back down close to the April and September lows.   The December British pound closed 98 points lower at 1.4202. Prices fell to a fresh 2.5-month low today. Bears have the edge. Technical damage has been inflicted recently. First support is now seen at the 1.4100 level. First resistance is now seen at 1.4300.   The September U.S. dollar index closed 92 points higher at 116.10 today. Prices pushed to another fresh five-week high today and the bulls are really gaining strength. It appears a head-and-shoulders bottom reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart.   December U.S. T-bonds closed 4/32 higher at 106 13/32. The market took a ""rest day"" today, after the recent active price action. Recently, bull could not push prices above very strong resistance located just above the 107 even. That gives the bears confidence.   December S&P 500 futures closed up 20.70 at 1093.20. Prices closed near the session high. Importantly today, prices were not negatively impacted by the news that two postal workers in Washington, D.C. have died from likely inhalation anthrax exposure. Many would have thought that would have spooked the stock market. If prices can push above last week's high of 1114.50, that would be a very positive development for the bulls.

"Dear West,  We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.    We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.    Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Thanks, Mike  -----Original Message----- From: Bike, Anne  Sent: Wednesday, October 03, 2001 7:25 AM To: Grigsby, Mike Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads   I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.     I will keep you posted.   Thanks   Anne    -----Original Message----- From: Grigsby, Mike  Sent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 1:54 PM To: Bike, Anne Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads   How is this issue?  -----Original Message----- From: Bike, Anne  Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 7:15 PM To: Grigsby, Mike Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads   I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.      I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.   Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.     We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.     Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.   I have a question.  What does the ""Wood"" report mean ?     See you.   Anne                    -----Original Message----- From: Grigsby, Mike  Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 8:51 PM To: Bike, Anne Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads   Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.   Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?   Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies.    By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early.    Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?      -----Original Message-----  From: Bike, Anne  Sent: Tue 9/18/2001 3:56 PM  To: Grigsby, Mike  Cc:  Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads    Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.  On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.  We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.  Let me know if this clears everything up.

"Mike, Check out article in today's electric power daily.  DWR is having problems with bond issue and has yet to forward hedge gas exposure. Frank   Also in the new filing, DWR lowered its estimate for revenue from off-system power sales to $191-million from $477-million. Nichols said the change reflected similar volume, but less return given falling power prices. He said he could not estimate exactly how much power the agency will sell on the market. Nichols added that DWR has yet to enter into natural gas hedges to lower some contract prices, because the agency is unsure it has the legal right to do so.",mike.grigsby@enron.com,frank.hayden@enron.com,Electric Power Daily,2001-10-23 04:56:34-07:00,received

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock  540 mmcf/d Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d Needles 800 mmcf/d Wheeler 800 mmcf/d  New Receipt Points Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d Both will be available around Feb 1  Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.  New Calculation, Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.  OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select  Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.    Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.   Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.  Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.      Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.  2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free. OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.    Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.   Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage. No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO. Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal. Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.   If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules. Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.   If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:  Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.   For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.  For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:           Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2 Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1 Cycle 3    evening cyle 2 on 10/4 Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4  In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.  Winter Balancing Rules Effective Nov 1-March 31 No changes. All customers must comply. Minimum delivery requirements 50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;) 70% of daily usage depending on storage level 70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min 90% of daily usage depending on storage level 90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min. Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect. Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule. Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,  Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.  Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.   Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group) Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.  2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.  Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement, Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.  Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.   OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)            ",m..tholt@enron.com,mike.grigsby@enron.com,RE: Socal Window Meeting,2001-10-23 05:27:59-07:00,sent
"Mike:   It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways.  Those alternatives are as follows:    1.  We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount.    2.  If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the       amount we are paying them.  Of course, we would need to provide them some        sort of explanation.   My preference at this time would be to do the first item.  If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.  If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item.   I trust all is well with you.  I look forward to hearing from you.

""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week.""

""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.   Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&k! ey! =187503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.   J.J. Stokes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was a! bl! e to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' starting lineup within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/! 0! 1 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.   Anthony Wright <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free Age! nt! Updated 10/23/01 Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper leagues.   David Terrell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 ! Terrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third receiver.   Tony Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Rob Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season! g! ame this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go.   Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leag! ue! =bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.  Jacquez Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week! S! even.  Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy! t! old the St. Petersburg Times . ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.  Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 10/22/01 Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help.""  James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1116&>, RB DET ! -! Hunter Updated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren finished the game in his absence.

"Thank you for the update.  Mike Grigsby   -----Original Message----- From:  Hyde, Chris   Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 2:15 PM To: Pena, Matt; Shim, Elizabeth Cc: Dronet, David; Grigsby, Mike Subject: Pipeline Cutoffs  Just an update, to keep everyone current on the progress of this initiative:  We (Matt (from Unify), Liz, Dave, and myself) met today and attempted to find ways to directly relate the Passport information (from El Paso) to the corresponding prices etc. in Unify.  Unfortunately, we discovered that there is no direct ""fool-proof"" way to accomplish this.  However, we have come up with a couple of things to try:  Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other information they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifies each deal / cut.  Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating the data to Unify much easier. Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the ""scheduled quantity"" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub.  It's possible that this file contains cut information itself, which would possibly alleviate the need to use the Passport file altogether.  I believe that succinctly recaps the results of our meeting today.  If I have misrepresented anything, please let me know.  Also, feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.

Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by! r! ookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.

Eddie George <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1069&>, QB TEN - McKay Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scrip! t=! players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.   Dennis Northcutt <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap  <http://football210.fan! ta! sy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1035&>, QB BAL - TexOK Updat! ed! 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.   Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=12411&>, WR STL - Metz Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   T! ru! ng Canidate <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=187503&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.   J.J. Stokes <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1292&>, WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was a! bl! e to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Pink Panthers Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1109&>, RB STL - Grigsby Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.   Anthony Wright <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper leagues.   David Terrell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Terrell ! wi! ll not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third receiver.   Tony Martin <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1282&>, WR ATL - TexOK Updated 10/23/01 Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Rob Moore <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1183&>, WR ARI - FJS Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season game this season.! M! oore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go.   Tiki Barber <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Grigsby Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&ow! ne! r=96876.9&random=2792&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.  Jacquez Green <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seve! n.!   Keyshawn Johnson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1265&>, WR TB - The Rocks Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1171&>, RB TB - TexOK Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the! St. Petersburg Times . ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.

We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount.    2.  If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the       amount we are paying them.  Of course, we would need to provide them some        sort of explanation.   My preference at this time would be to do the first item.  If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! .  Trent Dilfer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige0! 1&! owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1389&>, K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/el! in! k?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.   Dennis Northcutt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap <http://football222! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.   Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key! =1! 87503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.   J.J. Stokes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

All of our new people are starting this week and next week but it takes a while to get them into the weekend rotation.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.  Trent Dilfer <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantas! y ! perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&! ra! ndom=73&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12612&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He wi! ll! work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1171&>, RB TB - TexOK Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1757&>, RB PHI - TayDang Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in the ga! me! . At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1389&>, K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Pink Panthers Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1069&>, QB TEN - McKay Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=pl! ay! ers&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.   Dennis Northcutt <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap <http://football210.fanta! sy! .sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=235215&> , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1035&>, QB BAL - TexOK Updated 10/23! /0! 1 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.   Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12411&>, WR STL - Metz Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung! C! anidate <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187503&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.   J.J. Stokes <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1292&>, WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was able to get treatment every day,""! S! tokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Pink Panthers Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1109&>, RB STL - Grigsby Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.   Amani Toomer  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/24/01  According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.   Wayne Chrebet  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/24/01  Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.   Chris Sanders  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.   Bert Emanuel  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1186&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.   Hines Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/24/01  Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.   Germane Crowell  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12306&>, WR DET - Giggles Updated 10/24/01  The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.   Santana Moss  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.   Brett Favre  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 10/24/01  Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.   Marvin Minnis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts.   Larry Foster  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.   Marcus Robinson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1676&>, WR CHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01  The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.   Neil Rackers  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.   Todd Pinkston  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01  Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.   Ron Dixon  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.   Joe Jurevicius  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines.   Reggie Swinton  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.   Joey Galloway  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Giggles Updated 10/24/01  Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.   Darrin Chiaverini  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=133247&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.   Raghib Ismail  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.   Ricky Watters  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.   Trent Dilfer  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.   Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01  Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.   Wayne Chrebet  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01  The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.   Dedric Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.   Lamar Smith  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01  Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.   Marvin Minnis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.   Jerome Pathon  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 10/23/01  Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.   Terrence Wilkins  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.   Terrell Davis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01  Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   More Updates <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=pro-player-updates&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&start=30&>  Player News Teams      <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>   Giggles Player News   Germane Crowell  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12306&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01  The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.  Joey Galloway  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01  Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.   Duce Staley  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1757&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/23/01  Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Trung Canidate  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187503&>, Active RB Updated 10/23/01  According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.   Keyshawn Johnson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1265&>, Active WR Updated 10/22/01  Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.  Jerome Bettis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1152&>, Active RB Updated 10/21/01  Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Peter Warrick  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187401&>, Active WR Updated 10/21/01  Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Daunte Culpepper  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=133263&>, Active QB Updated 10/19/01  Green Bay's defense has played well so far, but Culpepper won't be intimidated by the Packers. He has faced them many times before, and should fare well in an important divisional game in front of the home crowd.  Tyrone Wheatley  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1140&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/18/01  The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Rob Johnson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1033&>, Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01  Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Raiders  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=21&>, Active DT Updated 10/02/01  The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   Deuce McAllister  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235228&>, Reserve RB Updated 09/02/01  McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. ""That was probably the best he's run the whole year,"" Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. ""I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do."" While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.  Mike Hollis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1387&>, Active K Updated 07/27/01  Despite being angry with Jacksonville management, Hollis reported to training camp on time. Hollis, who is having a contractual dispute with the team, boycotted June workouts and doesn't expect to be with the team next year. In any event, Hollis is still a solid kicker and will be one of the first ten placekickers taken in most Fantasy drafts.     <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/open_gif?splnid=6c9f5755f428de1a&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&email=081ea514660665d0486be3bd2d3ec7d3bf095a621938b58c&sport=football&vend=CBS%20SportsLine.com&product=mgmt&time=20011025&type=ereport&random=2616>   _____    Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

""He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"" coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,"" Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again.   James Stewart  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/25/01  Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain.   Wayne Chrebet  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/25/01  Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup.   Terrell Davis  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday.   Clint Stoerner  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season.   Anthony Wright  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet.   Terrell Davis  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.   Amani Toomer  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/24/01  According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.   Wayne Chrebet  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/24/01  Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.   Chris Sanders  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.   Bert Emanuel  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1186&>, WR NE - McKay Updated 10/24/01  Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.   Hines Ward  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Grigsby Updated 10/24/01  Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.   Germane Crowell  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12306&>, WR DET - Grigsby Updated 10/24/01  The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.   Santana Moss  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.   Brett Favre  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1028&>, QB GB - The Rocks Updated 10/24/01  Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.   Marvin Minnis  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts.   Larry Foster  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.   Marcus Robinson  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1676&>, WR CHI - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/24/01  The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.   Neil Rackers  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.   Todd Pinkston  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.   Ron Dixon  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.   Joe Jurevicius  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines.   Reggie Swinton  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.   Joey Galloway  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Grigsby Updated 10/24/01  Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.   Darrin Chiaverini  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=133247&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01  Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.   Raghib Ismail  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Pink Panthers Updated 10/24/01  Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.   Ricky Watters  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1151&>, RB SEA - McKay Updated 10/23/01  According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.   Trent Dilfer  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.   Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.   Wayne Chrebet  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/23/01  The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.   More Updates <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=pro-player-updates&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&start=30&>  Player News Teams      <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>   Grigsby Player News   Germane Crowell  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12306&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01  The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.  Hines Ward  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12795&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01  Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.  Joey Galloway  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01  Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.   Marshall Faulk  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1109&>, Active RB Updated 10/23/01  According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.   Tiki Barber  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1782&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01  Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.  Peyton Manning  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12531&>, Active QB Updated 10/18/01  Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Peerless Price  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=133393&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01  Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.  Charlie Garner  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1149&>, Active RB Updated 10/17/01  The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  Jaguars  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=13&>, Active DT Updated 09/23/01  Jacksonville's defense was solid once again, holding the Tennessee Titans to just six points on Sunday. They've allowed a total of nine points in their first two games of the season, and are worth picking up should they still be available in your league.   Chargers  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=24&>, Reserve DT Updated 08/19/01  Defensive end Marcellus Wiley missed Saturday's game against the Miami Dolphins due to a sore hamstring. Defensive tackle Jamal Williams suffered a sprained knee in the game and could miss up to three weeks, and cornerback Alex Molden sustained a slight groin injury. None of these injuries are considered serious. San Diego made some improvements to their defensive unit during the offseason, and might be worth using when your starting defense has a bye week.   Carl Pickens  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1211&>, Active WR Updated 05/30/01  Weakened by a chronic hamstring problem that was showing no improvement over the offseason, Pickens has decided to retire after eight NFL seasons. Pickens, 31, signed a one-year, $500,000 contract earlier this spring with the Dallas Cowboys. But, after missing all of the minicamps and visiting with noted Birmingham, Ala., orthopedist James Andrews he decided to end his career.   Troy Aikman  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1019&>, Reserve QB Updated 04/09/01  Aikman has decided to retire. Two sources close to Aikman said the 12-year veteran, released by the Cowboys last month, will officially announce his retirement at a Monday afternoon news conference.   Brett Conway  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1385&>, Active K Updated 12/22/00  Head Coach Al Groh won't make a decision until Sunday, but a source close to the Jets says that Groh is leaning towards using Conway for placekicking and Hall for kickoffs. Either way, Fantasy owners should avoid using either of the Jets' kickers in their final week of the season.     <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/open_gif?splnid=6c9f5755f428de1a&league=ee&owner=96876.9&email=7e42a28a21d85b828ac4d9d45fbd98b6927b929c31cf0865&sport=football&vend=CBS%20SportsLine.com&product=mgmt&time=20011025&type=ereport&random=4517>   _____    Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.   Tyrone Wheatley  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/25/01  Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making progress.

Jeffers, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been told by the coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first time this season. ""They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing like I will be,"" Jeffers said. ""I'm excited. It's another step along the way."" Keep Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited action if plays.   Ryan Leaf  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01  Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has been named the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright.   Clint Stoerner  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01  Stoerner will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who is out with a chronic sprained knee and could face season-ending surgery. We wouldn't advise using Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. He has played just three games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2 quarterback for Dallas.   Edgerrin James  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=133320&>, RB IND - TexOK Updated 10/26/01  James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine for the Colts' next game on November 4.   Derrick Alexander  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=1191&>, WR KC - Top Dogs Updated 10/25/01  Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets.   James Hodgins  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=146331&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy.   Dave Stachelski  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=187759&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards.   Michael Bennett  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week.   Todd Heap  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week.   Anthony Thomas  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report.   Kevin Swayne  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=1677&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week.   Reggie Swinton  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy.   Dedric Ward  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle.

Nevertheless, this week's rally to new highs for October keeps the fall rally intact and sets the stage for a possible test of fib resistance crossing at 1857.56 later this fall. The December S&P 500 index also closed slightly lower in quiet trading on Friday leaving Thursday's key reversal up unconfirmed. Session highs fell just short of testing last week's high at 1114.50 before profit taking pressured the market into the close. If the rally continues, the 50% retracement level of the May/September decline crossing at 1137.45 is December's next upside target.   The Dow closed higher on Friday thereby confirming yesterday's key reversal up. Session highs fell short of testing broken fib support crossing at 9636. The new high close for the month keeps this fall's rebound alive while setting the stage for a possible test of this summer's downtrend line, which crosses near 9905 later this fall.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  December bonds posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday. Early weakness led to a jab below broken resistance crossing at 107-11. However, a lack of follow-through selling failed to materialize, which triggered a short covering rally into the close. Friday's new contract high close sets the stage for additional gains into early- November and a possible test of the October 1998 high, which crosses at 111-21 later this year. This week's rally has turned the daily ADX bullish.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index closed slightly higher on Friday due strength in gold, fiber and some energy markets. The CRB is trying to carve out a bottom just above the July 1999 low crossing at 182.67. Closes above 191.99 are needed to confirm that a bottom has been posted. The daily ADX remains bearish but hints that this fall's decline may soon come to an end.  ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed mixed on Friday in quiet trading. Recent talk that OPEC will cut crude oil production by as much as 750,000 barrels on November 14th has put a floor under crude oil and the products for the time being.   December crude oil closed slightly higher on Friday as it posted an inside week. Closes above 22.80 or below 21.41 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Daily momentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold while weekly indicators are bearish and signal that new lows are still possible later this fall.   December heating oil closed lower on Friday in lackluster trading as it ended its fourth week of sideways trading. Closes above 68.60 or below 61.40 are needed to confirm a breakout of this fall's trading range and point the direction of the next trending move. Momentum indicators are neutral to bullish hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-November.  December unleaded gas closed lower on Friday confirming Thursday's downside reversal. Closes below 58.25 would set the stage for a possible test of last week's low crossing at 56.80. However, stochastics and RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible.  December Henry Hub natural closed higher on Friday as it extends this month's short covering rally and confirmed Wednesday's breakout above the April/August downtrend line. Friday's high-range close leaves the door open for additional strength on Monday as the seasonal trend points to higher prices into mid-winter. Stochastics and RSI are becoming overbought but signal that additional strength is still possible.  CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The December Dollar posted an inside day with a slightly higher close on Friday thereby leaving Thursday's key reversal down unconfirmed. December is at a crossroads having spiked above September's high, which coincides with the 50% retracement level of this summer's decline at 116.65. Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to keep this fall's rally alive. Closes below October's uptrend line and Thursday's low at 115.45 would all but confirm that a short-term top has been posted.   The December Swiss Franc posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on Friday leaving yesterday's key reversal up unconfirmed. December remains below broken trendline support crossing near .6082, which leaves the door open for additional weakness this fall if December can close below Tuesday's low at .5996. If the decline resumes, the 50% retracement level crossing at .5944 is December's next target.   The December Canadian Dollar posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday as it continues to consolidate above this week's low, which appears to have also marked a double bottom with the late-September low at .6315. Closes above .6367 would temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market and could set the stage for a possible test of October's high at .6422 later this fall.   The December Japanese Yen posted an inside day with a higher close due to light short covering on Friday. However, the rising ADX signals that additional weakness into the end of October is still possible. If the decline continues, the reaction low crossing at .8090 is a potential target later this fall.   PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  December gold closed higher on Friday as it extended its short covering bounce off this week's low. Friday's close above the 62% retracement level, which crosses at 278.10 has tempered the near-term bearish outlook in the market while opening the door for additional short covering into early- November. Stochastics and RSI are oversold and turning neutral hinting that a low is in or very near.   December silver closed slightly lower on Friday as it consolidates above September's gap crossing at 4.20. If this support level gives way, September's low at 4.175 is the next downside target. However, momentum indicators are very oversold hinting that a short-term bottom might be near. Closes above broken fib support crossing at 4.294 are needed before a bottom is confirmed.   December copper closed sharply higher on Friday due to short covering after failing to extend this week's decline below last Friday's low at 62.25. Today's close at broken long- term support crossing at 63.50 hints that additional short covering is possible. However, it will take closes above last week's high of 65.20 to signal that a bottom is in place. Momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral to bullish hinting that additional short covering is possible next week.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  December corn closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead of the weekend. Session highs tested the September/October downtrend line crossing near 2.07 but was unable to overcome this resistance level. Until this initial resistance level is broken, the door remains open for a possible test of this summer's low crossing at 2.02 1/4 this fall. With the bulk of this year's corn harvest still ahead of us along with the upcoming November supply/demand report, upside potential near-term appears limited.   December wheat closed above key resistance marked by August's high at 2.93 1/2 as it confirmed Thursday's key reversal up. This week's strong export sales report along with mounting concerns over flooding in Argentine wheat country continues to underpin this fall's rally. Multiple closes above August's high would confirm today's breakout thereby setting the stage for a test of the 50% retracement level of the January/September decline crossing at 2.97 possibly on Monday. Momentum indicators are bullish but becoming overbought while the daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) has turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices into early-November are possible.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  November soybeans posted an inside day on Friday due to light profit taking ahead of the weekend as it consolidated some of this week's gains. With soybean harvest rapidly coming to an end, downside risk appears limited at this time. Thursday's breakout above October's downtrend line signaled that a harvest low might be in place. Closes above the August/September downtrend line crossing near 4.36 are needed before this is confirmed. This week's downturn by the daily ADX provides added confirmation that an important low was posted earlier this week.   December soybean meal closed higher on Friday due to light short covering. Session highs fell short of filling this month's gap crossing at 163.90 before a sell off ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses. Friday's mid- range close leaves the door open for a possible setback on Monday as December may try and consolidate some of this week's gains. Longer-term, the door is open for a test of the top of the gap crossing at 163.90 then October's high crossing at 167.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  December hogs closed higher on Friday due to short covering ahead of the weekend as the market consolidated some of this week's losses. Additional pressure came from light position squaring ahead of this afternoon's monthly USDA hogs and pigs report. This afternoon's snout count showed the U.S. pig crop as of September was 8.56 million head, slightly below the previous year's level. Sow farrowing during this time frame totaled 964,000 head, 1% below last year. The average litter size for September rose to 8.88 compared with 8.84 last year. This afternoon's report had no surprises in it so traders will continue to focus on demand versus supply for near-term direction. Weekly momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are likely into November. The daily ADX is also bearish mode and rising, which signals that additional weakness is possible.  December cattle posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on Friday leaving Thursday's key reversal up unconfirmed. Gains were limited as cash bids continue to run at a discount to futures prices. Closes above the September/October downtrend line crossing near 67.50 are needed to confirm that a bottom has been posted. Stochastics and RSI are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early November.  FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  December coffee posted a key reversal down on Friday due to producer selling as harvest is beginning in southeast Mexico. Session highs fell short of testing broken long-term support marked by the April 1975 low, which crosses at 45.25. Additional weakness on Monday is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. Closes below Monday's low would renew this year's decline while setting the stage for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40- cents later this year.  December cocoa posted a key reversal up on Friday following a spike below the 62% retracement level of the September/October rally, which crosses at 979. Additional strength on Monday is needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern. However, closes above Wednesday's high at 1022 are needed to signal that a short-term bottom was posted with today's low. Stochastics and RSI are bearish but oversold hinting that a low is in or near.   March sugar posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday hinting that a short-term top might be in placed. A close below this week's low crossing at 660 is needed before this can be confirmed. Stochastics are bullish but becoming overbought warning traders to use caution as a short-term top might be in or is near. If the rally off this month's low continues this summer's downtrend line crossing near 709 is March's next upside target.   December cotton closed higher on Friday due to short covering as it posted a key reversal up due to its extreme oversold condition. However, December remains below broken long-term support crossing at 29.50 cents. With December cotton trading at new 29-year lows, additional weakness is still possible. The daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) is still in a bearish mode signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.

Lumber was a rare exception, shooting higher on the basis of increased cash market activity.  Wheat also ended with a solid advance tied to exports.  Corn and Soybeans, however, continued to be pressured by favorable weather conditions, while there was little movement in Energies, although Natural Gas was firm.  Cotton slumped to 29-year lows, Coffee looked uncertain, and Hogs lost ground.  Short-covering on Friday ahead of the weekend produced nice bounces for Gold and Copper.

He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1094&>, RB! D! AL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."" But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.   Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard r! un! , but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1790&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 ! Jo! nes overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1072&>, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=133393&> , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28! /0! 1 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He rem! ai! ns a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Su! nd! ay at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&ra! nd! om=3664&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.  Cowboys <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a scor! e ! in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1094&>, RB DAL - P! in! k Panthers Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."" But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.   Daunte Culpepper <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1296&>, WR DEN - TexOK Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run, but the Bro! nc! os let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1790&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1253&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1204&>, WR SD - McKay Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1843&>, TE SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Jones overca! me! a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1072&>, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Grigsby Upd! at! ed 10/28/01  Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=187382&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins! h! eld Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matte! r ! what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1440&>, RB WAS - TexOK Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1757&>, RB PHI - TayDang Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Grigsby Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Ph! il! adelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Top Dogs Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=45! 03! &key=133230&>, WR ARI - Tomaski Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Tomaski Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.  Cowboys <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=8&>, DT DAL - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in ! Su! nday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Pink Panthers Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Metz Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

The big rally in the hogs supported the cattle futures today, as did short covering. Prices scored a mildly bullish ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart today--whereby the high was higher and the low was lower than the previous session's trading range, with a higher close.   December lean hogs closed up $1.80 today at $49.65. A bullish monthly USDA hogs and pigs report Friday-- showing a smaller pig crop than last year--boosted futures sharply higher today. Ideas this week's kill will be less than last week's also lent strength to futures prices today.   GRAINS: December corn futures closed 2 cents lower at $2.03 1/2 today. Prices dropped to a fresh contract low today on fund selling. The market feels pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. After today's decline, I don't think there's much downside left in corn.   January soybeans closed unchanged at $4.34 1/4 today. More solid export demand, in the form of strong weekly export inspections data today, failed to push the market higher. While prices could retest the contract lows scored last week, or even drop below them, I do think the downside from present price levels is limited.   December Chicago SRW wheat closed off 3 3/4 cents at $2.91 1/4 today. Prices backed off today on some profit  taking from the recent gains, and no chart damage was done today. Prices Friday hit a fresh three-month high.   SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 5 points higher at 6.77 cents today. Prices closed near the session high. A fledging three-week-old uptrend line is still intact on the daily bar chart--but just barely. Bears still have the technical edge, overall.   December N.Y. coffee closed 25 points higher at 43.65 cents today. Not much fresh news. The bears are in full command of coffee at present. The only encouraging news to the bulls is the recent increase in volatility at these lower price levels.   December N.Y. cocoa closed $2 higher today, at $997. There was enough follow-through buying today to confirm a bullish key reversal on the daily bar chart.   December cotton closed 8 points higher at 28.94 cents in  quiet trading today. Prices last week dropped down below key long-term support at 29.50 cents. This opens the door to declines to the 26-cent area, which is the lows seen in 1972, basis nearby futures.   January orange juice on Friday afternoon closed at 90.65. That's up 155 points from the Thursday evening close. Prices gapped higher Friday and bulls still have the big edge.   METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed up $1.40 at $279.70 an ounce today. The weaker U.S. dollar helped the yellow metal today. Prices are still seeing a corrective bounce in a bear market, but bulls will take what they can get at present.   December silver futures closed $0.028 higher at $4.243 an ounce today. Prices hit a fresh five-week low last week and bears have the big edge.   December N.Y. copper closed 40 points lower at 63.10 cents. Prices last week dropped to a contract low of 62.00 cents. Bears rule.  ENERGIES: December crude closed $0.10 higher at $22.15 today. It was a fairly quiet day. The daily chart still looks bearish. However, the longer the market trades sideways, the more that favors the bulls and some ""basing"" activity.   December heating oil closed 33 points higher at .6337 today. It was a quiet day today. The daily chart still looks bearish as prices hover not that far above the recent lows.   December unleaded gasoline closed 8 points lower at .5873 today. Prices scored a mildly bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar chart today. The daily chart still looks  bearish.  December natural gas closed $0.177 higher at $3.36 today.   Prices scored a fresh seven-week high today. Prices last  week pushed up above a longer-term downtrend line on the daily bar chart and today it was negated.   STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 125 points higher today at .9018. Bulls needed a day like today after the bears knocked them around recently. Bears remain in control.   The December Japanese yen closed up 52 points at .8218 today. Today saw a rebound in a bear market and bears rule. Prices pushed to a three-month low last week.   The December Swiss franc closed 91 points higher at .6134 today. Bulls needed today after their recent whipping. A steep five-week-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the upside and negated today.   The December Canadian dollar closed 13 points higher at  .6351 today. Bears still rule as prices are in a four-month-old downtrend on the daily bar chart.   The December British pound closed up 164 points at 1.4486 today. Today's big gains negated a three-week-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart and puts the bulls and bears back on a level playing field, overall.   The September U.S. dollar index closed 119 points lower at  114.71 today. Prices gapped lower on the daily bar chart today and they closed near the session low. Technical damage was done with today's big downmove.   December U.S. T-bonds closed 10/32 higher at 108 1/32. The  bulls continue their push north as a new for-the-move  high was set today. Prices are at lofty levels, but there is nothing on the daily chart that suggests prices cannot go farther north.   December S&P 500 futures closed off 28.50 at 1,073.50. Prices closed near the session low today as trading has turned sideways and choppier. Poor earnings reports, a weaker economic picture and an increasing anthrax scare will limit upside moves.

Unfortunately, we discovered that there is no direct ""fool-proof"" way to accomplish this.  However, we have come up with a couple of things to try:  Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other information they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifies each deal / cut.  Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating the data to Unify much easier. Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the ""scheduled quantity"" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub.  It's possible that this file contains cut information itself, which would possibly alleviate the need to use the Passport file altogether.  I believe that succinctly recaps the results of our meeting today.  If I have misrepresented anything, please let me know.  Also, feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

A Dow Jones Newswires Column     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- So Enron Corp. (ENE) says it wants to be more transparent - to make its impenetrable financial results and corporate structure easier for investors and analysts to understand.   Based on its announcements Thursday, however, it still has a heck of a long way to go.    With Enron's restatement Thursday of nearly five years' worth of earnings and additional information about the maze of off-balance-sheet deals related to it, we now have a lot more information about the mess at Enron than we had 24 hours ago. But we're not much closer to understanding just what HAPPENED to leave Enron in such a mess - and that's because the company's explanations of all this continue to be dense, confusing and next to impossible to grasp.    Try this tidbit, from the Form 8-K Enron filed about the restatements Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission:    ""In addition, Enron's net income is reduced for specific JEDI revenues previously allocated to Chewco, relating to the appreciation in value of Enron stock, which eliminate upon consolidation. This, in effect, reduces Enron's share of JEDI's earnings.""    Huh? And no, it doesn't help you to know that ""Chewco"" is an entity that wasn't included in Enron's financial results but which Enron now admits should have been. Or that ""JEDI"" isn't a ""Star Wars"" reference but a limited partnership in which both Enron and Chewco had invested. It's still impenetrable.    Then there are the times when Enron just plain doesn't give enough information. The company says its decision that Chewco should be included in its results after all ""is based on current information that Chewco did not meet the accounting criteria to qualify as ... unconsolidated..."" Uh - okay. WHY didn't it meet the criteria, and why did Enron previously believe that it did? Enron doesn't say.    Finally, Enron makes some assertions that just make you scratch your head. The company says part of the restatement of its earnings stems from unspecified ""prior-year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications which were determined to be immaterial in the year originally proposed.""    Hmmm. Beyond the fact that Enron doesn't elaborate on the nature of these ""audit adjustments and reclassifications,"" or why they were originally considered immaterial, consider that according to Enron's own figures in the 8-K, they add up to a negative earnings impact of $87 million since 1997. That amount doesn't sound like any definition of ""immaterial"" I've ever heard.    An Enron spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.    In fairness, this lack of clarity may be all but inevitable given Enron's Byzantine structure, which involves dealings with outside but related entities that also have third parties involved, which in one case have a subsidiary that allowed Enron to hedge the risks of an investment, and in another case is selling assets purchased from Enron to OTHER entities in order to finish paying Enron for the original transaction, and ... you get the idea. It's next to impossible to make clear because Enron's structure is just too baroque to understand in the first place.    The market is plenty puzzled by all this, even in the wake of Enron's attempt to clarify things. Take a look at the company's drunken-sailor stock chart from Thursday. After news of the restatements hit, Enron stock first jumped higher, going as high as $10 a share, then soon dropped back, to as low as $8.40, as investors started to digest the details of the news. Then up again to about $9.25, then down again to its current level of around $8.50.    There's no reason investors should be confused like this. There is absolutely no reason that a reasonably intelligent layman, with an elementary working knowledge of corporate finance, should be unable to understand the regulatory filings, structure, earnings and balance sheet of any public company.    If that's happens, it's the company's fault, not the investor's - either because the company hasn't explained things well enough or because its structure is needlessly complicated to begin with. If Enron wants to get back the market's confidence, fixing that problem, one way or the other, would be a good place to start.    -By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5976; michael.rapoport@dowjones.com    Folder Name: Dynegy Inc.

"Mike,  Just a quick rundown of the problems we encountered with Liz in scheduling.=  As you know, we started her out scheduling El Paso. After about 7 weeks of=  training and having her do intraday nominations, we put her in the weekend=  rotation. The first weekend she worked, it became obvious that she still d= id not understand physical gas flow. Shannon spent the whole weekend on the=  phone talking her through any changes that needed to be made. She didn't s= eem to remember anything that she had been trained on daily for the previou= s 7 weeks. When I spoke to her on the following Monday, she indicated that = she just became confused after someone tried to make a change in the nomina= tion. We continued to work very closely with her to make her understand how=  physical gas flow works on El Paso. I started receiving some complaints fr= om customers who were very much aware that she didn't understand what she w= as doing. After several more weeks, Shannon was becoming frustrated with th= e lack of progress, so I told Shannon to write down step by step every piec= e of the day to day nomination and renom process. That weekend went much mo= re smoothly because Liz had every step and every scenario drawn out for her= . I have since had her scheduling SoCal Ehrenberg while the new people are = training and that seems to be working out OK. I think the biggest problem w= ith Liz is an inability to think outside the box. but she is willing to wor= k hard. I hope this helps.=20  Patti",mike.grigsby@enron.com,patti.sullivan@enron.com,Elizabeth Shim,2001-11-14 16:12:07-08:00,received

The NASDAQ posted another inside day with a slightly lower close as it consolidates below minor resistance crossing at 1933.94. Weekly momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible during the last half of November. If the aforementioned resistance level is cleared, the 25% retracement level of the 2000/2001 decline crossing at 2071.93 is a potential target later this year. The December S&P 500 index closed lower on Friday but held above the 50% retracement level of the May/September decline crossing at 1137.45. The door remains open for a test of the reaction high crossing at 1163.90 later this month.   The Dow closed slightly lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead of the weekend. Losses were limited following the release of today?s economic reports and ideas that the conflict in Afghanistan may come to an end by the end of the year. If this fall?s rebound continues, the 62% retracement level of this year?s decline crossing at 10094.10 is the Dow?s next target.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  December T-bonds extended this week?s sharp sell off on Friday and tested the 75% retracement level of the Sept./Oct. rally crossing at 104-29. December bonds have decline over 5 points since Tuesday. While momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible during the last half of November I would not be surprised to see a modest short covering bounce early next week. Longer-term the door is open for a possible test of September?s low crossing at 102-17.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index closed higher on Friday due to a rebound in energies, grains, fiber and foods. Session lows fell short of testing trendline support drawn across this fall?s lows. Closes below this support level crossing near 186 are needed to confirm that the shallow rebound off October?s low has ended. At the same time closes above this week?s high crossing at 190.46 are needed to renew this fall?s rally.   ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed higher on Friday due to short covering as it consolidated some of this week?s sharp losses. However, upside potential appears limited due to the possibility of a protracted fight between Russia and OPEC that could last for some time.   December crude oil posted an inside day with a modestly higher close due to light short covering. However, December remains poised to test of the 75% retracement level of the 1998/2000 rally crossing at 16.83 later this month. If this support level fails to halt this fall?s decline the January 1999 reaction high crossing at 13.75 is a possible target later this fall. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible during the last half of November.   December heating oil posted an inside day with a modestly higher close on Thursday due to light short covering. However, a sell off ahead of the close tempered some of today?s gains leaving the door open for sideways trading on Monday. Session highs tested broken support marked by the October 1999 low crossing at 53.40. If this week?s decline continues, the 75% retracement level of the 1999/2000 rally crossing at 48.50 is December?s next likely target. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are likely into the last half of November.   December unleaded gas ended higher on Friday due to light short covering as it consolidated some of this week?s losses. However, today?s short covering bounce fell short of testing broken support crossing at 51.87. While another day or two of short covering is possible, the door is open for additional weakness with the June 1999 low crossing at 47.00 being December?s next likely target. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible near-term.   December Henry Hub natural posted an upside reversal on Friday after spiked below October?s low crossing at 2.535. Additional strength on Monday is needed to confirm today?s bullish reversal pattern thereby increasing the odds that this week?s low marked a double bottom with October?s low. If the decline off October?s high continues, weekly fib support crossing at 2.402 is a potential target later this year. Short-term momentum indicators are bearish but have entered their respective oversold zones hinting that a double bottom might be forming if October?s low can halt this month?s decline.   CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The December Dollar posted another quiet inside day with a lower close as it consolidates just below trading range resistance crossing at 116.60. Closes above Wednesday?s high at 117.05 would confirm a breakout above this falls trading range and could lead to a test of August?s reaction high crossing at 117.49 later this month. Stochastics remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible.   The December Swiss Franc closed higher on Friday as it extended its short covering bounce off Wednesday?s low. Monday will be a key day in near-term direction of the market. A higher opening followed by a lower close on Monday would signal that this week?s short covering bounce has likely come to an end. Closes below Wednesday?s low at .5961 would renew December?s decline and set the stage for a likely test of the 50% retracement level of the July/September rally crossing at .5944. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible during the later part of November.   The December Canadian Dollar closed modestly lower on Friday, as is consolidated above October?s broken downtrend line. Today?s mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Monday. If December extends this week?s short covering rally the 25% retracement level of the July/November decline crossing at .6322 is December?s next upside target. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term.   The December Japanese Yen closed out the week on a low note on Friday. However, session lows fell short of testing October?s low crossing at .8132. If this support level is broken thereby renewing December?s decline off September?s high this summer?s low crossing at .8060 is a potential target later this year. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling sideways to lower prices are possible into the last half of November.   PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  December gold posted a second consecutive close below October?s low on Friday thereby opening the door for a possible test of August?s reaction low crossing at 272.60 later this month. However, today?s mid-range close leaves the door open for a possible short covering bounce on Monday. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible during the last half of November.   December silver posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday as it consolidates below broken support crossing at 4.15. Close below last Friday?s low crossing at 4.055 cents would renew December?s decline off September?s high and could lead to a possible test of weekly support crossing at 3.90 later this month.   December copper posted a key reversal up on Friday ending Thursday?s correction. At the same time December will need to close above Thursday?s high crossing at 69.60 to renew its rebound off last week?s low. If the rally resumes, August?s high crossing at 70.60 is December?s next target. Short-term momentum indicators are bullish but becoming overbought hinting that a test of August?s high early next week could trigger a round of profit taking.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  December corn closed higher on Friday due in large part to spillover strength from soybeans and wheat. This morning?s export sales report came in at 31.9 million bushels, which was near the upper end of pre-report estimates but still below the pace needed to reach USDA export projections. Today?s high-range close sets the stage for a firmer opening on Monday but closes above initial gap resistance crossing at 2.09 1/2 are needed to trigger new buying interest in the market. Until then sideways trading will continue to dominate the market near-term.   December wheat closed sharply higher on Friday as short covering gains were exaggerated as buy stops were hit above 2.86, which pushed December above last week?s high of 2.88 1/2. While a setback is possible on Monday due to ideas that today?s gains were overdone today?s rally turned a number of momentum indicators neutral to bullish signaling that the sell off from October?s high has come to an end. Today?s rally found little support from this week?s export sales report, which came in at 14 million bushels and well within pre-report estimates.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  January soybeans closed higher on Friday as bulls stepped up to the plate and defended their positions following this week?s breakout above initial gap resistance crossing at 4.44 1/. Today?s rally fell just short of filling October?s gap crossing at 4.53 1/2, which coincides with the 25% retracement level of the July/October decline crossing at 4.54. Closes above these key resistance levels are needed to open the door for a larger-degree post-harvest rebound that could last into the end of the year. Today?s weekly export sales report came in near the low end of pre-report estimates at 27.25 million bushels. However, expectations for improving foreign and domestic demand in the coming weeks along with a lack of sellers helps push January to new highs for the week.   December soybean meal closed steady on Friday after testing the upper boundary of October?s trading range crossing at 167. A round of profit taking ahead of the close erased early gains leaving the door open for further consolidation on Monday. At the same time short-term momentum indicators remain bullish signaling sideways to higher prices are possible during the last half of November. Closes above 167 could lead to a test of September?s high crossing at 171 later this month.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  December hogs closed sharply lower on Friday erasing the gains of the past three trading sessions. Much of today?s pressure in the December contract was due to bull spreaders dumping their positions ahead of the weekend. With packers covered on their needed into next Wednesday, weaker cash bids are expected to start the new week on Monday. Momentum indicators remain bearish hinting that December could renew its decline off last week?s high and possibly test October?s low at 46.70 later next week before a bottom is in place.   December cattle closed higher on Friday due to short covering ahead of this afternoon?s cattle-on-feed report. Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that Monday?s low likely marked an important bottom. The late- week rebound has V-bottom written all over the market. This afternoon?s cattle-on-feed report was termed bearish. The big question is whether or not the decline ahead of the report factored in all of today?s bearish news. I am looking for a setback on Monday as the market absorbs today?s negative report. Here are the highlights of today?s report.   USDA estimate Ave. guess Range of guesses  On Feed as of Nov. 1 ----- 100% 99.2% 98.0- 100.00%  Placed in October -------- 97% 91.5% 87.0- 97.5%  Marketed in October ------ 99% 99.1% 97.0- 100.00%  FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  December coffee posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday and remains poised to extend its short covering rebound off October?s low. Closes above Wednesday?s high at 50.00 cents would renew this week?s rally setting the stage for a test of August?s gap crossing at 54.00 later this year. Momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that additional gains are possible near-term.   December cocoa gapped up and closed sharply higher on Friday as it cleared both last February?s high at 1237 and weekly fib resistance crossing at 1261. This week?s breakout above February?s high has opened the door for a possible test of the 62% retracement level of the 1997/2000 decline crossing at 1349 later this year. At the same time, if today?s gap is filled next week it would signal that a top has likely been posted as today?s gap was an exhaustion gap.  March sugar closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead of the weekend. If the rally continues, the 50% retracement level of the June/October decline crossing at 755 is March?s next target. Closes below this fall?s uptrend line crossing near 691 would confirm that a short-term top has been posted. Weekly momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into late-November.  December cotton closed higher on Friday supported by this week?s stellar export sales report that came in at 455,200 bales, the strongest of the marketing year. Nevertheless, December failed to exceed this week?s high at 35.60 and closed mid-range on the day. This leaves the door open for sideways trading on Monday. Closes below Thursday?s low at 33.40 could trigger new selling, which could end the late fall rally. If the rally resumes, fib resistance crossing at 37.25 is December?s next target. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their respective overbought zones warning traders to use caution as a short-term top might be near.

The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox  at the end of every week, and will include news about the  web site; tips on using all the features available; and  answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron  Guru.""    PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS  The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks,  with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule,  Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds  they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not  determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets.  The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding  the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your  regular season.   If your team is still in contention, go to  NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes  during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be  available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff  matchup.   GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS  Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the  common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.   MVP.com   Save 10% on Speak No Evil, Hear No Evil Monkey Bikes...

We  invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on  players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance  to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like  yourself!    Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot.  Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin  Muhammad in week ten?   G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston  has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing  playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from  a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last  weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success  against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with  Muhammad.   Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.     G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?    G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.

He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.     FANTASY FOOTBALL RADIO SHOW  Fantasy Football on Live Radio!

Meanwhile, the Dollar stood strong and Stocks put in another solid performance helped by progress in the U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan, although another sharp drop in U.S. industrial production tempered enthusiasm.  Export rumors fired up Wheat as well as Soybeans which racked up five-week highs.  While confusion over OPEC's output intentions dominated the headlines, the soft global economy was the underlying factor weighing on Crude, while Natural Gas came under pressure from unusually warm weather conditions.  Copper was firm, but tentative, Gold was weak, and a rally in Orange Juice fizzled out.

I linked all of the products to Reuters.  In order to get the product prices to update real time you need to have Reuters open on your computer.  Take a look at it and if you like it we can get it on the plasma.  Sorry this has taken so long, our Reuters people aren't exactly the quickest when it comes to adding products.  Anyway, let know.

"Let's not forget the fact that Citizens has cut Enron more during the life of the deal.  The only company walking away from a deal will be Enron.

As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  ","houston <.ward@enron.com>, l..gay@enron.com",mike.grigsby@enron.com,RE: Griffith Sales,2001-11-19 10:07:04-08:00,sent

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything. This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated dates for each task below.  1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20). 2.  Merge curves together (11/21) 3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21) 4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26) 5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28) 6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5) 7.

Expectations for an economic recovery during the first half of 2002 along with U.S. military victories in Afghanistan also helped support today's gains. The NASDAQ closed just above minor resistance crossing at 1933.94. Multiple closes above this resistance level would set the stage for a possible test of the 25% retracement level of the 2000/2001 decline crossing at 2071.93 later this year. The December S&P 500 index also closed higher on Monday and is poised to test September?s high crossing at 1163.90 possibly on Tuesday.   The Dow closed higher on Monday as it extended last week?s breakout above this summer?s downtrend line. The stage is set for a possible test of the 62% retracement level of the May/September decline crossing at 10,094.10 in the near future. Investors remain encouraged by reports of U.S. military victories in Afghanistan and ideas that the worse might be over for the economy.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  December T-bonds posted an inside day with a modestly higher close due to short covering following last Friday?s spike below the 75% retracement level of the Sept./Oct. rally crossing at 104-29. Today?s mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Tuesday. I would not be surprised to see another day or two of consolidation above last Friday?s high. However, momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into the end of November If the decline resumes, September?s low crossing at 102-17 is December?s next likely target.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index closed higher on Monday due to strength in energies, grains and livestock markets. However, closes above last week?s high crossing at 190.46 are needed to renew this fall?s rally. Momentum indicators are overbought and have turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of November. Closes below last week?s low at 186.23 would extend the CRB?s decline off last week?s high.  ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed higher on Monday with the exception of crude oil due to short covering ahead of the close. Early weakness was tied to indications that Russia is not considering any cuts in production. However, a short covering rebound in the markets ahead of the close as traders begin to square some of their short positions ahead of Tuesday?s API inventory report erased early losses.   December crude oil closed lower on Monday but near session highs due to a bounce ahead of the close. Early weakness led to a spike below the 75% retracement level of the 1998/2000 rally crossing at 16.83. Closes below this support level could lead to a test of the January 1999 reaction high crossing at 13.75 later this year. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is still possible into the end of November.   December heating oil closed slightly higher on Monday due to a short covering bounce ahead of the close. Session lows fell short of testing the 75% retracement level of the 1999/2000-rally crossing at 48.50. Monday?s high-range close leaves the door open for additional short covering on Tuesday ahead of this week?s API inventory report. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into the end of November.   December unleaded gas posted a key reversal up on Monday. However, today?s short covering bounce fell short of testing broken support crossing at 51.87. I would not be surprised to see additional short covering on Tuesday as December consolidates some of its recent losses. However, the door remains open for a possible test of the June 1999 low crossing at 47.00 later this month. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible near-term.   December Henry Hub natural gas closed higher on Monday confirming last Friday?s upside reversal. Forecasts calling for colder temperatures to move across the high demand regions of the country by the end of November prompted today?s short covering rally. Closes above last week?s high crossing at 2.87 would greatly increase the odds that last week?s low marked a double bottom with October?s low. Short- term momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral to bullish hinting that a low is in or near.   CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The December Dollar gapped up and closed higher on Monday but ended the day below last Wednesday?s high at 117.05. Closes above this resistance level are needed to confirm a breakout above this falls trading range. Profit taking ahead of the close erased most of today?s gains while leaving the door open for a setback on Tuesday. If today?s gap were filled, it would indicate that the gap was an exhaustion gap and today?s high was nothing more than a spike above trading range. Stochastics are bullish but becoming overbought hinting a short-term top might be in or is near.   The December Swiss Franc closed lower on Monday but near session highs due to a late-day bounce. Closes above last Friday?s high at .6045 would renew its short covering bounce off last Wednesday?s low. Closes below last week?s low at .5961 are needed to renew December?s decline and set the stage for a likely test of the 50% retracement level of the July/September rally crossing at .5944. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible during the later part of November.   The December Canadian Dollar closed modestly higher on Monday as it extended last week?s breakout above October?s broken downtrend line. Today?s low-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Tuesday. If the rebound off last week?s low continues, the 25% retracement level of the July/November decline crossing at .6322 is December?s next upside target. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near- term.   The December Japanese Yen closed below October?s low crossing at .8132 on Monday thereby opening the door for additional weakness into the end of November. If the decline off September?s high continues, July?s low crossing at .8060 is a potential target later this year. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of November.   PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  December gold spiked below August?s reaction low crossing at 272.60 before a short covering bounce tempered some of today?s losses. Closes below this key support level would open the door for a possible test of August?s reaction low crossing at 268.40 later this year. Strength in the U.S. Dollar and equities provided much of today?s pressure on the market. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into the end of November.   December silver posted a new low close for November, as it appears poised to renew this fall?s decline following the recent breakout below key support crossing at 4.15. Close below 4.055 cents would open the door for a test of weekly support crossing at 3.90 later this month. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible near-term.   December copper closed higher on Monday confirming last Friday?s key reversal up. However, today?s low-range close leaves the door open for a possible setback on Tuesday. Closes above last week?s high at 69.60 are needed to renew December?s rebound off November?s low. Closes below 66.70 would all but confirm that a short-term top has likely been posted. Short-term momentum indicators are bullish but becoming overbought hinting that a round of profit taking could begin later this week.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March corn gapped up and closed higher on Monday due to technical buying. Session highs tested the bottom of October?s gap crossing at 2.21 1/2. Closes above this resistance level would likely trigger additional fund short covering now that this year?s harvest is almost wrapped up. However, it will take closes above the top of October?s gap crossing at 2.25 1/4, which coincides with this summer?s downtrend line to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of November.   March wheat closed fractionally higher on Monday as it extended last Friday?s impressive rally. I would not be surprised to see a steady to lower close on Tuesday as March might try and consolidate some of its recent gains. Stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of November. If the rebound off last week?s low continues, October?s high at 3.03 is March?s next target.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  January soybeans closed fractionally lower on Monday due to light profit taking after filling October?s gap at 4.54 in early trading. Additional pressure came from spillover weakness from soybean meal however, losses were limited due to light producer selling. Closes above today?s high are needed to open the door for a larger-degree post-harvest rebound that could last into the end of the year. Momentum indicators remain overbought while trend-following indicators such as the ADX are entering bullish trend modes signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible.   December soybean meal closed sharply lower due to profit taking on Monday after testing the upper boundary of the October/November trading range crossing at 167. Today?s low- range close leaves the door open for additional selling on Tuesday. Until December closes above 167, it will remain a trading range affair.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  February hogs closed higher on Monday but near session lows due to bull spreading by commercials and funds. Continued weakness in the cash market along with spillover selling late in the day from bellies also tempered early gains. If the rebound off last week?s low continues, the early- November high crossing at 55.12 is February?s next target. Closes above this resistance level are needed to extend February?s rally off October?s low. Momentum indicators are neutral to bullish hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of November.  February cattle closed higher on Monday for the fifth day in a row despite most traders calling last Friday?s cattle-on- feed report bearish. February?s ability to rally on bearish news confirms that the early-November decline had already factored in last Friday?s bearish report. Profit taking ahead of the close tempered some of today?s gains leaving the door open for sideways trading on Tuesday. Closes above the September/October downtrend line crossing near 70.50 are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  March coffee closed lower on Monday due to first-notice day sales by hedgers. With the market closed Thursday and Friday, today?s losses might have been somewhat exaggerated. March needs to close above last week?s high, which coincides with the 25% retracement level of the May/October decline crossing at 53.04. Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to open the door for a larger-degree rebound into the end of the year. Closes below last week?s low at 47.50 would confirm that a short-term top has been posted.   March cocoa closed higher on Monday but near mid-range as it consolidates above last February?s high at 1257. If this resistance level is cleared, the March 1999 reaction high crossing at 1341 is March?s next upside target. Momentum indicators have become overbought while trend-following indicators such as the ADX are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of November. Today?s mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Tuesday.  March sugar closed higher on Monday and appears poised to test the 50% retracement level of the June/October decline crossing at 755 later this month. Weekly momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into late-November. Closes below last Wednesday?s gap crossing at 726 would increase the odds that a short- term top has likely been posted.   March cotton closed lower on Monday amidst selling ahead of first notice day. Heavy commercial and producer selling on Monday overshadowed last Friday?s bullish export report indicating that the short covering rebound off October?s low might be coming to an end. While export demand has been strong with cumulative sales running at 83.3% of USDA?s projection compared with 61.9% for this time of near, this year?s bumper U.S. crop will continue to limit near-term upside potential in the market. Momentum indicators are bullish but overbought warning bullish traders to use caution. Closes below last Thursday?s low at 35.00 would confirm that a short-term top was posted last Wednesday.

Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  ",mike.grigsby@enron.com,houston <.ward@enron.com>,RE: Griffith Sales,2001-11-20 07:00:19-08:00,received

"     Monday, November 19   BCS bowls starting to fill up    _____    By Brad Edwards Special to ESPN.com   Two spots are now taken.  Six spots remain.  But the two most enviable positions in the Bowl Championship Series are still up for grabs. The next couple of weekends (maybe three) will decide which teams play for the national title, although the list of potential competitors seems to be shrinking.  Stock up: Oklahoma The Sooners are just two wins away from Pasadena, as are Nebraska and Miami. The difference, however, is that one of Oklahoma's remaining games is at home against a team with a 3-7 record (Oklahoma State). Rivalry games are often unpredictable, but the Cowboys don't have much of a chance in this one. Not this year. Not against this team.  That puts OU in the Big 12 title game against the winner of Nebraska-Colorado. It's a neutral-field game for a chance to defend their national title, and a team with a loss can't ask for much more than that.  Stock down: BYU The Cougars keep winning, which of course, is the object of football. But a very weak schedule and some tiny victory margins aren't earning them any respect in the computers. And even though BYU is more interested in gaining admiration from Fiesta Bowl reps than from computer analysts, it won't do them any good unless they reach the top 12 of the final BCS Standings.   If they do get that high in the rankings, is certainly an advantage to have a fan base within driving distance of Arizona at a time when many Americans are hesitant to fly. But the reality is that the Fiesta Bowl is being played in the traditional Rose Bowl time slot on New Year's Day and will likely have Pac-10 champion Oregon as one of its participants. With that much in place, the Big Ten champ becomes a very attractive opponent -- especially if that team is Michigan. It's too bad for BYU that the Wolverines dodged the upset bullet over the weekend.  Michigan is just one home victory away from being in the BCS pool, and it's very tough to imagine any bowl selecting the Cougars over the Wolverines, given a choice between the two. BYU has a good team, a good name and a loyal following of fans, but they can't match Michigan's drawing power. Unless the Fiesta Bowl believes it needs the Cougars to sell out the stadium, they probably won't be going to Tempe to ring in the New Year. BYU won its national title by beating Michigan in the 1984 Holiday Bowl, but this bowl battle is likely to be won be the Maize and Blue.   Under the radar The ACC (Maryland) and Pac-10 (Oregon) have both determined their BCS representative, and the Big East (Miami) is all but official. And one way or the other, the Big Ten champion will also be determined by this Saturday. So, even though the Big 12 and SEC teams won't be decided until December, it's time to start making some guesses about who will get the at-large bids. The reality is that there won't be many teams to choose from. If Tennessee had lost to Kentucky and Michigan had lost to Wisconsin on Saturday -- both of which almost happened -- that might have presented a scenario in which there were no eligible at-large teams from the ACC, Big East, Big Ten or SEC. And since the Big 12 can't get more than two teams into the BCS, and Oregon has already played both Stanford and Washington State, everything would have played perfectly into the hands of an undefeated BYU.  The order of choice by the BCS bowls is dependent upon which teams are playing for the national title, but if things play out according to form and a Big 12 team finishes at No. 1, the Fiesta will get the first pick. If they choose the Big Ten champion, the Sugar Bowl will likely take another Big 12 team with one at-large selection, and the other choice should be the Tennessee-Florida loser to the Orange Bowl. If the Fiesta does take BYU as an at-large pick, that second team from the Big 12 would go to either the Sugar or the Orange.   Florida still needs two losses from the group of Nebraska, Miami and Oklahoma to have a good chance to reach the Rose Bowl, but they might have been in even bigger trouble if not for a narrow escape by Tennessee over the weekend. The Vols are the only team the Gators can still get bonus points for a win against, and those would have been all but gone if Tennessee had lost to Kentucky.  Oklahoma is certainly in good shape if they win out and all else goes according to form, but there is one ""what if?"" scenario to think about. If Texas loses at Texas A&M and Colorado beats Nebraska on Friday, would Oklahoma still finish higher than Florida if both teams win out? The Texas loss would cost the Sooners some bonus points, and the Nebraska loss would prevent them from having an opportunity to pick up more. It's too early to know the impact of that series of events, but it is something for OU fans to think about over Thanksgiving dinner.  Texas has been all but eliminated from the national title hunt after Oklahoma's win at Texas Tech. The only remaining hope for the Longhorns is an Oklahoma State upset of the Sooners in Norman. Good luck. If Colorado beats Nebraska this week and then Oklahoma the following week in the Big 12 Championship Game, that might leave Texas as the highest ranked team from the conference, but it would not be enough to get them into the BCS top two unless Florida or Miami also loses.  If the season ended today ... The top three still look the same, and all those behind them are trying to keep hope alive.   Official BCS standings 1. Nebraska 2. Miami 3. Oklahoma 4. Florida 5. Oregon 6. Texas 7. Tennessee 8. Illinois 9. Stanford 10. Michigan   BCS Game of the Week: Nebraska at Colorado It's hard to believe a team could be 11-0 without winning any type of crown, but that's the reality the Cornhuskers carry into Boulder. The winner of this game gets the Big 12 North championship and a trip to Dallas for the conference title. A loss might instead send Nebraska to Dallas for the Cotton Bowl.  This game is not only to keep the Huskers' title hopes alive, but as referenced above, it could also have an effect on the BCS futures of Oklahoma, Texas and Florida, as well as Tennessee and Oregon. Throw in the fact that this game normally comes down to the wire, and you can sense the drama it might present all across the country.  Brad Edwards is a college football researcher for ESPN.

Shares of Enron fell $1.17, or 13 percent, to $7.89 in late morning trading. Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in July 2006 were bid at 77 cents on $1 of face value and offered at 81 cents, down more than 3 percent from yesterday, traders said.  Enron, whose shares plunged 90 percent this year as accounting errors led to earnings restatements, a federal investigation and a management shakeup, said it has less than $2 billion in cash or credit lines. Dynegy plans to complete its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask its lenders to restructure payment schedules to survive.  ``This filing shows that Enron is in a precarious financial situation,'' said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates Enron shares `hold' and doesn't own them. ``They have to stay afloat for the Dynegy deal to go through, and that now looks difficult.''  Dynegy agreed Nov. 9 to buy Enron in a transaction now valued at $25 billion in stock and assumed debt. The difference between Dynegy's offer for Enron and the price of Enron shares widened to more than 45 percent from 29 percent yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  ``It's become more clear that the chances of this deal going through aren't 90 percent, but much closer to fifty-fifty,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty Utilities Fund, with 1.6 million Enron shares. ``There's just so much information that is unknowable'' about Enron's financial position, he said.  SEC Filing  Last week, Enron Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley said the company has $8 billion invested in ``non-core'' businesses, including broadband and the Dabhol power plant in India. Whalley said Enron will sell those business to pay down debt. Enron expects to get ``billions'' from the sales, Whalley said, without being more specific.  Enron wouldn't comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts. Asset sales valued at about $800 million are expected close by the end of this year, the company said yesterday in its third-quarter filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission.  Most of the $9.15 billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter, when the Dynegy buyout is scheduled to close, according to the SEC filing.  Dynegy and ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, may have to help Enron win refinancing agreements with its lenders, said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage the $1.4 billion Strong American Utilities Fund, which is 5 percent Dynegy shares.  ``I never dreamt (the $9.15 billion in debt due) would be that large, coming due all at once,'' Vuchetich said. ``It calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place.''  Enron yesterday reduced third-quarter results by 3 cents a share, bringing the period's loss to 87 cents, or $664 million, according to the SEC filing. On Nov. 8, Enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $586 million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books. That included a third-quarter reduction of $17 million.  A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by Standard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership, the company said in the filing.  Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the partnership's assets, Enron said. The company said it's working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.  Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and take debt off its books. Its shares plunged this year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide losses from failed investments.  Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said last month that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity.  Fourth Quarter  Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing affiliated partnership may cut Enron's fourth-quarter earnings, Enron said. Enron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by $700 million, the filing said.  ChevronTexaco, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout. It provided the first $1.5 billion a week ago.  Shares of ChevronTexaco, based in San Francisco, rose $2.51 to $84.42 in midmorning trading. Dynegy fell 50 cents to $43.05. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston.  Enron's Lay admitted last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to Dynegy. Before the buyout was announced, Enron stock had fallen 90 percent this year.

The gain that was seen in physical current month MTM value was offset by a loss in transport revenue.  The estimate was mainly off because of the price curveshift which is taken directly from TDS.

The NASDAQ closed lower for the second day in a row however, a short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday. If this week?s decline continues, trendline support crossing near 1816.25 is a possible target later this month. Closes below this fall?s uptrend line would confirm that this fall?s rally has come to an end. The December S&P 500 index also closed lower on Wednesday as it extended profit taking that began on Tuesday. December closed just below the 50% retracement level of this summer?s decline crossing at 1137.45 today. Closes below last Friday?s low at 1130.50 could lead to a test of this fall?s uptrend line crossing near 1110.50 later this year. Momentum indicators are overbought warning investors that additional long-liquidation is possible into the end of November.  The Dow closed lower on Wednesday due to profit taking ahead of the Thanksgiving Day holiday. Ideas that this fall?s rebound might have been too much too fast is causing investors to look hard at their portfolio?s as they might want to lock in profits ahead of the upcoming Christmas season. This morning?s consumer confidence report showed improvement for the second month in a row, which had little effect on investors today. If today?s setback continues, broken fib resistance crossing at 9706.20 is a possible target later this month.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  December T-bonds renewed its decline off November?s high and broke out below the 75% retracement level of the Sept./Oct. rally crossing at 104-29. Today?s close into new lows for the week sets the stage for a likely test of September?s low crossing at 102-17 later this month. A short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today?s losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into the end of November.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index closed higher on Wednesday as it spiked above last week?s high before profit taking tempered some of today?s gains. Strength in energies, grains, fiber and some foods underpinned today?s rally. If this fall?s rebound continues, trendline resistance crossing near 191.87 is the CRB?s next target. Closes above this resistance level are needed to confirm a major bottom and trend change has taken place.   ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed slightly lower on Wednesday in light pre-holiday trading as they consolidated some of this week?s short covering gains. Traders continue to mull over comments from OPEC and non-OPEC nations for a clue on whether or not they will reach an agreement to cut production.  January crude oil closed slightly lower as it posted a quiet inside day on Wednesday to consolidate recent gains. If this week?s rebound continues, fib resistance crossing at 20.02 is Jan.?s next target. Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-December.  December heating oil posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday as it consolidated some of its recent gains. However, momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that Monday?s low marked a short-term bottom. If this week?s rebound continues, fib resistance crossing at 58.36 is December?s next target.   December unleaded gas closed slightly lower on Wednesday in choppy trading. If this week?s rebound continues, fib resistance crossing at 55.55 is December?s next target. Momentum indicators have turned bullish increasing the odds that a short-term top has likely been posted.   December Henry Hub natural gas closed lower on Wednesday following the release of this week?s AGA inventory report. The report showed a build of 15 bcf this past week, which was termed bearish. However, short-term momentum indicators are turning bullish hinting that a double bottom has likely been posted.   CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The December Dollar erased Tuesday?s loss and closed into new highs thereby confirming the recent breakout above trading range resistance. December is poised to test the 62% retracement level of this summer's decline crossing at 117.79 in the near future. Momentum indicators are bullish but becoming overbought but have not confirmed a top is in place.   The December Swiss Franc closed lower on Wednesday due to light profit taking as it consolidated some of Tuesday?s gains. However, closes above trendline resistance crossing near .6136 are needed to confirm a bottom. Momentum indicators are turning neutral to bullish hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-December.  The December Canadian Dollar extended Tuesday?s decline and is poised to retest this month?s low at .6230 in the near future. If the decline resumes, .6200 is a potential target later this year. A number of momentum indicators are turning bearish with today?s decline signaling that additional weakness is possible near-term.   The December Japanese Yen posted a downside reversal on Wednesday thereby ending Tuesday?s short covering bounce. If the decline resumes, July?s low crossing at .8060 is a potential target later this year. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible near-term.  PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  December gold closed slightly lower on Wednesday ended above August?s reaction low crossing at 272.60. Closes below this key support level would open the door for a possible test of this summer?s crossing at 268.40 later this year. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into the end of November.   December silver posted a new contract low on Wednesday as it broke out below key support crossing at 4.055 cents. The door is open for a test of weekly support crossing at 3.90 later this year. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible near-term.   December copper posted a key reversal up on Wednesday. However, today?s mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading when the market reopens after Thanksgiving. Closes above 69.60 or below 66.70 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March corn closed steady on Wednesday as it consolidates below the bottom of October?s gap crossing at 2.21 1/2. Closes above this resistance level are needed to extend March?s rebound off this month?s low and set the stage for a possible test of this summer?s downtrend line crossing near 2.25. Closes above this downtrend line are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of November.   March wheat closed fractionally higher on Wednesday as early strength due to short covering faded ahead of the close. Today?s low-range close leaves the door open for sideways to lower prices on Friday. Until export demand improves, upside potential appears limited into the end of the year. Stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish signaling that a test of October?s high at 3.03 is still possible by the end of the year.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  January soybeans posted an inside day with a higher close on Wednesday due to short covering as it consolidated some of Tuesday?s loss. Friday?s export sales report holds the key as to how January will close out the week. Thin holiday trading volume could lead to exaggerated moves in Friday?s shortened session. Closes above this week?s high at 4.54 3/4 or below this fall?s shallow uptrend line, which crosses near 4.42 1/2 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Momentum indicators are overbought and turned bearish while weekly momentum indicators suggest that additional short covering gains are possible into the end of the year.   January soybean meal closed higher on Wednesday due to short covering following Tuesday?s above mid-range close. January finished the day near mid-range leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are likely into early-December. January remains locked in a sideways pattern, as closes above 162 or below 154.40 are needed to confirm a trading range breakout and point the direction of the next trending move.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  February hogs closed lower on Wednesday following Tuesday?s bearish monthly cold storage report. However, a short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today?s losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Momentum indicators are turning neutral to bearish hinting that sideways to lower prices are possible into early- December.  February cattle closed steady on Wednesday and remain poised to test this fall?s downtrend line crossing near 70.30. Closes above this resistance level are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-December.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  March coffee closed higher on Wednesday in choppy trading as it extended Tuesday?s short covering bounce. Closes above 53.00 or below this fall?s uptrend line crossing near 48.60 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Short-term momentum indicators remain bearish warning bullish traders to use caution, as the market remains vulnerable to additional weakness near-term.  March cocoa closed lower on Wednesday as it continues to consolidate some of this month?s impressive gains. This week?s setback appears to be nothing more than a retest of broken resistance crossing at 1257. Closes above 1297 would confirm this week?s breakout and open the door for a possible test of the March 1999 reaction high crossing at 1341 later this year. The daily ADX is bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of November.   March sugar posted a key reversal up on Wednesday but fell just short of testing the 50% retracement level of the June/October decline crossing at 755. Additional strength is needed to confirm today?s bullish reversal pattern. If this fall?s rally continues, September?s reaction high crossing at 780 is a potential target later this year. The daily ADX has entered a bullish trend mode signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year.  March cotton closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to improving world cotton prices. March needs to close above 37.40 or below 35.00 to clear up near-term direction in the market. If this fall?s short-covering rally resumes, the 50% retracement level of the July/October decline crossing at 37.88 is March?s next target. Momentum indicators are bullish but overbought warning bullish traders to use caution.

I just want to take a minute and tell you what a terrific  job you all are doing there at INO.com.   A while back I asked my broker if there was some way to get  current, Intraday price updates on their otherwise very  good on-line system. He said ?No?.  Then said, ?Wait a  minute- try INO.com, they can give you 10 and 30-minute  updates at no charge.?   Well, it's been an enlightening experience every day since.  While the Lee Gettess product didn't work out for me, the  John Crane Reversal Day product is proving very insightful  and was the catalyst for a few successful trades this week.   I look forward to my morning, evening and weekly extreme  market updates and I plan to shop at the INO store on many  occasions in the future to take advantage of the many  excellent educational opportunities there.   My 'Portfolio' and 'Quote Board' window allow me to draw a  much sharper bulls-eye and hit my upside targets with much  greater accuracy than in the past. I've been trading for a  few years now and have always enjoyed it, but you've injected  a new vitality and brought a new life to the markets for me.   Just yesterday, when exiting a long Bean position for a  modest but appreciated profit I thanked my broker for  turning me on to INO.com and I meant it.   You all are doing a bang-up job and I personally think a  lot of 'dotcom' start up outfits could do a lot worse than  to take a look at your approach and the way you cater to  your clientele.   Keep up the good work, it's greatly appreciated.   - Chris N., Hawaii November 17, 2001 _____________________________________________________________________  <4> POWERFUL NEW (and FREE!)

The Dow Jones  Industrial Average closed at 9,959.71, up 125.03, on Friday  and traders will be watching to see if it can climb above  the psychologically-important 10,000 mark. In a quiet  commodities sector, short-covering and firm cash markets  propelled Cattle and Hog futures higher, while tight  supplies and supportive technicals boosted Sugar to a nine- week peak. Grains and Soy products were generally quiet and  little changed, although Soyoil enjoyed a sharp gain. Crude  Oil sagged amid a standoff on production cuts, while Silver  continued to lose its shine and dipped to an eight-year low.   - Alex McCallum, Editorial Director & Forum Moderator  _____________________________________________________________________  <2> FREE Chicago Board of Trade Video! _____________________________________________________________________  Trading Futures & Options on the Dow Jones Indices  FREE - CLICK HERE: http://www.ino.com/specials/firstfid/cbotvideo.html  <a href=""http://www.ino.com/specials/firstfid/cbotvideo.html"">FREE Dow Jones VIDEO!</a>  _____________________________________________________________________  <3> LARRY WILLIAMS ON SHORT TERM TRADING - NEW ! ! ! http://store.ino.com/sale/1E78A/INLST-LarryOnShort  _____________________________________________________________________   SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: The 20th Century's World Champion Trader  Finally Reveals His Amazing Secrets In 2001!

Now Revealed In This Complete Trading Course  For Just A Small, No-Risk Investment   World Famous ?Turtle? Commodity Trading Method  . . . Now Available To You   On Video And In Clear Trading Lessons  In The Privacy Of Your Home  . . . At A VERY Affordable Low, Low Price!!  Fifteen years ago, one futures trader stunned the entire trading  world as he methodically turned $400 into over $200,000,000  trading futures. In 1983, he personally taught his trading  strategies and systems to 14 people he nicknamed ?The Turtles.?  In the next five years, the Turtles earned some $35,000,000 as  their percent of profits from the $175 million profit they made  for their teacher (who bankrolled their trading)!  Yes, those zeroes are correct.  As a group, the ?Turtles? have been trading now for over 14 years  and currently manage $2,000,000,000 (2 BILLION dollars) given to  them from people and institutions all over the world. Estimated  profits for the 16 months ending this past April are over  $300,000,000 (that's 300 million dollars actual, documented  profits!)  Even now - 14 years later - five of the world's top 10 futures  money managers are Turtle traders! _____________________________________________________________________   READ OUR VALUABLE 16 PAGE  ONLINE BROCHURE NOW BY VISITING:  http://store.ino.com/sale/1E78A/TWTSN-TurtleSecrets   <a href=""http://store.ino.com/sale/1E78A/TWTSN-TurtleSecrets"">Turtle Trading System Revealed!</a> _____________________________________________________________________  Now You Can Learn The Turtle Trading System And Strategy  In An Exciting Personal Trading Course - In Your Living Room   Yours for more profitable trading,   J.

"I agree that we should not move the business at this time, but we do need cross-training to occur.  Eventually the business should come here to Houston.  The decision was made to bring the physical trading business to the Houston office and I do not believe that that task has been completed.  My feelings are for continuity that all operations involving trading and scheduling of physical gas should move here under your firm control and direction.  I also think that some of our counterparties are confused as to who to call concerning these types of deals and that trading decisions are being made in Denver without our knowledge until after the fact.  This is something that I have heard from you and Barry that should not be happening.  I would still like to go to Denver for the cross-training to occur and we can determine the eventual placement of these operations after things calm down.  Jay   -----Original Message----- From:  Grigsby, Mike   Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 2:36 PM To: Reitmeyer, Jay Subject: Denver  In light of the current circumstances with the company and the concerns that our counterparties have at this time, I would like to leave the upstream business in Denver.  Moving this business would lead to confusion with our customers and to our Denver based employees.  Let me know if you have any issues with this.  If you would like to go up there for coordination and training, then feel free to travel to Denver.

"Patti Sullivan informed me that the Logistics group performed a PRC last week and ranked Elizabeth Shim to be fired from Enron.  I do not believe Elizabeth Shim is there employee to rank for termination.  Until last week, Elizabeth Shim was in the Trading Track program on loan to Bob Hall and logistics.  If they were trying to meet quota by terminating Elizabeth, then I think they need to look elsewhere.  The Trading group should be making the decision on whether or not we fire Trading Track employees.

We got approximately $297MM in cash up front, with delivery obligations at various delivery points, including NNG-Demarc, Rockies, TW-SJ, NIT, Topock and Sumas over the life of the deal.

Roger Mock said that on Saturday he received a call from Kevin Brady notifying APEA that deliveries on Northern were being cut.  The documentation allows for some delivery point flexibility, should alternative delivery points be better for us at this time.

U.S. housing starts rose 8.2% for November to a seasonally-adjusted 1.645 million annual rate. This followed a revised 4.0% fall in October to a 1.521 million annual rate. October starts were previously reported as sliding 1.3% to a 1.552 million annual rate. The readings were much stronger than economists' expectations.  That data added to an already positive tone present in equity Markets overnight thanks to encouraging news out of Circuit City and Best Buy. Circuit City reported third-quarter earnings at 10 cents a share. That was 3 cents better than analysts had been expecting. Circuit City stock jumped over a full point on that news before pulling back later in the session. Best Buy posted 37 cent third quarter earnings, beating analysts' expectations by one cent.   Chicago Mercantile Exchange stock index futures traders attributed a late morning dip in prices to some independent traders losing confidence that institutional players - such as Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs - which had been on the buy side early in the session, would continue to support the market with their orders. The downtick was further fueled when light sell stops were triggered under 1654.00 in the March Nasdaq futures contract. However, the contracts ended just about at the top of their day ranges Tuesday. Analysts said continued thin trade in equity futures contracts likely magnified movement. Resistance for the March S&P futures contract is now seen at the psychological resistance level of 1150.00. Support is seen at Friday's low of 1115.80. Resistance for March Nasdaq is seen at 1674.00, the 50% retracement level from Dec. 6. Support is seen at 1596.00, Friday's low.  INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The U.S. Treasury market squirreled away Modest Gains Tuesday, in a quiet session that stood in stark contrast with Monday's fireworks. At 3:45 p.m EST, the 10-year Treasury note stood at 99 1/32, up 13/32 to yield 5.13%. The 30-year Treasury gained 14/32 to 97 28/32, yielding 5.52%. The five-year price gained 7/32 to a 4.42% yield, while the two-year price was up 2/32 at a yield of 3.09%.  As it was on Monday, the market was all about light flows and a lack of participation ahead of the Christmas holiday and year-end, a condition that traditionally befalls the market this time of year. ""I think the only thing in common"" between the two trading sessions ""is light flows,"" said Michael Cloherty, market strategist with Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. ""That's one of the things that pushed the market so far yesterday - liquidity is pretty poor.""  In battening down the hatches, many dealers and investors are seeking to protect profits ahead of the year-end. But there's also a sentiment that news on the economy is mixed right now, and that that's limiting the participation of some, market participants said.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  No report today.  ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Crude oil futures ended steady and most gasoline futures contracts rose modestly Tuesday, while heating oil futures posted moderate gains at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Heating oil futures briefly surged nearly 2 cents amid strength in the US East and Gulf Coast cash markets as refinery selling waned. Upcoming colder weather in the Northeast, the largest heating oil market in the country, may have provided another boost. ""We can only guess that it is some reaction to Monday afternoon's National Weather Service short-term outlooks showing below-normal temperatures for the Northeast in both the 6-10 and 8-14 day editions,"" said Tim Evans, analyst at IFR Pegasus. Gasoline futures traded on middle ground as refiners are seen curbing gasoline production but demand is seen lackluster.   HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--The natural gas futures contract eased into the mid-$2.60s a million British thermal units Tuesday, as another day of anticipated winter cold fell off the calendar. ""You don't need just cold weather, you need an Ice Age,"" said Ed Kennedy of Pioneer Futures Inc. in Miami. January settled at $2.657/MMBtu, down 2.9 cents, trading in a 12-cent range from $2.63-$2.75/MMBtu. February fell 4.9 cents to $2.712/MMBtu. Looking ahead, expect that slow, sinking feeling to continue well into January's expiration, traders said.   CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The dollar tread water against the euro and edged only slightly higher against the yen Tuesday, after some traders questioned whether the rally in the dollar/yen and euro/yen pairs over recent sessions may have been too much, too soon. Having jumped to a fresh three-year high of Y128.43 during Asian trading, the dollar slipped back as some market participants began to factor in the likelihood that the Bank of Japan won't implement any major new monetary initiatives at its two-day policy meeting, that concludes Wednesday.   The euro slid as low as Y114.91 at one point, well off its intraday high of Y115.95. Even so, some analysts do expect some sort of policy change from the BOJ and many market watchers think the dollar is still set to move higher against the yen.   PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Precious metals settled mixed Tuesday, with gold futures rallying on fund buying and gathering enough momentum to penetrate the key resistance area around $280 an ounce and silver also flexed its technical muscle. Lack of sellers into the gains helped the yellow metal accelerate upward, breaking through $280 and tripping buy-stops above there, according to Refco Inc. analyst Jim Steel.   The March silver contract on Comex also mustered the strength to break above resistance Tuesday, finishing 5.5 cents higher at $4.42 an ounce. No one still has any idea what's driving the rise in silver lease rates, but Steel said he doubted people were borrowing just to sell into the recent strength, as he hadn't seen evidence of selling on the longer end of the curve.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Chicago Board of Trade corn and wheat futures settled lower Tuesday mostly on spillover pressure by the soybean market and on a late sell-off by locals and speculators. After a lackluster, dull session corn and wheat futures sank to new session lows about 15 minutes before the closing bell. ""It was very slow in here until the last 15-20 minutes,"" said Victor Lespinasse, a grain trader with A.G. Edwards in Chicago. ""Corn and wheat came down in sympathy with beans.""   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--After a two-sided, dull session Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures closed lower Tuesday on a late technical sell-off. January soybean futures tumbled within 3.50 cents of the contract low. ""It was a technical break,"" said one floor trader.  Soybeans garnered some strength earlier from large commercial buying and ideas hot/dry weather in Argentina could hurt the quality of the crop there. Floor brokers said ADM bought between 700-900 contracts of January soybeans and Cargill bought 500 contracts. Market watchers said commercials were the best scale down buyers in soybeans and oil.  Soy meal futures collapsed late in the session to post solid losses in sympathy with the weak soybean market and on widespread selling by the speculators. Soy oil was the leader to the downside earlier in the session, according to floor brokers. ""The sell-off started in the soy products, which led to a general sell-off,"" said Victor Lespinasse, a grain trader with A.G. Edwards.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures ended at or near limit-up levels Tuesday, as talk spread in the trading pit that Mother Nature's winter wrath would soon be felt in some of the nation's major cattle feeding areas. The soon-to-expire December contract ended up the $1.50 per/hundredweight limit, hitting a nearly one-week high. The most-actively traded February contract surged to a two-week peak, while April climbed to a three-week high. Each contract finished 2.5 cents below the limit price. The bullish sentiment spilled over to feeder cattle futures, which ended limit-up in almost every contract.   Lean hog and pork belly futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ended mostly lower Tuesday in a light-volume day as the market faced uncertainties over cash hog values for the remainder of the week. The market had a relatively bearish tone at the open when the market failed Monday to move above a key resistance level of $53.70. Sell stops were tripped in February below $52.90 - around Monday's low. Another damping effect was Monday's low cattle kills of only 103,000 head versus 125,00 a week earlier. Tuesday's kill was 124,000.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Arabica coffee futures on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange settled lower Tuesday in an extension of the selling wave that started on Monday, traders said. The bearish tone of the market was set from the opening bell, with prices leaning to the downside on perceptions that the reported drawdown on Green Coffee Association's stocks was too low.  Cocoa futures settled lower Tuesday after a late bout of hedge selling kept the market near the session's low. The move was called a ""corrective"" pullback by some participants, but it wasn't expected to alter the market's long-term bullish outlook. Cocoa prices whipsawed for the first half of the session in very thin volume, with early long liquidation weighing on prices. Once that quieted down, some short covering by locals briefly pushed the most-active March contract into positive terrain until renewed light selling emerged.   World March raw sugar futures closed at a six-week low Tuesday after a dramatic trading session, which featured a massive amount of technical selling by funds. The market began weaker off the back of heavy selling in the Liffe market. Locals and small speculators sold the market down to 7.15 cents, which is where funds sell-stops kicked-in, and then a downward spiral ensued. After the market hit a low of 7.02 cents a pound, locals and speculators started short covering, but the rally was short lived and selling once agaiin took charge of the market. Final volume was estimated at a hefty 33,000 lots.   After a listless session, cotton futures on the New York Cotton Exchange settled lower Tuesday in what some participants described as a consolidation move. The market opened modestly lower in light trade selling, and the most active March contract floated within a relatively tight trading range for most of the session.

The NASDAQ closed lower on Wednesday on ideas that some of the tech stocks have become overvalues, which triggered a round of profit taking by investors. Additional pressure came from news that Motorola will trim its job force by another 9,400 jobs. Closes above last week?s high at 2036.54 would temper the bearish outlook for the NASDAQ and could lead to sideways to higher prices into the end of the year. Closes below 1898.80 would open the door for a larger-degree decline into early- January. The March S&P 500 index closed higher for the fourth day in a row on Wednesday as it continues to rebounded off the 25% retracement level of this fall?s rally crossing at 1120.66. However, it will take closes above December's high at 1176 to renew this fall's rally. Until then, I would not be surprised to see March trade sideways into the end of the year.   The Dow closed higher for the third day in a row on Wednesday. Support came from better-than-expected leading economic indicators for November. The Dow has fought back from last week's low and is poised to test broken trendline support and the 62% retracement level of the May/September decline crossing at 10,094.10. Closes above these two resistance levels are needed to renew this fall's rally.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  March T-bonds extended their rebound off Monday's on Wednesday and is challenging trendline resistance drawn across the Nov./Dec. highs, which crosses near 101-16. Support came from better-than-expected leading economic indicators for November. Multiple closes above the aforementioned downtrend line are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change. Momentum indicators are diverging and have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year. However, I would not be surprised to see a pause if not minor setback on Thursday as March may try to consolidate some of this week's short covering gains ahead of the Christmas Holiday.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index closed lower for the third day in a row on Wednesday due to weakness in meats, precious metals, fiber and natural gas. Today's low fell short of retesting this fall's uptrend line. Closes above 193.39 or below 187.73 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible into the end of the year.  ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed higher on Wednesday following Tuesday's API inventory reports, which were supportive to the markets. The reports showed that crude oil stocks rose by 929,000 barrels last week. Distillate stocks including heating oil declined by 1.011 million barrels and gasoline stocks fell by 873,000 barrels last week. Additional support came from expectations for a cold snap in U.S. weather to begin shortly after the first of the new year.  February crude oil extended this week's breakout above the fall?s downtrend while opening the door for a test of the early-December high crossing at 21.05 later this winter. Closes above this resistance level could lead to a test of the 38% retracement level of this fall's decline, which crosses at 21.77. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible.  February heating oil closed higher on Wednesday but fell just short of testing the early-December high crossing at 57.85. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term. Closes above this resistance level would open the door for a larger-degree rebound into early-January. Today's rally was supported by the latest API inventor report that showed a 1.011 million-barrel decline in U.S. stocks last week. With forecasts calling for colder weather for the East Coast by early-January, additional short-covering gains are possible into the end of the year.  February unleaded gas spiked above the early-December high of 57.62 on Wednesday following Tuesday's friendly API inventory report. Profit taking ahead of the close tempered some of today's gains leaving the door open for sideways trading on Thursday. However, momentum indicators are bullish signaling that additional strength is possible into the end of the year. Closes above 57.62 would set the stage for a test of November's gap crossing at 59.80 in the near future.   February Henry Hub natural gas closed lower on Wednesday ahead of the release of this week's AGA inventory report. Low consumer demand due to above normal temps across the high demand regions of the U.S. along with lower industrial demand continues to weigh on prices. Closes above the Oct./Nov. downtrend line or below December's low at 2.58 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Short- term momentum indicators are turning neutral to bearish hinting that sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of the year.   CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The March Dollar gapped up and closed higher on Wednesday as it extends this week's short covering rebound. Closes above gap resistance crossing at 116.55 are needed to temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are oversold and turning bullish signaling that a low was likely posted with Monday's spike below the 50% retracement level of the Sept./Nov. rally crossing at 115.42.   The March Swiss Franc closed lower on Wednesday. Early weakness spiked below minor trendline support drawn across last week's low. A short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's loss allowing March to close at minor trendline support crossing at .6105. Additional weakness is needed to turn short-term momentum indicators bearish. Closes above .6182 would open the door for a larger-degree rebound into January.  The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Wednesday thereby confirming Tuesday's breakout below the Nov./Dec. uptrend line. Session lows spiked below the 38% retracement level of November's rally crossing at .6342. I would not be surprised to see a short covering bounce on Thursday as March might try to consolidate some of this week's losses. At the same time, momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January.   The March Japanese Yen closed lower on Wednesday as it continues to drift lower following the recent breakout below weekly support crossing at .7903. If the decline continues, monthly fib support crossing at .7568 is the next target later this winter. The daily ADX signals that additional weakness is possible. It would take closes above November?s downtrend line crossing near .7990 to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place.  PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  February gold closed sharply lower on Wednesday due to profit taking, which was triggered by a firmer U.S. Dollar. Today's close below the early-December high crossing at 278.70 strongly suggests that the initial short covering rebound off last week's low has likely come to an end. Stochastics and the RSI are turning neutral to bearish with today's loss warning traders that additional weakness into the end of December is possible.   March silver posted a huge key reversal down on Wednesday after early strength led to a spike above the 50% retracement level crossing at 4.423. Today's sharp decline and low-range close sets the stage for additional long- liquidation on Thursday. March closed below initial trendline support crossing near 4.34 thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top has been posted. Stochastics and the RSI have also turned bearish from overbought levels signaling that additional long-liquidation appears likely into the end of the year.   March copper closed higher on Wednesday due to light short covering ahead of the close. March continues to consolidate above December's broken downtrend line as it is trying to solidify a bottom. Short-term momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that additional short covering gains are possible into the end of the year.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March corn closed fractionally higher on Wednesday due to spillover support from sharply higher wheat prices. However, the corn market remains paralyzed by the uncertainty of which supply/demand scenario will play out in 2002. With export demand still running below the pace needed to reach this year's USDA projection, bulls are having a tough go of trying to build a case for higher prices anytime soon. Traders are not expecting any major surprises in Thursday's supply/demand report, as light pre-holiday trading volume will likely leave March corn range bound between 2.23 and 2.10 1/4 into January.  March wheat closed sharply higher on Wednesday as news that China purchased 200,000 metric tonnes of U.S. wheat triggered fund buying that pushed it above minor resistance crossing at 2.90 1/2. While light profit taking ahead of the close tempered some of today's gains, March is poised to test this fall's downtrend line crossing near 2.95 later this month. Closes above this resistance level would open the door for a likely test of October's high crossing at 3.03 later this winter. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  January soybeans closed higher on Wednesday leaving Tuesday's key reversal down unconfirmed. Talk that China bought about 15,000 tonnes of U.S. soybean oil triggered today's short covering rebound. Traders will pay close attention to Thursday's export sales report, which needs to remain strong in order to keep the bean market from falling any lower this winter. Closes above the Nov./Dec. downtrend line crossing near 4.41 3/4 are needed before a short-term bottom can be confirmed. Until then, the door remains open for a possible test of this fall's low crossing at 4.26 1/2. Short-term momentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that a low might be near.  January soybean meal posted an inside day with a higher close due to spillover support from bean oil, beans and wheat. Today's rally left Tuesday's key reversal down unconfirmed. If the fall decline resumes, the late-May low crossing at 146 is a possible target later this month. Closes above 152 would temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  February hogs closed lower on Wednesday as futures prices, which is premium to the cash market, are trying to realign themselves. Additional pressure came from light position squaring ahead of the release of the USDA's monthly cold storage report on Thursday. Trading is likely to move into a holding pattern ahead of the quarterly hogs and pigs' report due to be released on December 28th. Cash bids are called steady for Thursday, which should support a steady to firmer opening tomorrow. Momentum indicators are neutral to bullish hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible near- term.   February cattle posted an inside day with a lower close due to light profit taking as traders began to position themselves ahead of Friday's cattle-on-feed report. This month's decline ahead of the report suggests that the market has already discounted any bearish news into prices. Expectations for a possible lull in marketings in early- January as cattle were pulled forward due to mild weather conditions this fall should help support February cattle into early-January barring a bearish report on Friday. Closes above Tuesday's high at 69.57 would open the door for a larger-degree rebound this winter.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  March coffee closed higher on Wednesday due to light short covering as it consolidated some of this week's loss. Early strength filled Monday's gap at 47.40. However, a late sell off ahead of the close tempered some of today's gains. While exchange stocks continue to shrink, Brazil's massive crop now growing continues to trigger producer selling on rallies. Short-term momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of the year. Closes below this month's low crossing at 44.75 would renew this year?s decline while setting the stage for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40-cents later this winter.  March cocoa gapped down and closed lower on Wednesday due to producer hedging and light speculator selling. The upper range close leaves the door open for a possible short covering bounce on Thursday. From a broader perspective, March needs to close above November?s high at 1365 or below last week's low at 1212 to clear up near-term direction in the market. The ability to hold at current levels in the height of its supply period with the African main harvest advancing underscores the firm tone underneath the market.   March sugar closed lower on Wednesday and below the 50% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 698. Today's sell off was triggered by long-liquidation by funds. However, I would not be surprised to see a short covering bounce on Thursday as March might try to consolidate some of its recent losses. Longer-term, I am looking for March to try and test November's low at 661. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.   March cotton gapped down and closed lower on Wednesday. However, a short covering rally ahead of the close tempered much of today's loss leaving the door open for additional short covering on Thursday if this week's export sales report is bullish. Closes above the Nov./Dec. downtrend line crossing near 37.45 are needed to confirm a bottom has been posted.

From the paper this morning, it looks like that you will be auctions to the highest bidder.  It is kind of sad.    I am currently working out of Enron's out placement service in Allen III.

The next time you go down there in the future, please come by and see our place.  We are on Fulton Beach Road just north of Trailor Inn By The Bay.

Additional pressure was due to profit taking ahead of the Christmas holiday. The NASDAQ closed sharply lower on Thursday and below last week's low of 1934.60 and is poised to test the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 1905.53 possibly on Friday. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. The March S&P 500 index also closed lower on Thursday due to light profit taking triggered by a number of earnings warnings and Congresses inability to pass an economic stimulus package before Christmas. Bulls were encouraged as March remained within Wednesday's trading range thereby leaving the door open for additional short covering possibly into the end of the year.   The Dow posted an inside day with a lower close on Thursday due to light profit taking ahead of the Christmas Day holiday. Additional pressure came from a earnings and revenue warning from Juniper Networks causing some concern over the recent rally in technology stocks. News that Congress will not likely pass an economic stimulus package also weighed on prices. Losses were limited as the latest jobless claims report showed a decline of 11,000 claims to 384,000.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  March T-bonds closed slightly lower on Thursday but ended above trendline resistance drawn across the Nov./Dec. highs, which crosses near 101-05. Multiple closes above this downtrend line and broken support crossing at 101-22 are needed to confirm today's trendline breakout. Support came from the latest jobless claims report, which showed a decline of 11,000 to 384,000. Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year. I would not be surprised to see subdued trading on Friday as many traders will have already left to celebrate Christmas early.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index closed modestly higher on Thursday due to strength in hogs, precious metals, some foods, and natural gas. Today's rebound ended a two-day sell off from Monday's high. However, the mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Closes above 193.39 or below 187.73 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible into the end of the year.  ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed lower on Thursday with the exception of natural gas. Today's weakness appears to be due to profit taking ahead of Christmas, as many traders will start the weekend early taking Friday off. Trading is likely to remain subdued ahead of OPEC's upcoming meeting next week when they will decide whether or not to go ahead with their announce production cut of 1.5 million barrels per day. Non- OPEC countries combined cuts are fast approaching the 500,000 barrel per day production cut needed for OPEC to enact their own cuts.   February crude oil posted a key reversal down on Thursday due to light profit taking. Early strength failed to exceed Wednesday's high of 20.18, which triggered the sell off into the close. Additional weakness on Friday would confirm today's bearish reversal pattern that could lead to a test of recent lows crossing at 18.20. Trading is likely to remain subdued ahead of next week's OPEC meeting.   February heating oil posted a key reversal down on Thursday after a spike above the early-December high crossing at 57.85 failed to attract additional buying. The low-range close on Thursday sets the stage for follow-through selling due to light profit taking ahead of Christmas on Friday. Trading volume will be low as many traders are expected to start the Christmas weekend on Friday. A lower close on Friday would signal that a double top may have been posted with today's high.   February unleaded gas also posted a key reversal down on Thursday due to profit taking after spiking above the early- December high of 57.62. Early strength failed to trigger new buying so traders dumped their long positions ahead of the Christmas holiday weekend. Additional weakness on Friday would turn the near-term trend sideways ahead of next week's much anticipated OPEC meeting.   February Henry Hub natural gas closed higher due to short covering on Thursday despite Wednesday's slightly negative AGA weekly inventory report. The report showed a draw of 44 billion cubic feet from U.S. stocks last week, which was below expectations, due in part to above normal temps across large portions of high demand regions of the country and continued weakness from industry. Closes above 2.94 or below December's low at 2.58 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.   CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The March Dollar closed higher on Thursday but near session lows due to a late round of profit taking. Early strength tested last week's gap beginning at 11.46 before buying dried up. The low-range close leaves the door open for additional profit taking ahead of Christmas on Friday. Closes above gap resistance crossing at 116.55 would signal that a larger-degree rebound is possible into January. Stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish signaling that additional gains are possible.   The March Swiss Franc closed higher on Thursday due to light short covering. Closes above Monday's high at .6154 are needed to renew March's rebound off December's low. At the same time stochastics and the RSI are nearing their respective overbought zones hinting that a test of November's high crossing at .6182 is possible however, time is no longer on their side. If this resistance level is tested in the near-future, it would likely mark a short-term top, defining the upper boundary of this winter's trading range.   The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Thursday and below the 38% retracement level of November's rally crossing at .6342. Today's decline sets the stage for a likely test of December's reaction low crossing at .6325 possibly before the end of the year. Momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January.   The March Japanese Yen continues to decline off November's high and remains poised to eventually test monthly fib support crossing at .7568 later this winter. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible. Closes above November?s downtrend line crossing near .7972 are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place.  PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  February gold posted a quiet inside day with a higher close on Thursday due to short covering as it consolidated some of Wednesday's loss. While another day or two of consolidation above Wednesday's low is possible, stochastics and the RSI have turned neutral to bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. Closes above 283.30 or below 271.70 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.   March silver closed higher on Thursday leaving Wednesday's key reversal down unconfirmed. Today's rebound leaves March poised to test the 50% retracement level crossing at 4.423. Closes above this resistance level are needed to keep the rally off November's low alive. At the same time, stochastics and the RSI are very overbought warning traders to use caution as a short-term top appears to be in or is near.  March copper closed higher on Thursday as it continues to consolidate above the 50% retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50 and above December's broken downtrend line. Short-term momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year. If this month's decline resumes, the 62% retracement level crossing at 66.04 is a potential target.  GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March corn closed lower on Thursday following this morning's disappointing export sales report, which showed net sales of only 23.7 million bushels. Additional pressure came from uncertainty over China's grain policies and conflicting data regarding their ending stocks level. Trading volume continues to dry up ahead of the extended Christmas Holiday weekend, which leaves the market vulnerable to test its contract low at 2.10 1/4 on Friday. Stochastics and the RSI remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are still possible into early-January. Closes below the contract low would open the door for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this winter.   March wheat closed sharply lower on Thursday erasing almost all of Wednesday's gains. The reason for today's sell off was a lack of confirmation about Wednesday's announced sale to China. Additional pressure was triggered when Cargill was a featured seller of wheat today. This week's back and fill type trading is often typical ahead of the Christmas Holiday and the end of the year due to reduced trading volume. While momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year, it will take closes above the Nov./Dec. downtrend line crossing near 2.95 to temper the bearish outlook in the market.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  January soybeans closed fractionally higher on Thursday following another strong weekly export sales report. The report showed net soybean sales of 36.6 million bushels. However, gains were limited due to weakness in corn and wheat. While demand remains strong for U.S. soybeans, the market is becoming increasingly concerned that South American supplies will soon cut in to U.S. export business. Without any major weather problems down south, I am looking for soybeans to continue to drift sideways to lower into January.  January soybean meal closed higher on Thursday following another strong weekly export sales report. The report showed net sales of 142,400 metric tonnes. Closes above last Friday's high crossing at 151.90 would temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are diverging and have turned bullish with today's rally hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year.  LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  February hogs posted an upside reversal on Thursday hinting that the setback off Monday's high might have come to an end. A higher close on Friday is needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern. Today's rally was triggered by talk that packers could raise their cash bids on Friday to fill their needs for what could be a large Saturday kill. Today's rally was limited ahead of this afternoon's monthly cold storage report. The report showed 36.290 million pounds of bellies in storage as of Nov. 30th, which is below pre- report estimates. Early calls are for steady to higher hogs on Friday and higher belly prices following today's friendly cold storage report.   February cattle closed lower on Thursday as news of $62 cash trade in Kansas pressured the market lower. Thursday's decline ate into Tuesday's rally as traders are positioning themselves ahead of Friday's cattle-on-feed report. Momentum indicators remain bullish but will need to see renewed strength soon or risk rolling over into bearish modes when trading resumes next week.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  March coffee closed into new highs for the month on Thursday thereby renewing this month's short covering rally. Session highs filled November's gap at 49.60 thereby opening the door for a larger-degree rebound into January. Today's rally was due to year-end short covering by funds and small speculators. Light support came from news that the Central American harvest remains slow and part of that coffee crop will go unpicked due to current low prices. Stochastics and the RSI remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year. November's high crossing at 53.00 is March's next target.   March cocoa closed lower on Thursday in relatively quiet trading following Wednesday's gap down and lower close. Momentum indicators have turned bearish with this week's setback thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top is in place. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Closes below last week's low crossing at 1212 would open the door for a larger-degree decline into January.   March sugar closed higher on Thursday due to light short covering following Wednesday's close below the 50% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 698. However, buying dried up late in the session, which led to a mid-range close. Sideways trading is possible on Friday however, momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. I am looking for March to try and test November's low at 661 later this winter.   March cotton posted an inside day with a lower close on Thursday following a disappointing export sales report. Traders were looking for export sales to range from 200,000 to 250,000 bales. However, the report came in showing sales of only 169,900 bales. Fallout from Wednesday's upward revised Chinese crop estimate also weighed on prices. This week's setback has turned stochastics and the RSI bearish again signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of the year. Closes above 37.60 or below 34.91 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.

The NASDAQ closed higher on Friday as it continues to consolidate above the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 1905.53. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. The March S&P 500 index also closed higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead of Christmas. Bulls remain encouraged by this week's short covering rebound off the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 1120.66. However, closes above December's high crossing at 1176 are needed to renew this fall's rally. Until then, March may decide to correct more in time than price, which would be long-term bullish.  The Dow posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday due to light bargain hunting buying ahead of the Christmas holiday weekend. Gains were limited following a downward revision of the third quarter GDP to -1.3% from the previous estimate of -1.1%. Additional pressure came from weak consumer confidence data. Nevertheless, the Dow remains poised to test the 62% retracement level of the May/September decline crossing at 10,094.10 in the near future.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  March T-bonds closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead of the Christmas holiday. A downward revision in economic growth for the third quarter along with weak consumer spending also provided light pressure to the market. Nevertheless, March remained above this fall's downtrend line, which leaves the door open for sideways to higher prices possibly into early-January. Stochastics and the RSI remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term. Closes above last week's high crossing at 102-05 would confirm this week's trendline breakout while opening the door for a larger-degree rebound this winter.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index closed higher on Friday due to strength in livestock, precious metals, fiber, and energies. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible into the end of the year. Today's rally sets the stage for a possible test of this month's high crossing at 193.39. Closes above 193.39 are needed to renew the CRB's rally off October's low.   ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed mostly higher on Friday with the exception of heating oil. Trading volume was limited as many traders decided to kick off the Christmas holiday early. Trading next week is likely to be subdued ahead of next Friday's meeting among OPEC nations at which time they will decide whether or not to proceed with their announced cutback on crude oil production beginning January 1 in an attempt to stabilize sagging energy prices.   February crude oil posted an inside day with a higher close due to light short covering on Friday as it consolidated some of Thursday's losses. February has broken out above this fall's downtrend line leaving it in position to test the early-December high crossing at 21.05 later this winter. Trading is likely to remain subdued ahead of next week's OPEC meeting.   February heating oil closed slightly lower on Friday thereby confirming Thursday's key reversal down. I would not be surprised to see sideways trading extend into the end of the year as traders await OPEC's decision about production next Friday. Closes above this week's high would open the door for a larger-degree rebound into early-January with November's high crossing at 64.35 being a potential target later this winter.   February unleaded gas closed slightly higher due to light short covering on Friday. This week's failed attempt to breakout the early-December high of 57.62 has left a possible double top on the daily chart. Closes above this resistance level would open the door for a possible test of November's gap crossing at 59.80 later this winter. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year.  February Henry Hub natural gas closed sharply higher on Friday as extended weather forecasts are calling for the first major winter storm of the winter to hit portions of the upper Midwest and move eastward beginning this weekend. Today's high fell short of testing last week's high crossing at 2.94. Closes above this resistance level would confirm a breakout above this fall's downtrend line while opening the door for a larger-degree rebound into January.   CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The March Dollar closed sharply higher on Friday and posted a hew high close for December. Short covering ahead of the Christmas holiday triggered today's rally. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that additional gains are possible. While a round of profit taking is possible when trading resumes next week, the stage is set for additional gains into early-January. I am looking for the March Dollar to eventually try and test November's high crossing at 118.27 later this winter.   The March Swiss Franc closed sharply lower on Friday thereby turning short-term momentum indicators bearish signaling that a short-term top has been posted. The nearly flat correction off November's low was one of time instead of price and underscores the weak tone of the market. While a short covering bounce is possible when trading resumes next week, the stage is set for a possible test of this fall's lows by early-January.   The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Friday and tested the 62% retracement level of November's rally crossing at .6300. While a short covering bounce is possible when trading resumes next week, momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. If the decline continues, the 75% retracement level crossing at .6273 is March's next target.   The March Japanese Yen plunged to new contract lows on Friday as it fell to a new three-year low against the U.S. Dollar. The late-week acceleration in this fall's decline leaves the market poised to eventually test monthly fib support crossing at .7568 later this winter. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible. Closes above November?s downtrend line crossing near .7970 are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place.  PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  February gold closed higher on Friday due to short covering triggered by today's sharp rally in the U.S. Dollar. As long as February gold remains above minor trendline support crossing near 276.50 the door remains open for sideways to higher prices into early January with November's high crossing at 283.30 being a potential target. Stochastics and the RSI are holding onto their bullish positions signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early- January.   March silver closed sharply higher on Thursday due in large part year-end short covering. Nevertheless, today's rally led to a close above the 50% retracement level crossing at 4.423 thereby renewing its rally off November's low. While stochastics and the RSI are very overbought, trend-following indicators such as the ADX are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   March copper closed higher on Friday after testing the 50% retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50. March's inability to push below this support level triggered a short covering rally into the close. However, additional strength next week with closes above the reaction high crossing at 69.45 are needed to confirm a bottom has been posted. Short-term momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March corn closed lower on Friday falling just a 1/4-cent short of testing the contract low posted in November. Closes below the contract low at 2.10 1/4 would open the door for additional weakness and a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this winter. Uncertainty over sales policies in Argentina and China along with lagging U.S. export sales, which are running 11% behind last year's sluggish pace continue to pressure the market. Today's sharp rally in the U.S. Dollar along with an increase in cheaper feed-grade wheat also pressured the market. Short-term momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of December.   March wheat closed higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead of the Christmas holiday. Light support came from expectations that this week's huge U.S. wheat sale to China will be confirmed before the end of the year. At the same time gains were limited due to ideas that Argentina will soon devalue its currency and that wheat exports will pick up significantly once this devaluation occurs. Since wheat is on pace to meet USDA export sales, any further sales to China could be extremely supportive to wheat prices as ending stocks will be directly effected. It will take closes above the Nov./Dec. downtrend line crossing near 2.95 to temper the bearish outlook in the market. Until then look for choppy price action to continue.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  January soybeans closed steady on Friday in quiet pre- holiday type trading. I do not see any major pickup in trading volume when traders return from Christmas next week. While demand for U.S. beans remains strong, near ideal growing condition in South America have bears penciling in another record soybean crop. Uncertainty about Argentina's political situation is also limiting near-term gains as they are expected to devalue their currency in the near future. Once this is done, they will likely become aggressive marketers of new crop soybeans once they become available to the market. At the same time, momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral hinting that a short-term bottom might be in or is near. Closes above trendline resistance crossing near 4.41 are needed to confirm a bottom is in place.  January soybean meal closed lower on Friday. Early strength led to a spike above minor resistance crossing at 151.90. However, a lack of follow-through buying triggered a sell off ahead of the close. Nevertheless, short-term momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  February hogs gapped up and closed sharply higher following Thursday's friendly monthly cold storage report confirming Thursday's upside reversal. Spillover support from sharply higher belly and cattle prices also underpinned today's rally. Talk of steady cash bids next week could support steady to higher prices on Monday however, trading volume will be very thin leaving the door open for volatile trading. Today's gap up may prove to be an upside breakaway gap. While a setback is possible on Monday, the stage is set for a test of November's high crossing at 55.35 later this winter. Momentum indicators are higher signaling that additional gains are possible into early-January.   February cattle closed sharply higher on Friday due to short covering ahead of this afternoon's cattle-on-feed report. The report was called bullish for the April and June contracts because of the less-than-expected placements. Today's new high close for the week following by a friendly cattle-on-feed report sets the stage for a possible test of November's high crossing at 71.35 later this winter. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  March coffee closed sharply lower on Friday as it posted a key reversal down ahead of the Christmas Holiday weekend. Locals and funds were late sellers as they took advantage of thin pre-holiday trading volume. Additional weakness next week is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. Closes below 44.75 would confirm a breakout into new contract lows thereby opening the door for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40-cents later this winter.   March cocoa posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close on Friday as it continues to consolidate below Wednesday's gap crossing at 1297. Momentum indicators have turned bearish with this week's setback thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top is in place. If the decline resumes next week, December's low crossing at 1212 is March's next target. Closes below 1212 would open the door for a larger-degree decline into January.   March sugar posted an inside day with a slightly higher on Friday as it extended Thursday's short covering bounce following this week's spike below the 50% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 698. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. I am looking for March to renew this week's decline next week with November's low crossing at 661 being a possible target later this winter.   March cotton closed higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead of the Christmas Holiday weekend. This week's setback has turned stochastics and the RSI bearish again signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of the year. Closes above 37.60 or below 34.91 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.   I want to wish each and every one of you a very Merry Christmas. Take time to find and remember why we are celebrating Christmas.

The NASDAQ closed higher on Friday as it continues to consolidate above the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 1905.53. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. The March S&P 500 index also closed higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead of Christmas. Bulls remain encouraged by this week's short covering rebound off the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 1120.66. However, closes above December's high crossing at 1176 are needed to renew this fall's rally. Until then, March may decide to correct more in time than price, which would be long-term bullish.  The Dow posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday due to light bargain hunting buying ahead of the Christmas holiday weekend. Gains were limited following a downward revision of the third quarter GDP to -1.3% from the previous estimate of -1.1%. Additional pressure came from weak consumer confidence data. Nevertheless, the Dow remains poised to test the 62% retracement level of the May/September decline crossing at 10,094.10 in the near future.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  March T-bonds closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead of the Christmas holiday. A downward revision in economic growth for the third quarter along with weak consumer spending also provided light pressure to the market. Nevertheless, March remained above this fall's downtrend line, which leaves the door open for sideways to higher prices possibly into early-January. Stochastics and the RSI remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term. Closes above last week's high crossing at 102-05 would confirm this week's trendline breakout while opening the door for a larger-degree rebound this winter.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index closed higher on Friday due to strength in livestock, precious metals, fiber, and energies. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible into the end of the year. Today's rally sets the stage for a possible test of this month's high crossing at 193.39. Closes above 193.39 are needed to renew the CRB's rally off October's low.   ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed mostly higher on Friday with the exception of heating oil. Trading volume was limited as many traders decided to kick off the Christmas holiday early. Trading next week is likely to be subdued ahead of next Friday's meeting among OPEC nations at which time they will decide whether or not to proceed with their announced cutback on crude oil production beginning January 1 in an attempt to stabilize sagging energy prices.   February crude oil posted an inside day with a higher close due to light short covering on Friday as it consolidated some of Thursday's losses. February has broken out above this fall's downtrend line leaving it in position to test the early-December high crossing at 21.05 later this winter. Trading is likely to remain subdued ahead of next week's OPEC meeting.   February heating oil closed slightly lower on Friday thereby confirming Thursday's key reversal down. I would not be surprised to see sideways trading extend into the end of the year as traders await OPEC's decision about production next Friday. Closes above this week's high would open the door for a larger-degree rebound into early-January with November's high crossing at 64.35 being a potential target later this winter.   February unleaded gas closed slightly higher due to light short covering on Friday. This week's failed attempt to breakout the early-December high of 57.62 has left a possible double top on the daily chart. Closes above this resistance level would open the door for a possible test of November's gap crossing at 59.80 later this winter. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year.  February Henry Hub natural gas closed sharply higher on Friday as extended weather forecasts are calling for the first major winter storm of the winter to hit portions of the upper Midwest and move eastward beginning this weekend. Today's high fell short of testing last week's high crossing at 2.94. Closes above this resistance level would confirm a breakout above this fall's downtrend line while opening the door for a larger-degree rebound into January.   CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The March Dollar closed sharply higher on Friday and posted a hew high close for December. Short covering ahead of the Christmas holiday triggered today's rally. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that additional gains are possible. While a round of profit taking is possible when trading resumes next week, the stage is set for additional gains into early-January. I am looking for the March Dollar to eventually try and test November's high crossing at 118.27 later this winter.   The March Swiss Franc closed sharply lower on Friday thereby turning short-term momentum indicators bearish signaling that a short-term top has been posted. The nearly flat correction off November's low was one of time instead of price and underscores the weak tone of the market. While a short covering bounce is possible when trading resumes next week, the stage is set for a possible test of this fall's lows by early-January.   The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Friday and tested the 62% retracement level of November's rally crossing at .6300. While a short covering bounce is possible when trading resumes next week, momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. If the decline continues, the 75% retracement level crossing at .6273 is March's next target.   The March Japanese Yen plunged to new contract lows on Friday as it fell to a new three-year low against the U.S. Dollar. The late-week acceleration in this fall's decline leaves the market poised to eventually test monthly fib support crossing at .7568 later this winter. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible. Closes above November?s downtrend line crossing near .7970 are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place.  PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  February gold closed higher on Friday due to short covering triggered by today's sharp rally in the U.S. Dollar. As long as February gold remains above minor trendline support crossing near 276.50 the door remains open for sideways to higher prices into early January with November's high crossing at 283.30 being a potential target. Stochastics and the RSI are holding onto their bullish positions signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early- January.   March silver closed sharply higher on Thursday due in large part year-end short covering. Nevertheless, today's rally led to a close above the 50% retracement level crossing at 4.423 thereby renewing its rally off November's low. While stochastics and the RSI are very overbought, trend-following indicators such as the ADX are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   March copper closed higher on Friday after testing the 50% retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50. March's inability to push below this support level triggered a short covering rally into the close. However, additional strength next week with closes above the reaction high crossing at 69.45 are needed to confirm a bottom has been posted. Short-term momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March corn closed lower on Friday falling just a 1/4-cent short of testing the contract low posted in November. Closes below the contract low at 2.10 1/4 would open the door for additional weakness and a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this winter. Uncertainty over sales policies in Argentina and China along with lagging U.S. export sales, which are running 11% behind last year's sluggish pace continue to pressure the market. Today's sharp rally in the U.S. Dollar along with an increase in cheaper feed-grade wheat also pressured the market. Short-term momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of December.   March wheat closed higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead of the Christmas holiday. Light support came from expectations that this week's huge U.S. wheat sale to China will be confirmed before the end of the year. At the same time gains were limited due to ideas that Argentina will soon devalue its currency and that wheat exports will pick up significantly once this devaluation occurs. Since wheat is on pace to meet USDA export sales, any further sales to China could be extremely supportive to wheat prices as ending stocks will be directly effected. It will take closes above the Nov./Dec. downtrend line crossing near 2.95 to temper the bearish outlook in the market. Until then look for choppy price action to continue.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  January soybeans closed steady on Friday in quiet pre- holiday type trading. I do not see any major pickup in trading volume when traders return from Christmas next week. While demand for U.S. beans remains strong, near ideal growing condition in South America have bears penciling in another record soybean crop. Uncertainty about Argentina's political situation is also limiting near-term gains as they are expected to devalue their currency in the near future. Once this is done, they will likely become aggressive marketers of new crop soybeans once they become available to the market. At the same time, momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral hinting that a short-term bottom might be in or is near. Closes above trendline resistance crossing near 4.41 are needed to confirm a bottom is in place.  January soybean meal closed lower on Friday. Early strength led to a spike above minor resistance crossing at 151.90. However, a lack of follow-through buying triggered a sell off ahead of the close. Nevertheless, short-term momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  February hogs gapped up and closed sharply higher following Thursday's friendly monthly cold storage report confirming Thursday's upside reversal. Spillover support from sharply higher belly and cattle prices also underpinned today's rally. Talk of steady cash bids next week could support steady to higher prices on Monday however, trading volume will be very thin leaving the door open for volatile trading. Today's gap up may prove to be an upside breakaway gap. While a setback is possible on Monday, the stage is set for a test of November's high crossing at 55.35 later this winter. Momentum indicators are higher signaling that additional gains are possible into early-January.   February cattle closed sharply higher on Friday due to short covering ahead of this afternoon's cattle-on-feed report. The report was called bullish for the April and June contracts because of the less-than-expected placements. Today's new high close for the week following by a friendly cattle-on-feed report sets the stage for a possible test of November's high crossing at 71.35 later this winter. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  March coffee closed sharply lower on Friday as it posted a key reversal down ahead of the Christmas Holiday weekend. Locals and funds were late sellers as they took advantage of thin pre-holiday trading volume. Additional weakness next week is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. Closes below 44.75 would confirm a breakout into new contract lows thereby opening the door for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40-cents later this winter.   March cocoa posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close on Friday as it continues to consolidate below Wednesday's gap crossing at 1297. Momentum indicators have turned bearish with this week's setback thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top is in place. If the decline resumes next week, December's low crossing at 1212 is March's next target. Closes below 1212 would open the door for a larger-degree decline into January.   March sugar posted an inside day with a slightly higher on Friday as it extended Thursday's short covering bounce following this week's spike below the 50% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 698. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. I am looking for March to renew this week's decline next week with November's low crossing at 661 being a possible target later this winter.   March cotton closed higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead of the Christmas Holiday weekend. This week's setback has turned stochastics and the RSI bearish again signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of the year. Closes above 37.60 or below 34.91 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.   I want to wish each and every one of you a very Merry Christmas. Take time to find and remember why we are celebrating Christmas.

However, light profit taking ahead of the close tempered some of today's gains leaving the door open for sideways trading on Thursday. The NASDAQ remains above the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 1905.53. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. The March S&P 500 index also closed higher on Wednesday but ended the day near mid-range, which leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday. March continues to rebound off the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 1120.66. However, closes above December's high crossing at 1176 are needed to renew this fall's rally. Until then, March may decide to correct more in time than price, which would be long-term bullish.  The Dow closed higher on Wednesday as better-than-expected holiday retail sales from Wal-Mart and Yahoo! Underpinned today's rally. Tech stocks found light support as investors bought on the hope that this sector and the economy would benefit from consumer's willingness to buy. Wal-Mart stock rose $1.11 per share to $58.24. Yahoo! Also rose by $1.13 to $17.80 after the online company reported holiday sales rose by 86% from the previous year. The Dow fell just short of testing its early December high of 10,169.40. Closes above this resistance level are needed to renew this fall's rally. The Dow closed just below the 62% retracement level of the May/September decline crossing at 10,094.10 at 10,088.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  March T-bonds closed lower on Wednesday due to strength in the equity markets. March opened lower and extended losses throughout the session as it extended its setback off last week's high, which spiked above this fall's downtrend line. Until March bonds close above December's reaction high crossing at 102-05, the near-term trend will remain sideways possibly into early-January. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index closed sharply higher on Wednesday due to strength in cattle, precious metals, fiber, and energies. Today's new high close for December has set the stage for a possible test of the 25% retracement level of this year's decline crossing at 194.76. Closes above this resistance level and this year's downtrend line crossing near 195.35 are needed to confirm that a major bottom and trend change has taken place. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the early-January.   ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed sharply higher on Wednesday, as OPEC appears more certain of announcing on Friday an output cut of 2 million barrels of crude oil per day beginning January 1.  February crude oil closed sharply higher on Wednesday and above the previous reaction high crossing at 21.05 thereby opening the door for a larger-degree rebound into January. Session highs fell short of testing the 38% retracement level of this fall's decline crossing at 21.77. If this resistance level is cleared, November's high crossing at 22.83 is a possible target in early-January. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term.   February heating oil closed into new highs for December on Wednesday thereby negating the possibility that last week's high marked a double top. Wednesday's high-range close opens the door for additional gains into early-January with November's reaction high crossing at 64.35 being the next likely upside target. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near- term.   February unleaded gas soared to new highs for December as they exceeded minor resistance crossing at 57.90 and filled November's gap at 59.80. Today's high-range close sets the stage for follow-through buying on Thursday. If the rally continues, November's high crossing at 62.31 is February's next target. Momentum indicators are becoming overbought but remain bullish signaling that additional gains are possible into early-January.  February Henry Hub natural gas closed slightly higher on Wednesday thereby confirming last Friday's breakout above this fall's downtrend line. Extended weather forecasts are calling for below normal temps to persist across the Midwest and eastward through the weekend before a small warm up is possible. Unless there is an extended period of time of below normal temps across high demand regions of the country, upside potential remains limited due to the abundant supplies of natural gas in storage. Short-term momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January. If the rebound continues, November's reaction high crossing at 3.165 is February's next target.   CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The March Dollar closed slightly lower on Wednesday due to light profit taking as it consolidated some of Monday's gains. Nevertheless, March remained above broken resistance marked by November's high, which crosses at 118.27. If the rally continues, the 75% retracement level of this summer's decline crossing at 119.57 is March's next upside target. Trend-following indicators such as the ADX are entering bullish trend modes signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   The March Swiss Franc closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to light short covering after spiking below September's low crossing at .5860 in early trading. Today's high-range close leaves the door open for additional short covering on Thursday. However, the recent breakout below this fall's trading range has opened the door for sideways to lower prices into early-January. If the decline continues, fib support crossing at .5722 is March's next target.   The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Wednesday and below the 75% retracement level of November's rally crossing at .6273. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. If the decline continues, November's low crossing at .6230 is March's next target.   The March Japanese Yen plunged to new contract lows on Wednesday as it continues to accelerate towards monthly fib support crossing at .7568. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into early- January.  PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  February gold closed higher on Wednesday as it extended its rebound off last week's low. Closes above last week's high crossing at 281.40 are needed to renew February's rebound off December's low. Closes above November's high crossing at 283.30 would open the door for a larger-degree rebound as the new year begins. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   March silver closed slightly lower on Wednesday due light profit taking as it consolidated some of its recent gains. If the rally continues, the 62% retracement level of this fall's decline crossing at 4.51 is March's next target. Stochastics and the RSI are very overbought however, the ADX is bullish signaling that additional gains are possible into early-January.   March copper closed higher on Wednesday as it extended last Friday's rebound off the 50% retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50. Closes above the reaction high crossing at 69.45 are needed to confirm a bottom has been posted. Short-term momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March corn closed lower on Wednesday as they broke out below November's low at 2.10 1/4 to post a new contract low. While a short covering bounce is possible on Thursday, the door has been opened for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this winter. Short-term momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. Today's sell off was triggered from increased fears that Argentina will be an aggressive seller of wheat and corn early next year due to their precarious economic and political situation. Additional pressure came from uncertainty over China's corn supply situation, which paints a bearish picture for U.S. corn exports.  March wheat closed lower on Wednesday due to fund selling. Spillover weakness from corn and soybeans along with lackluster wheat export shipments weighed on prices throughout the day. March wheat is challenging minor trendline support drawn across this month's lows, which crosses near 2.83. Closes below this support level would open the door for a test of December's low crossing at 2.77 and then this fall's low at 2.73 later this winter. While there was some talk about a lack of snow cover across the Plains, which could lead to possible winter kill, temps would have to remain below normal for a few weeks before these concerns are taken seriously by the market. Today's decline turned stochastics and the RSI bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are likely into early-January.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  January soybeans closed sharply lower on Wednesday, as South American weather is not considered a major threat to big crops at this point in time. Additional pressure came from political and economic uncertainty in Argentina. Trading volume was light today as it did not take much selling to push the market sharply lower on the day. The low-range close leaves the door open for additional selling on Thursday. Closes below this fall's low crossing at 4.26 1/4 would renew the larger-degree downtrend while opening the door for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 4.17 1/2 later this winter.   January soybean meal closed lower on Wednesday thereby confirming last Friday's downside reversal. Today's sell off was somewhat of a surprise to the market given the below normal temps, which have moved across the Midwest since the weekend. Extended weather forecasts are calling for below- normal temps to continue for the next 10-days. Despite this bullish weather forecast, Wednesday's low-range close sets the stage for follow-through weakness on Thursday. Closes below December's low crossing at 147.60 would renew this fall's decline while opening the door for a possible test of May's low crossing at 146.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  February hogs closed lower on Wednesday due to light profit taking as it consolidated some of its recent gains. Today's round of profit taking may continue into Friday's quarterly hogs and pigs report due out Friday after the close. Pre- report estimates are as follows.   All hogs and pigs 99.9% (range 98.9-101%)  Kept for breading 99.3% (range 98.5-101.5%)  Kept for marketing 100.1% (range 99-101%)  Trading is likely to remain subdued on Thursday with cash bids called steady to firmer. Multiple closes above this summer's downtrend line crossing near 56.40 are needed to keep February's rally off December's low alive. Stochastics remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   February cattle closed modestly higher on Wednesday due to a late-session rally triggered by hopes for higher cash bids later this week. Additional support came from expectations that this week's Showlists would be lighter than last week. Gains were limited due to futures premium to the cash market. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January. If the rally off December's low continues, this fall's high crossing at 73.50 is a potential target later this winter.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  The coffee market was closed today. Here is a recap of last Friday's trade. March coffee closed sharply lower on Friday as it posted a key reversal down ahead of the Christmas Holiday weekend. Locals and funds were late sellers as they took advantage of thin pre-holiday trading volume. Additional weakness next week is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. Closes below 44.75 would confirm a breakout into new contract lows thereby opening the door for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40- cents later this winter.   The cocoa market was closed today. Here is a recap of last Friday's trade. March cocoa posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close on Friday as it continues to consolidate below Wednesday's gap crossing at 1297. Momentum indicators have turned bearish with this week's setback thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top is in place. If the decline resumes next week, December's low crossing at 1212 is March's next target. Closes below 1212 would open the door for a larger-degree decline into January.   The sugar market was closed today. Here is a recap of last Friday's trade. March sugar posted an inside day with a slightly higher on Friday as it extended Thursday's short covering bounce following this week's spike below the 50% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 698. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. I am looking for March to renew this week's decline next week with November's low crossing at 661 being a possible target later this winter.   March cotton closed modestly higher on Wednesday due to light speculator buying however, trading volume was thin and is expected to be that weigh for the balance of the week. Stochastics and the RSI are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early January. Closes above 37.60 or below 34.91 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.

The NASDAQ continues to consolidate above key fib support crossing at 1905.53. Closes above last week's high at 2010.91 are needed to temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. The March S&P 500 index posted its highest close in nearly two and a half weeks on Thursday. The persistent rebound off the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 1120.66 has set the stage for a possible test of December's high crossing at 1176 by early-January.   The Dow posted a quiet inside day with a modestly higher close on Thursday as it consolidated above the 62% retracement level of the May/September decline crossing at 10,094.10 at 10,088. Technology stocks supported today's rally however, trading volume was light due to the holidays.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  March T-bonds closed higher on Thursday and in the process posted a key reversal up. Additional strength will be needed on Thursday to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern. However, closes above December's reaction high crossing at 102-05 will be need to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place. Until then look for sideways trading to continue into early-January. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index posted a key reversal down on Thursday due to weakness in cattle, precious metals, fiber, and energies. Today's high fell short of testing of the 25% retracement level of this year's decline crossing at 194.76. The CRB index is at a crossroads as it consolidates below the 25% retracement level and this year's downtrend line crossing near 195.35. Unless these resistance levels are cleared, it would appear as though a double top might be forming with today's bearish reversal pattern.   ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed lower on Thursday due to profit taking as the market position itself ahead of this week's API inventory report and Friday's OPEC meeting. The market is expecting this week's API inventory report to be bullish, which has helped temper some of today's losses. Light pressure also came from today's bearish AGA inventor report for natural gas, which was the second-smallest draw on inventories for the corresponding week in December since the AGA started its weekly report in 1994.   February crude oil closed modestly lower on Thursday and settled below the previous reaction high crossing at 21.05. A late day rally tempered some of today's losses as February closed mid-range thereby leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday. A bullish API inventory report on Friday could provide the catalyst needed to extend this month's rally. The 38% retracement level of this fall's decline crossing at 21.77, then November's high at 22.83 are potential targets later this winter. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term.   February heating oil closed lower on Thursday but remained above broken resistance crossing at 57.80 thereby keeping the door open for a possible test of November's reaction high crossing at 64.35 later this winter. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   February unleaded gas posted an inside day with a lower close on Thursday as it consolidated some of Wednesday's gains, which appear to have been overdone. However, today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that additional gains are possible into early-January. If this week's rally continues, November's high crossing at 62.31 is February's next target.   February Henry Hub natural gas closed sharply lower on Thursday following today's bearish AGA inventory report. The report showed a draw of 81 bcf on U.S. inventories, which was slightly above industry expectations however, there were too many people caught in January and were forced to liquidate, which pulled the rest of the contracts lower on the day. Several long-term weather forecasts are calling for a bitter cold snap towards mid-January, which might help limit, any short-term losses. However, traders are cautious about cold-weather predictions after two months of above normal temps this fall. Closes below 2.58 would renew this fall's decline as we begin the new year.  CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The March Dollar closed lower on Thursday as it continues to consolidate some of Monday's gains. A rebound ahead of the close tempered some of today's loss leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday. March's failure to close above November's high crossing at 118.27 on Thursday raises the possibility that this week's high might have marked a double top. If the rally continues, the 75% retracement level of this summer's decline crossing at 119.57 is March's next upside target.   The March Swiss Franc closed higher on Thursday due to short covering. Session highs spiked above broken support crossing at .5973 however, March remained below this fall's trading range. I would not be surprised to see March consolidate below broken trading range support for the balance of the year. If the decline resumes, fib support crossing at .5722 is March's next target.   The March Canadian Dollar posted a potential key reversal up on Thursday after testing November's low at .6230 earlier in the day. March's inability to push through this support level triggered a short covering rally however, gains were tempered due to a late-day sell off before the close. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday.   The March Japanese Yen extended its decline off September's high on Thursday and is poised to test monthly fib support crossing at .7568 in the near future. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into early-January.  PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  February gold closed lower on Thursday and is breakout out below December's uptrend line crossing near 277.80. Multiple closes below this support level are needed to confirm today's trendline breakout, which would then open the door for sideways to lower prices into early-January. Today's decline turned stochastics and the RSI neutral to bearish hinting that a short-term top is in or near.   March silver closed lower on Thursday and below the 62% retracement level of this fall's decline crossing at 4.51 thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top is in place or near. Stochastics and the RSI are very overbought and turning bearish with this week's setback warning bullish traders to use caution. A downturn by the ADX is needed to confirm that the rebound off November's high has come to an end.   March copper closed lower on Thursday as it consolidated some of Wednesday's gain. March has become range bound between the 50% retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50 and below the reaction high crossing at 69.45. A breakout in either direction of this trading range is needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Short-term momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early- January.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March corn closed higher on Thursday due to light short covering ahead of this week's export sales report due out Friday morning. Today's rebound fell short of testing broken support crossing at 2.10 1/4 thereby leaving the door open for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this winter. Stochastics and the RSI remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. Producer selling is almost non-existent and is likely to remain that way until mid-January when cash merchandisers expect producers to resume cash sales.   March wheat closed higher on Thursday following today's announcement that Egypt purchased up to 120,000 metric tonnes of U.S. soft red winter wheat along with 180,000 metric tonnes of Australian standard white wheat. This news triggered a short covering rally that erased all of Wednesday's losses. Today's high-range close leaves the door open for sideways to higher trading on Friday if tomorrow's export sales report comes in neutral to friendly. From a broader perspective, March wheat needs to close above trendline resistance crossing near 2.94 or below trendline support crossing near 2.83 to clear up near-term direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI returned to bullish modes with today's rally signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible near-term.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March soybeans closed steady on Thursday as positioning ahead of January deliveries and year-end position squaring dominated today's trading. Strong U.S. exports and domestic demand are being offset by rising South American crop prospects and forecasts calling for record global ending stocks. This week's breakout below trading range support crossing at 4.32 1/2 has opened the door for a possible test of weekly support crossing at 4.23 1/2 in the near future.   March soybean meal closed slightly higher on Thursday due to light short covering amidst strong domestic demand. However, this week's move to new lows for December has opened the door for a likely test of April's low crossing at 142 later this winter. This week's export sales report is not expected to hold any surprises for the market, which will leave meal looking towards soybeans for near-term direction. It will take closes above this summer's downtrend line crossing near 151.90 to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  February hogs posted an inside day with a higher close due to spillover support from sharply higher belly prices. Short covering ahead of Friday's quarterly hogs and pigs report also provided light support to the market. The trade is expecting tomorrow's report to be neutral to bullish. However, this month's run up in prices appears to have already factored in a modest amount of bullish news in the upcoming report. February hogs are poised to test this summer's downtrend line crossing near 56.40. Closes above this resistance level would open the door for a larger- degree rebound into early-January.   February cattle posted a downside reversal on Thursday, as traders were disappointed over the lack of an established cash price. While temps are running below normal across cattle feeding country, there are no storms to disrupt movement, which is short-term bearish. Technically, the door remains open for February cattle to try and test November's high crossing at 71.35. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their respective overbought zones hinting that February cattle may struggle to overcome this resistance level.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  March coffee posted an inside day with a lower close on Thursday as it consolidated some of last Friday's loss. Closes below 46.00 are needed to confirm last Friday's key reversal down, which would then set the stage for a likely test of this month's low crossing at 44.75. Closes below 44.75 would confirm a breakout into new contract lows thereby opening the door for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40-cents later this winter. Expectations for a bumper Brazilian crop this spring along with expectations that Vietnam might be an aggressive seller of their crop after the first of the year will likely keep pressure on the market into January.   March cocoa posted a key reversal on Thursday filling last week's gap at 1297. Thin holiday trading allowed local traders to run buy stops, which exaggerated today's rally. Meanwhile purchases at Ivory Coast ports are running well ahead of last year's pace during the height of the shipping season. March will need to close above 1365 or below 1212 to clear up near-term direction in the market.   March sugar gapped above December's downtrend line on Thursday thereby confirming that last week's spike below the 50% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 698 marked a short-term bottom. However, the mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Today's rally turned stochastics and the RSI bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   March cotton posted an inside day with a lower close on Thursday as it consolidates above the Nov./Dec. downtrend line. Trading was subdued ahead of tomorrow's weekly export sales report. Export demand needs to remain strong in order to sustain this week's anemic trendline breakout. News that China may see a significant cutback in cotton acreage this coming year also provided light support to the market.

Tech stocks remain strong lead by gains in Yahoo, which rose 75-cents to $18.52 on a fourth-quarter revenue update by Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget. Today's rise on the consumer confidence index also supported today's rallies in the stock indexes. The NASDAQ closed higher on Friday but near session lows due to a sell off ahead of the close. Closes above the reaction high crossing at 2010.91 would open the door for a possible test of December's high early next year. The March S&P 500 index closed slightly lower on Friday due to a late-session sell off triggered by year-end tax selling.   The Dow closed slightly higher on Friday as today's positive economic news was off set by year-end selling by investors for tax purposes. The marked jump in the consumer confidence index, which came in at 93.7 versus expectations of 83 and above November's 84.9 raised hopes that a recovery in business may be possible beginning in the first quarter of 2002. The Dow continues to consolidate above the 62% retracement level of the May/September decline crossing at 10,094.10. At the same time, a number of short-term momentum indicators are becoming overbought hinting that we could see a brief setback to start the new year.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  March T-bonds closed lower on Friday as the latest economic data shows a rise in home sales along with increased orders for many big-ticket items. Additional support came from a rebound in consumer confidence raising hopes that better days may be ahead for the ailing economy as we move into 2002. The latest consumer confidence index rose to 93.7 up from a revised 84.9 in November. Analysts were expecting a figure close to 83. Technically, March bonds appear to be forming an inverted head and shoulder's bottom. Closes above 102-05 are needed before this bottom formation can be confirmed. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early- January.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday. Thursday's key reversal down remains unconfirmed, as the CRB did not take out yesterday's low. However, momentum indicators are diverging warning that a double top might have been posted with yesterday's high. The CRB index will need to close above this year's downtrend line crossing near 195.35 to confirm a major trend change is taking place.   ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed lower on Friday with the exception of natural gas. Early strength was due to OPEC's announced product cuts for January 1, 2002. However, profit taking by mid-session in a ""buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact"" move on the part of traders led to a sell off into the close. OPEC confirmed that it will cut production by 1.5 million barrels per day beginning January 1 and those cuts will remain in place for 6-months. Crude oil prices have already risen $3.11 from their November lows as the markets have already priced in some of today's bullish news.   February crude oil closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking before the end of the year. Today's low-range close leaves the door open for follow-through selling when trading resumes next week. If traders return from the holidays in a buying mood, February crude oil may try and test November's high at 22.83 in early-January. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term.   February heating oil closed lower on Friday and below broken resistance crossing at 57.80. February's inability to rally on confirmation of bullish news strongly suggests that most of if not all of today's bullish news has already been factored into prices. If February extends this month's rally next week, November's reaction high crossing at 64.35 is a possible target later this winter.   February unleaded gas posted key reversal down on Friday as early strength fell short of testing November's high at 62.31. Year-end profit taking ahead of the close pulled February into negative territory. Additional weakness next week is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top might have been posted.  February Henry Hub natural gas posted an inside day with a higher close due to light short covering as it consolidated some of Thursday's losses. Today's rebound was triggered by extended forecast, which are calling for below-normal temps to spread across the upper part of the U.S. during the first week of January. Closes above 3.034 or below 2.555 are needed to confirm a breakout of December's trading range.  CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The March Dollar posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday as it continues to consolidate some of Monday's gains. Today's close below November's high at 118.27 and the 62% retracement level of this summer's decline crossing at 118.23 should be noted by bullish traders. Multiple closes below these broken resistance levels would temper the near- term bullish outlook in the Dollar. If the rally resumes, the 75% retracement level of this summer's decline crossing at 119.57 is March's next upside target.   The March Swiss Franc closed slightly higher on Friday as it consolidates below broken support crossing at .5973. Closes above this broken support level would temper the near-term bearish outlook in the Franc. Closes below this week's low at .5797 would renew December's decline and could lead to a test of fib support crossing at .5722 later this winter.   The March Canadian Dollar closed higher on Friday due to year-end short covering following this week's test of November's low at .6230. Today's rally also confirmed Thursday's key reversal up thereby increasing the odds that additional short covering is possible into early-January. Additional strength will be needed before momentum indicators turn bullish.   The March Japanese Yen closed higher on Friday due to year- end short covering. However, the mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways to lower trading when the yen reopens next week. I am still looking for March to test monthly fib support crossing at .7568 in the near future. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into early-January.  PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  February gold closed lower on Friday confirming Thursday's breakout out below December's uptrend line. Today's close below December's uptrend line opens the door for sideways to lower prices into early-January. Stochastics and the RSI are turning bearish signaling that additional weakness into the first half of January is possible. I would not be surprised to see a trading range develop after the first of the year, which could last well into February.   March silver posted an upside reversal on Friday but remained below the 62% retracement level of this fall's decline crossing at 4.51. Stochastics and the RSI are very overbought and turning bearish warning traders to use caution as a top might be in or near. Closes below December's uptrend line crossing near 4.39 are needed before this is confirmed. The daily ADX turned down with Thursday's decline hinting that the rally off November's low is in trouble.   March copper closed lower on Friday and is poised to test the 50% retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50. Closes below this support level or above the reaction high crossing at 69.45 are needed to confirm a breakout of December's trading range and clear up near-term direction in the market.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March corn closed fractionally higher on Friday following this morning's weekly export sales report, which came in better than expected at 35.82 million bushels. However, weakness in the soybean complex and wheat tempered today's gains in March corn. This week's breakout below key support crossing at 2.10 1/4 has set the stage for a test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this winter. Stochastics and the RSI are oversold but bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. The grain markets will be closed on Monday, the last day of this year.   March wheat closed fractionally lower on Friday despite today's announcement that Spain purchased 100,000 metric tonnes of U.S. soft red winter wheat for delivery in the 2001/02 marketing year. Profit taking ahead of the close along with spillover weakness from soybeans pulled March wheat lower on the day. Closes above trendline resistance crossing near 2.94 or below trendline support crossing near 2.83 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March soybeans closed lower on Friday following today's disappointing export sales report, which showed net sales of 21.27 million bushels. The market ignored the monthly crush report for November, which came in at 149.1 million bushels as traders chose to focus on South American's growing crop potential. March beans closed out the week near session lows as it is poised to test weekly support crossing at 4.23 1/2 in the near future.   March soybean meal posted a key reversal down on Friday and closed below minor support crossing at 144.90 despite today's bullish crush report. Multiple closes below this support level would open the door for a test of April's low crossing at 142 later this winter. This week's export sales report was very impressive with net sales of 238,600 metric tonnes. However, thin holiday trading along with a lack of willing buyers allowed locals to push prices lower into the close. Closes above this summer's downtrend line crossing near 151.90 are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  February hogs closed higher on Friday due to higher cash bids. However, today's rally was capped by this summer's downtrend line crossing near 56.40. Closes above this resistance level would open the door for a larger-degree rebound into January. Traders went into this afternoon's report looking for a bullish number. Early calls by traders indicated that the report was bullish for the nearby futures but bearish for the deferred contracts.   Hog inventory as of Dec. 1 was 99%, average estimates came in at 99.9%.  Hogs kept for breeding came in at 99%, average estimates came in at 99.3%.  Hogs kept for marketing came in at 99%, average estimates came in at 100.1%.  The marketing and breeding numbers are bullish as the report showed that there has been no expansion despite low feed cost, low interest rates and profits throughout the year. I am looking for higher prices on Monday and possible into next Wednesday now that the report is out of the way. However, this month's rally has already factored in a sizeable portion of today's bullish report into prices already.   February cattle posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday as stronger cash bids underpinned today's rally. Feedlots and packers battled all week before they finally agreed at a $64 minimum bid. Cash sources indicated that there were a few bids at $65 in some areas. Today's higher cash bid came on the heels of lower boxed beef prices this afternoon. Today's high-range close leaves the door open for a possible test of November's high crossing at 71.35 on Monday. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that this target is within reach of the market.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  March coffee posted another key reversal down on Friday as the outlook for a bumper Brazilian coffee crop this spring continues to weigh on prices. Trading was light ahead of the upcoming 4-day holiday weekend as traders completed end of the year position squaring. Closes below 44.75 would confirm a breakout into new contract lows thereby opening the door for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40- cents later this winter.   March cocoa closed slightly higher on Friday thereby confirming yesterday's key reversal up. Early strength tied to spillover short covering from Thursday's rally ran out of gas by mid-session. March will need to close above 1365 or below 1212 to clear up near-term direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   March sugar extended Thursday's short covering rebound on Friday due to light fund buying triggered by Syria's tender for 13,000 tonnes of raws and news that Egypt is shopping for 26,000 tonnes of raws and whites for Jan./Feb. shipment. Stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   March cotton closed lower on Friday as the market ignored today's strong export sales report, which showed net sales of 228,800 bales and focused on the weak U.S. consumption data. The consumption report showed that the annualized adjusted rate for U.S. consumption came in at 7.32 million bales, which was some 100,000 bales below pre-report estimates and is down 19% from year ago levels. Today's close below broken trendline resistance opens the door for a possible test of this month's low crossing at 34.91 in early January.

Natural Gas, boosted by winter chills, was the only energy market to close on the upside.  Sentiment in Grains and Oilseeds was influenced by a decline in Soybeans, affected by South American weather patterns, the Argentina crisis and the Pakistan-India tensions.  A bumper Brazilian crop kept the lid on Coffee, a late surge in Cocoa ran out of steam, Cotton ended lower on weak US consumption data, while Sugar rebounded on short-covering.  A drop in lease rates took Silver down, Gold went nowhere, while Copper took a late hit.  Cattle was firm and Bellies pumped up. Equities got a boost from improving consumer sentiment, while in Foreign Exchange the Yen staged a rally.   - Alex McCallum, Editorial Director & Forum Moderator  _____________________________________________________________________  <2>     Trader, HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO EARN A DAY? _____________________________________________________________________  Free 18-Page Online Brochure - Wealth Building Lessons Inside http://store.ino.com/private/1E78A/TWTMM-MoneyMiracle   Dear Trader:  Everybody always told me that I would have to work very  hard to make a lot of money.

Tech stocks remain strong lead by gains in Yahoo, which rose 75-cents to $18.52 on a fourth-quarter revenue update by Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget. Today's rise on the consumer confidence index also supported today's rallies in the stock indexes. The NASDAQ closed higher on Friday but near session lows due to a sell off ahead of the close. Closes above the reaction high crossing at 2010.91 would open the door for a possible test of December's high early next year. The March S&P 500 index closed slightly lower on Friday due to a late-session sell off triggered by year-end tax selling.   The Dow closed slightly higher on Friday as today's positive economic news was off set by year-end selling by investors for tax purposes. The marked jump in the consumer confidence index, which came in at 93.7 versus expectations of 83 and above November's 84.9 raised hopes that a recovery in business may be possible beginning in the first quarter of 2002. The Dow continues to consolidate above the 62% retracement level of the May/September decline crossing at 10,094.10. At the same time, a number of short-term momentum indicators are becoming overbought hinting that we could see a brief setback to start the new year.   INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest  March T-bonds closed lower on Friday as the latest economic data shows a rise in home sales along with increased orders for many big-ticket items. Additional support came from a rebound in consumer confidence raising hopes that better days may be ahead for the ailing economy as we move into 2002. The latest consumer confidence index rose to 93.7 up from a revised 84.9 in November. Analysts were expecting a figure close to 83. Technically, March bonds appear to be forming an inverted head and shoulder's bottom. Closes above 102-05 are needed before this bottom formation can be confirmed. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early- January.   The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes  The CRB index posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday. Thursday's key reversal down remains unconfirmed, as the CRB did not take out yesterday's low. However, momentum indicators are diverging warning that a double top might have been posted with yesterday's high. The CRB index will need to close above this year's downtrend line crossing near 195.35 to confirm a major trend change is taking place.   ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy  The energy markets closed lower on Friday with the exception of natural gas. Early strength was due to OPEC's announced product cuts for January 1, 2002. However, profit taking by mid-session in a ""buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact"" move on the part of traders led to a sell off into the close. OPEC confirmed that it will cut production by 1.5 million barrels per day beginning January 1 and those cuts will remain in place for 6-months. Crude oil prices have already risen $3.11 from their November lows as the markets have already priced in some of today's bullish news.   February crude oil closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking before the end of the year. Today's low-range close leaves the door open for follow-through selling when trading resumes next week. If traders return from the holidays in a buying mood, February crude oil may try and test November's high at 22.83 in early-January. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term.   February heating oil closed lower on Friday and below broken resistance crossing at 57.80. February's inability to rally on confirmation of bullish news strongly suggests that most of if not all of today's bullish news has already been factored into prices. If February extends this month's rally next week, November's reaction high crossing at 64.35 is a possible target later this winter.   February unleaded gas posted key reversal down on Friday as early strength fell short of testing November's high at 62.31. Year-end profit taking ahead of the close pulled February into negative territory. Additional weakness next week is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top might have been posted.  February Henry Hub natural gas posted an inside day with a higher close due to light short covering as it consolidated some of Thursday's losses. Today's rebound was triggered by extended forecast, which are calling for below-normal temps to spread across the upper part of the U.S. during the first week of January. Closes above 3.034 or below 2.555 are needed to confirm a breakout of December's trading range.  CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies  The March Dollar posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday as it continues to consolidate some of Monday's gains. Today's close below November's high at 118.27 and the 62% retracement level of this summer's decline crossing at 118.23 should be noted by bullish traders. Multiple closes below these broken resistance levels would temper the near- term bullish outlook in the Dollar. If the rally resumes, the 75% retracement level of this summer's decline crossing at 119.57 is March's next upside target.   The March Swiss Franc closed slightly higher on Friday as it consolidates below broken support crossing at .5973. Closes above this broken support level would temper the near-term bearish outlook in the Franc. Closes below this week's low at .5797 would renew December's decline and could lead to a test of fib support crossing at .5722 later this winter.   The March Canadian Dollar closed higher on Friday due to year-end short covering following this week's test of November's low at .6230. Today's rally also confirmed Thursday's key reversal up thereby increasing the odds that additional short covering is possible into early-January. Additional strength will be needed before momentum indicators turn bullish.   The March Japanese Yen closed higher on Friday due to year- end short covering. However, the mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways to lower trading when the yen reopens next week. I am still looking for March to test monthly fib support crossing at .7568 in the near future. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into early-January.  PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals  February gold closed lower on Friday confirming Thursday's breakout out below December's uptrend line. Today's close below December's uptrend line opens the door for sideways to lower prices into early-January. Stochastics and the RSI are turning bearish signaling that additional weakness into the first half of January is possible. I would not be surprised to see a trading range develop after the first of the year, which could last well into February.   March silver posted an upside reversal on Friday but remained below the 62% retracement level of this fall's decline crossing at 4.51. Stochastics and the RSI are very overbought and turning bearish warning traders to use caution as a top might be in or near. Closes below December's uptrend line crossing near 4.39 are needed before this is confirmed. The daily ADX turned down with Thursday's decline hinting that the rally off November's low is in trouble.   March copper closed lower on Friday and is poised to test the 50% retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50. Closes below this support level or above the reaction high crossing at 69.45 are needed to confirm a breakout of December's trading range and clear up near-term direction in the market.   GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March corn closed fractionally higher on Friday following this morning's weekly export sales report, which came in better than expected at 35.82 million bushels. However, weakness in the soybean complex and wheat tempered today's gains in March corn. This week's breakout below key support crossing at 2.10 1/4 has set the stage for a test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this winter. Stochastics and the RSI are oversold but bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. The grain markets will be closed on Monday, the last day of this year.   March wheat closed fractionally lower on Friday despite today's announcement that Spain purchased 100,000 metric tonnes of U.S. soft red winter wheat for delivery in the 2001/02 marketing year. Profit taking ahead of the close along with spillover weakness from soybeans pulled March wheat lower on the day. Closes above trendline resistance crossing near 2.94 or below trendline support crossing near 2.83 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains  March soybeans closed lower on Friday following today's disappointing export sales report, which showed net sales of 21.27 million bushels. The market ignored the monthly crush report for November, which came in at 149.1 million bushels as traders chose to focus on South American's growing crop potential. March beans closed out the week near session lows as it is poised to test weekly support crossing at 4.23 1/2 in the near future.   March soybean meal posted a key reversal down on Friday and closed below minor support crossing at 144.90 despite today's bullish crush report. Multiple closes below this support level would open the door for a test of April's low crossing at 142 later this winter. This week's export sales report was very impressive with net sales of 238,600 metric tonnes. However, thin holiday trading along with a lack of willing buyers allowed locals to push prices lower into the close. Closes above this summer's downtrend line crossing near 151.90 are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change.   LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock  February hogs closed higher on Friday due to higher cash bids. However, today's rally was capped by this summer's downtrend line crossing near 56.40. Closes above this resistance level would open the door for a larger-degree rebound into January. Traders went into this afternoon's report looking for a bullish number. Early calls by traders indicated that the report was bullish for the nearby futures but bearish for the deferred contracts.   Hog inventory as of Dec. 1 was 99%, average estimates came in at 99.9%.  Hogs kept for breeding came in at 99%, average estimates came in at 99.3%.  Hogs kept for marketing came in at 99%, average estimates came in at 100.1%.  The marketing and breeding numbers are bullish as the report showed that there has been no expansion despite low feed cost, low interest rates and profits throughout the year. I am looking for higher prices on Monday and possible into next Wednesday now that the report is out of the way. However, this month's rally has already factored in a sizeable portion of today's bullish report into prices already.   February cattle posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday as stronger cash bids underpinned today's rally. Feedlots and packers battled all week before they finally agreed at a $64 minimum bid. Cash sources indicated that there were a few bids at $65 in some areas. Today's higher cash bid came on the heels of lower boxed beef prices this afternoon. Today's high-range close leaves the door open for a possible test of November's high crossing at 71.35 on Monday. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that this target is within reach of the market.   FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food  March coffee posted another key reversal down on Friday as the outlook for a bumper Brazilian coffee crop this spring continues to weigh on prices. Trading was light ahead of the upcoming 4-day holiday weekend as traders completed end of the year position squaring. Closes below 44.75 would confirm a breakout into new contract lows thereby opening the door for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40- cents later this winter.   March cocoa closed slightly higher on Friday thereby confirming yesterday's key reversal up. Early strength tied to spillover short covering from Thursday's rally ran out of gas by mid-session. March will need to close above 1365 or below 1212 to clear up near-term direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   March sugar extended Thursday's short covering rebound on Friday due to light fund buying triggered by Syria's tender for 13,000 tonnes of raws and news that Egypt is shopping for 26,000 tonnes of raws and whites for Jan./Feb. shipment. Stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January.   March cotton closed lower on Friday as the market ignored today's strong export sales report, which showed net sales of 228,800 bales and focused on the weak U.S. consumption data. The consumption report showed that the annualized adjusted rate for U.S. consumption came in at 7.32 million bales, which was some 100,000 bales below pre-report estimates and is down 19% from year ago levels. Today's close below broken trendline resistance opens the door for a possible test of this month's low crossing at 34.91 in early January.

Cc: Lavorato, John Subject: Re-start/Integration Planning  We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-  + Infrastructure  Jenny Rub + Development  Jay Webb + EnronOnline  Webb / Forster + HR   David Oxley + Cash Management Tom Myers + Credit   Debbie Brackett  The rest will be completed shortly.  We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.  Customer Side  + Customers  Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)     Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)     Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) + Action Plan  Phase  1 Customers     Phase  2 Customers     Phase  3 Customers + Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) + Customer visit schedule  Product Side + List of Products Phase 1 - First Week     Phase 2 - First Month     Phase 3 - First Quarter  Target Number of Transactions + Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3  IT transfer   Louise",louise.kitchen@enron.com,mike.grigsby@enron.com,RE: Re-start/Integration Planning,2002-01-02 10:56:13-08:00,sent

Cc: Lavorato, John Subject: Re-start/Integration Planning  We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-  + Infrastructure  Jenny Rub + Development  Jay Webb + EnronOnline  Webb / Forster + HR   David Oxley + Cash Management Tom Myers + Credit   Debbie Brackett  The rest will be completed shortly.  We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.  Customer Side  + Customers  Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)     Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)     Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) + Action Plan  Phase  1 Customers     Phase  2 Customers     Phase  3 Customers + Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) + Customer visit schedule  Product Side + List of Products Phase 1 - First Week     Phase 2 - First Month     Phase 3 - First Quarter  Target Number of Transactions + Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3  IT transfer   Louise",mike.grigsby@enron.com,louise.kitchen@enron.com,RE: Re-start/Integration Planning,2002-01-02 11:03:22-08:00,received

"Tom and Phillip,   Let me know what your thoughts are on the arrangement of the Southwest.  Lavo informed Scott last night that the ERCOT desk would not be located next to Gas.     Scott and Hunter,   What are your thoughts on switching areas with each other.  It might be nice to have central next to Frankie Ermis and the rockies boys.  East would then be that much closer to Nymex.   Just a sketch.  Let me know what you think.

"Mikey all our fundies stuff is still locked down ...  try these web-sites:  Powerlytix.com and Friedwired.com (pw: enron, enron).  Next week we'll open the stuff back up ...
