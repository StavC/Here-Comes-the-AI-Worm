When you have had one of those ""Take This Job and Shove It"" days, try this:  On your way home after work, stop at your pharmacy and go to the section where they have thermometers. You will need to purchase a rectal thermometer made by ""Q-tip"". BE SURE THAT YOU GET THIS BRAND! When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes, and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed during your therapy.  Change to very comfortable clothing, such as a sweat suit, and lie down on your bed. Open the package containing the thermometer, remove the thermometer and carefully place it on the bedside table so that it will not become chipped or broken.  Take the written material that accompanies the thermometer and as you read it, you will notice in small print the statement that says, ""Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is PERSONALLY tested.""  Now.... close your eyes and say out loud five times, ""I am so glad that I do not work in quality control at the Q-tip company.""

The transport delivery off HPLC was  shorted to keep Entex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport  imbalance was to be cleared the next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of  1999, but 91,297 MMBtu still remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC  Index for the upcoming months so that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can  clear this imbalance. We will need to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the  purchase from ENA by 91,297  MMBtu for that month.  I need you to watch over whoever is doing the Reliant  Energy - Entex allocation to  make sure this happens.

"Your list of items is correct.  However, the entex related transport shows up  on the P&L and the GL via transport expense from Tom to Ed.  This number is  manually booked to the GL each month by Phillip.  Therefore, this revenue  shows up en masse with all of the marketing desk's expense.  Eric        Enron North America Corp.

Also, do we do anything for the  industrial volume?  I think we ought to let people know that we accomplished  this (albeit that we did this a long time ago).  Please let me know.  Ed asked me to find revenue from Entex for transportation expense to  Lufkin/Diboll for the residential part of the contract (Transaction 10).   After checking into it, we have all found the following things:  1. Howard allocates the Lufkin/Diboll meters (7107/8/9) based on actuals. 2. Howard receives allocations from Entex for the industrial volumes, and  then backs into the Transaction 10 (residential) volumes for Lufkin/Diboll. 3. Howard allocates the residential piece for Lufkin/Diboll to Transaction 10. 4. Kyle bills Entex for the residential volume, and applies the cash to the  sales invoice. 5. Cassandra cuts an invoice to Co. 16 to get reimbursed for the transport  expense going up to Lufkin/Diboll for the residential volume. 6. The money lands in Ed's P&L for the residential piece of the transport  reimbursement.  Right now, at the end of the month, Eric Bass tells Mick how much the  transport reimbursement is and Mick includes that money in Ed's P&L as  revenue from a third party.

Subject:         Winning the Cultural War by Charlton Heston    Date:         Tue, 16 Mar 1999 20:47:56 -0600    From:         ""Koenig's International News"" <bill@watch.org>      To:         watch-news@watch.org    Note from Bill Koenig:  Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard. Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a copy.  It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.  ************  I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten class what his father did for a living. ""My Daddy,"" he said, ""pretends to be people."" There have been quite a few of them. Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.  As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, ""We are now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure."" Those words are true again. I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart. I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into the miracle that it is.  Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I serve as a moving target for the media who've called me everything from ""ridiculous"" and ""duped"" to a ""brain-injured, senile, crazy old man."" I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable thoughts and speech are mandated.  For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 -- long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.  I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.  I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.  Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.  >From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially saying, ""Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are using language not authorized for public consumption!""  But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the  British crown.  In his book, ""The End of Sanity,"" Martin Gross writes that ""blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every direction.  Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something, without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right from wrong. And they don't like it.""  Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ... all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the state commissioner announced that health providers who are HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that they are infected.  At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the school team ""The Tribe"" because it was supposedly insulting to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs truly like the name.  In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing sex change surgery.  In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students. Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said ""Negroes."" Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said ""black."" But it's a no-no now.  For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly ""Native-American."" I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American ... with a capital letter on ""American."" Finally, just last month ... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public Advocate, used the word ""niggardly"" while talking to colleagues about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and resign.  As columnist Tony Snow wrote: ""David Howard got fired because some people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their ignorance."" What does all of this mean? It means that telling us what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling us what to do can't be far behind.  Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did political correctness originate on America's campuses? And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?  Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the halls of reason.  You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your counterparts across the land, are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.  And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by your grandfathers' standards-cowards.  Here's another example. Right now at more than one major university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.  I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought and expression lay down your arms and plead, ""Don't shoot me."" If you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.  Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do? How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?  The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.  I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great man who led those in the right against those with the might.  Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that protested a war in Vietnam.  In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.  But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma. You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining, but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me. Let me tell you a story.  A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling a CD called ""Cop Killer"" celebrating ambushing and murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world. Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one had been murdered. But Time/Warner was stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.  I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend. What I did there was against the advice of my family and colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full lyrics of ""Cop Killer""-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.  ""I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF...""  It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.  Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. ""SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ....""  Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I left the room in echoing silence.  When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said ""We can't print that."" ""I know,"" I replied, ""but Time/Warner _s selling it.""  Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act, not just talk.  When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment ...march on that school and block its doorways.  When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott their magazine and the products it advertises.

Subject:         Winning the Cultural War by Charlton Heston    Date:         Tue, 16 Mar 1999 20:47:56 -0600    From:         ""Koenig's International News"" <bill@watch.org>      To:         watch-news@watch.org    Note from Bill Koenig:  Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard. Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a copy.  It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.  ************  I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten class what his father did for a living. ""My Daddy,"" he said, ""pretends to be people."" There have been quite a few of them. Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.  As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, ""We are now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure."" Those words are true again. I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart. I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into the miracle that it is.  Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I serve as a moving target for the media who've called me everything from ""ridiculous"" and ""duped"" to a ""brain-injured, senile, crazy old man."" I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable thoughts and speech are mandated.  For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 -- long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.  I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.  I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.  Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.  >From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially saying, ""Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are using language not authorized for public consumption!""  But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the  British crown.  In his book, ""The End of Sanity,"" Martin Gross writes that ""blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every direction.  Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something, without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right from wrong. And they don't like it.""  Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ... all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the state commissioner announced that health providers who are HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that they are infected.  At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the school team ""The Tribe"" because it was supposedly insulting to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs truly like the name.  In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing sex change surgery.  In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students. Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said ""Negroes."" Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said ""black."" But it's a no-no now.  For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly ""Native-American."" I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American ... with a capital letter on ""American."" Finally, just last month ... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public Advocate, used the word ""niggardly"" while talking to colleagues about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and resign.  As columnist Tony Snow wrote: ""David Howard got fired because some people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their ignorance."" What does all of this mean? It means that telling us what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling us what to do can't be far behind.  Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did political correctness originate on America's campuses? And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?  Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the halls of reason.  You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your counterparts across the land, are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.  And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by your grandfathers' standards-cowards.  Here's another example. Right now at more than one major university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.  I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought and expression lay down your arms and plead, ""Don't shoot me."" If you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.  Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do? How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?  The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.  I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great man who led those in the right against those with the might.  Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that protested a war in Vietnam.  In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.  But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma. You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining, but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me. Let me tell you a story.  A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling a CD called ""Cop Killer"" celebrating ambushing and murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world. Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one had been murdered. But Time/Warner was stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.  I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend. What I did there was against the advice of my family and colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full lyrics of ""Cop Killer""-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.  ""I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF...""  It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.  Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. ""SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ....""  Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I left the room in echoing silence.  When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said ""We can't print that."" ""I know,"" I replied, ""but Time/Warner _s selling it.""  Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act, not just talk.  When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment ...march on that school and block its doorways.  When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott their magazine and the products it advertises.  So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by God's grace, built this country.  If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.  Thank you.         - att1.htm ",brettlawler@hotmail.com,eric.bass@enron.com,Fw: Winning the cultural war,2000-02-07 09:02:00-08:00,sent

So many things and PEOPLE to talk about and only  one Friday State of the Union to cover it all.  Everyone just relax because  its going to be a long one.  As Always, Brace Yourself.  Where to begin?  How about those Tigers?  They are on track to be the SEC  West Basketball Champions.  Who would have thought it? Kristin, my younger  sister who is a freshman, says LSU is like ""Spring Break Everyday!""  That's  great!  I'm sure the students at Harvard say the same thing when their teams  are on a winning streak.  Geaux Tigers!  Forget Engagements how about Shot-Gun Weddings!  I recently learned that,  while making a weekend trip to New Orleans, my high school sweet heart,  Sarah, got ""Tanked"" in the French Quarter and found herself in the middle of  the Pat O Brian's  Piano Bar in front of a minister saying ""I DO"" to her  boyfriend, now husband, Brandt.  On such short notice, they were unable to  find a reception hall to celebrate the wedding, so the family just celebrated  all night at Dante's Pizza.  I hear it was one hell of a party.   Congratulations Sarah!  Speaking of good parties, the DC Mardi Gras Balls were incredible.  I'd like  to take this time to once again thank my buddy, Chris, for taking me and  Kenny K with him.  If you enjoy Politics like I do, its a must see event.   The two things that stick mostly in my mind are:  The last night of the ball  after several cocktails, Granola Centola staggering over to Senator Mary  Landrieu and saying,""Mrs. Clinton, will you dance with me to New Orleans  Lady?""  That Larry, he's paving the path for his political future------a  regular James Carville!  I also had the opportunity to ask the ever-so-shy  Edwin Edwards a question - ""Governor who do you like in the President's  Race?""  He responded, ""Have the odds come out already?!?""  No doubt a man of  true character.  I hear times are tough for my friends down in Shreveport.  Brandon, a full  time med school student, has been moonlighting during his free time.  He  decided to put his ""Three on the top, two on the sides, don't touch the back,  Jack, haircut "" to work on the Internet.  He's currently modelling his sweet  hair style as ""Mullet of the Week""  at http://www.mulletsgalore.com/ .  He  gets 50 cents every time the site is hit, so take the time and visit the site  to help an aspiring doctor.  February was a good month and things are pretty good at the homefront.  I  still haven't found the girl of my dreams, but neither has my roommate,  Matt.

TOM $124,002 GREG      $9,285  I started the process by pulling all the meters and associated transport  rates off the transport capacity tickets.  I pulled them based on the  delivery rates being greater than the matrix.  I then researched the deals to  pull the deal tickets.  If the deal occurred before 7/99, then I assigned the  expense to Tom.  If the deal occurred after 7/99, then I looked at who the  dealmaker was and based the assignment of the transport expense on who the  dealmaker was.  In all cases, either Papayoti or Lamphier did the deal.  I also trued up the transport rate to the transport rate on the deal ticket.   This includes occasions when the transport capacity ticket did not have a  transport rate but the transport capacity ticket had an increased rate.  In  other words, I defaulted to the deal ticket so that we could have a paper  record of the transport rate.  As of now, I still have to pull January volume and attach the rate to the  March transport.  I wanted to go through the full analysis first and now that  I have the actual transport rate from the deal ticket, I know which rate to  attach.  I will pursue these avenues next.  Please let me know what questions you have.   Heidi  PS Details are attached.     ",brenda.herod@enron.com,eric.bass@enron.com,Re: Market Meters Breakout,2000-03-16 02:41:00-08:00,sent

The intent of this period (quick overview) is  to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.   This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month  increments.  It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to  the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with  Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled  internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara  bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be  heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These  trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.  An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and  Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human  intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this  nature will have to be entered manually.  How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL  product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.   The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what  is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal  accordingly.    For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:    Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara  ticket      Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07    04/10  04/14    04/17  04/21    04/24  04/28      Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing   Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.   Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open  ended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date  is on the path; otherwise  the number of reconciling items will increase.  Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.  Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.

"Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.   60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly  basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.  For example:  Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.  This means that:  Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000 Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000  Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000) So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)  Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been  previously recognized. Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.   Call with questions.

"Melissa,  As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated  from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation,  it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly  ""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the  realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of  accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals  that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes  greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and  value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.

From:  Eric Bass                           04/14/2000 11:58 AM    To: Melissa Graves/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Susan Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT, George Weissman/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income  Melissa,  As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated  from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation,  it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly  ""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the  realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of  accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals  that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes  greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and  value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp  will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes  greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will  keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed  to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this  value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a  breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

As a result of this segregation,  it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly  ""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the  realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of  accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals  that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes  greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and  value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp  will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes  greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.

Eric, our biggest concern with this right now is the valuation for the  Products that you would see in your Position Summary. We know that is we  passed these trades through the system as a straight month-long transaction,  that the valuation would be wrong. Additionally, the start and end dates will  skue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of  the month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the  month falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to  get you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent  to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built.  In short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We  will get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close  these Position Values will be.   Also, can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product  during bid week?

Dreaming frees the soul, energizes the spirit and allows you to do things that would get your ass thrown in jail if you really tried them.  Love means never having to say, ""Does that twenty include the spanking?  To truly love another, you must first love yourself. And it wouldn't kill you to wash your hands in between either.  A little bit of love goes a long way in our lives. It can provide us with higher highs and lower lows. But, if it comes with a persistent burning sensation, see your physician.  When it becomes a crime to love, you should probably consider dating outside the family.  If Life hands you lemons today, smile and give thanks. Then when Life isn't looking, give him a quick knee to the groin. That'll learn him.  They say a smile is a gift which is free to the giver and precious to the recipient.

The dollar amount  involved are quite minor.  I believe, on a going forward basis, the large Coastal negative number  ($92,233) will disappear beginning on 4/1/2000.  As we discussed, would you  therefore provide us with your wellhead accrual income data for April, 2000  so we can see the net effect of correcting the Coastal booking?  Thanks.

Tuesday, May 30    Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word     ?                        ? By Andy Katz  ESPN.com    With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere  between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential  of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.    NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking  heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft  camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of  talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several  projections we'll have on ESPN.com.    A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but  could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing  in Chicago.    The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a  chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center  Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason  Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard  Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point  guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State  junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey  forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.    Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next  month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must  decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until  June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and  Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what  happens.    ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock  draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.          Chris Mihm    Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.    1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and  could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets  could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next  season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.    2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be  getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player  in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer.  Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the  Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.    3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have  already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward  (which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him  defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to  return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door  open for a return.    4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center  for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next  in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better  offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.    5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles  but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic  an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last  season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.    6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on  Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better  scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta  wants a small forward over a big guard.    7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can  package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be  solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy  McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would  have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.    8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the  third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too,  but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for  size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are  split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.    9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go  higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce  during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson,  DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over  a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.    10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.):  The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their  three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has  scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without  feeling pressured to play him next season.    11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past  11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but  can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from  Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much  different.    12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don  Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the  Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a  foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts  and in Chicago -- if he shows.    13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to  take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough  to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the  point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching  because of his leadership and toughness.    14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't  let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next  to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go  higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.    15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power  forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift.  None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a  rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the  Pacers.    16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a  backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under  any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind  Cleaves.     17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed,  he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit  all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the  Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement  Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs.     18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers  need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that  some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of  being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.    19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up  into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will  catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of  his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The  Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.    20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have  already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off  the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first  round, regardless of where he's being picked.    21. Toronto -- Craig ""Speedy"" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have  already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If  Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural  pick for the Raptors.    22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some  heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical  players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big.  Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.    23. Utah -- Hanno M""tt""l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with  picking M""tt""l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end  up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small  forward. If M""tt""l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first  round.    24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point  guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most  intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard  positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the  Bulls some versatility on the floor.    25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another  big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor  together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns  have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.    26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism  and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason.  Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could  still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.    27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave  reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early  without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers  have a history of going younger in the draft.    28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers  don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to  jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking  skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many  miles left in his legs.    29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's  where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or  Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the  Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.    Andy Katz is a senior writer at ESPN.com.     ?

Some atheist goes to a high  school football game, hears a kid say a short prayer before the game and gets  offended.?

Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so  going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really  think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side  thought- when in the hell am I going to study for the CPA- especially since I  have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You  do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my  job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.  I  am feeling a little stressed/anxious today for some reason- in case you  didn't pick up on that.  I definately feel like I need a vacation.

Waters ****************************************************************   You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your  bedroom door.   Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled  whispers. At least two people have broken into your house  and are moving your way.   With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed  and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the  chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.   In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a  weapon--it looks like a crowbar.   When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the  shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor.  One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to  the front door and lurches outside.   As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're  in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years  before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently  regulated as to make them useless.  Yours was never registered.   Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.  They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal  Possession of a Firearm.   When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry:  authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter.  ""What kind of sentence will I get?"" you ask.  ""Only ten-to-twelve years,"" he replies, as if that's nothing.  ""Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven.""   The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local  newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric  vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir  boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say  about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities  acknowledge that both ""victims"" have been arrested numerous  times. But the next day's headline says it all:  ""Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die."" The thieves have  been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type  pranksters.   As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media  picks it up, then the international media.   The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney  says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.   The media publishes reports that your home has been  burglarized several times in the past and that you've been  critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the  suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you  would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to  allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.   A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been  reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When  you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works  against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean,  vengeful man.   It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.   The judge sentences you to life in prison.  __________________________________________   This case really happened.  ***********************************  On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England,  killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was  convicted and is now serving a life term.   How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the  once-great British Empire?   It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly  reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and  established that handgun sales were to be made only to those  who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing  to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.  Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of  any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of  all shotguns.   Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after  the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a  mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down  the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared,  17 people were dead.   The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of ""gun  control"", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all  privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan  used a rifle.)   Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used  a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at  a public school.   For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as  mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real  kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day,  week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and  demanded a total ban on all handguns.  The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the  few sidearms still owned by private citizens.   During the years in which the British government incrementally  took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right  to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities  refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened,  claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to  own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were  charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the  Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, ""We  cannot have people take the law into their own hands.""   All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and  several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young  thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a  collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or  stolen by burglars.   When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns  were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.  Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few  who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year  prison sentences if they didn't comply.   Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns  from private citizens.   How did the authorities know who had handguns?   The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars.

'   that when you're in love, it shows.     that just one person saying to me, ""You've made my day!"" makes my day.     that having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most peaceful feelings in     the world.  I've learned....     that being kind is more important than being right.     that you should never say no to a gift from a child.     that I can always pray for someone when I don't have the strength to help him in  some other way.  I've learned....     that no matter how serious your life requires you to be, everyone needs a friend  to act goofy with.     that sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to understand.     that simple walks with my father around the block on summer nights when I was     a child did wonders for me as an adult.  I've learned....     that life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the end, the faster it   goes.     that we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for.     that money doesn't buy class.     that it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.  I've learned....     that under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be appreciated and     loved.     that the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think  I can?     that to ignore the facts does not change the facts.     that when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting that person  continue to hurt you.  I've learned....     that love, not time, heals all wounds.     that the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround myself with    people smarter than I am.     that everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.     that there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feeling their   breath on your cheeks.  I've learned....     that no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.     that life is tough, but I'm tougher.     that opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.     that when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.  I've learned....     that one should keep his words both soft and tender, because tomorrow he may     have to eat them.     that a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.     that I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.  I've learned....     that when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his little fist, that   you're hooked for life.     that everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and     growth occurs while you're climbing it.     that it is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it is requested and   when it is a life-threatening situation.     that the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.

"I will be happy to help.    Mike, please give me a call at 3-0977 and we can set up a time that is good  for you to observe.  Eric        Enron North America Corp.    From:  Brenda F Herod                           07/26/2000 01:14 PM    To: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Baumbach/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Steve Venturatos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael Taylor/ENRON@Gateway, George  Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: I need your help!!  Michael Taylor is a summer intern from LSU, finance major, who has been  working in Logistics for the Central Desk.  He will be at ENA for the next  couple of weeks (through 8/11, I believe).  He has not had an opportunity to  really see our business from the trading perspective or Risk perspective.  I  had the opportunity to have lunch with Mike yesterday, and we brainstormed on  some options to get him some exposure to these areas prior to leaving ENA.   THis where I need your help!  Eric - As I always do, I sang your praises to Mike, and I thought you would  be a good person for Mike to sit with to observe your current role in the  analyst program on the Texas Trading Desk.  Additionally, since you were in  Risk also, I thought you could give him an insightful perspective of how the  Risk experience has helped you to move to your current role.  If you can  swing it, I think it would be great if Mike could sit with you one day, and  you could explain to him your job, your thoughts behind your actions, the  data you watch, etc.  Obviously, the intent is educational, not  interference.  So I will leave it to the two of you to work out the best  approach and timing.  Dave - As I mentioned to you yesterday, I sang your praises also to Mike, and  I'm glad the two of you were able to meet.  As we discussed, Mike would like  to have some exposure to the Risk role, so it would be nice if he could sit  with the group when the books and position are being calced.  I will leave it  to the two of you to coordinate the day.  Mike's current role in Logistics brings him into the office at 4:00am to  prepare the morning report.  As I understand it, his responsibilities are  critical up until trading.  So late morning and early afternoon might be the  best time, but you all can work through it.  When he sits with Risk, he'll  probably go home and them return when you all start calcing.  George - Obviously Mike's first responsibilities are to Central Logistics,  and these other opportunities are really on his own time.  We just thought it  would be good for him to have a Risk/Trading perspective when he is trying to  evaluate job opportunities.  I appreciate your support in this, but please  let me know if you have any concerns.  When Mike leaves Enron, he will be going to Seattle to participate in  MicroSoft's co-op program for the reaminder of 2000.  Obviously, he will have  a great company to compare us to but at the end of the day, we want to ensure  he has a great perspective on the opportunities that Enron can offer.  I  appreciate your time to help Mike.    ",brenda.herod@enron.com,eric.bass@enron.com,Re: I need your help!!,2000-07-26 09:23:00-07:00,sent

"Two boys are playing football near Fayetteville, AR, when one of the boys is attacked by a rabid Rottweiler.  Thinking quickly, the other boy rips a board off of a nearby fence, wedges it down the dog's collar and twists, breaking the dog's neck and saving his friend's life.  A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident and rushes over to interview the boy.  ""YOUNG RAZORBACK FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM VICIOUS ANIMAL"" he starts writing in his notebook.  ""But I'm not a Razorback fan,"" the little hero replies. ""Sorry,"" says the reporter, ""since you live near Fayetteville, I just assumed you were.""  The reporter begins writing again, ""BRAVE ARKANSAS STATE FAN RESCUES FRIEND FROM HORRIFIC ATTACK.""  The boy replies, ""I'm not an Arkansas State fan, either.""  ""Oh. I assumed that everyone in Arkansas was either a Razorback fan or an Arkansas State fan.  You must be a University  of Central Arkansas fan.""  The reporter starts writing again ""YOUNG UCA FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM MAD DOG.""  The boy said, ""I'm not a UCA fan either.""  ""Well, if you are not for the U of A, State, or UCA, just what team DO you root for?"" the reporter asked.  ""Why, I'm an LSU fan!"" the child replies.

The Guardian newspaper reports that ""The Muslim's Handbook,"" written by retired cleric Kemil Gubran, advised men not to hit too hard and to avoid the face. It also said that if a man's wife is ill and he can't afford a servant, he could take a second wife.    The book was published by the state-funded Pious Foundation, which is affiliated with Turkey's religious directorate. In the past decade, the directorate -- which appoints Muslim clerics and dictates topics for mosques -- has been presenting a modern interpretation of Islam to include expanded roles and rights for women.    ""I am outraged that such a book was published with state funds, with money women paid in taxes,"" said Zuhal Krilic, the head of Kader, a group promoting women in politics.    A book published in Spain several weeks ago also said a Muslim man could beat his wife -- and included tips and instructions -- although it counseled that the best way to bring a woman in line was through verbal abuse.

The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our  esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first  game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably  wouldn't have won anyway.    Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this  means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule. Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the  location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field  next Wednesday night.

The grasshopper thinks  the ant is a   fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant   is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out   in the cold.     MODERN VERSION:    The ant works hard in the withering  heat all summer long, building his   house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks   he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter,   the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why   the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while  others are cold and   starving.

Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah  with the grasshopper, and everybody cries   when they sing ""It's Not Easy Being  Green.""    Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening   News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they   can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by   those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to   it as ""Temperatures of the 80's""    Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in  front of the ant's house where the   news stations film the group singing ""We shall overcome."" Jesse then has the   group kneel down to pray to God for  the grasshopper's sake.    Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten   rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls  for an immediate tax hike   on the ant to make him pay his ""fair share.""    Finally, the EEOC drafts the ""Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act,""    retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is  fined for failing to   hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having  nothing left to   pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by  the government.    Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation   suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a  panel of federal   judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients   who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM when   there are no talk shows scheduled.    The ant loses the case. The story  ends as we see the grasshopper finishing   up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is   in,which just happens to be the ant's old  house, crumbles around him since   he doesn't maintain it.    The ant has  disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper   bought by selling  most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton   standing before a wildly  applauding group of Democrats announcing that a   new era of ""fairness"" has dawned  in America.    The grasshopper is found dead in a drug-related incident and  the house, now   abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the  once   peaceful neighborhood.   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  MORE  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Sister Margaret died and through some error found herself in hell.

No  matter how you may want to spell TEAM.. there is no ""I"" in it.  Mel  Lessons of the Geese   This Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in  ""V"" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they  fly that way.   FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an ""uplift"" for the bird  immediately following. By flying in a ""V"" formation, the whole flock has at  least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own. LESSON: People who share a common direction and sense of community can get  where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on  the thrust of one another.   FACT: When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and  resistance of trying to go it alone. It quickly gets back into formation to  take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it. LESSON: If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with  those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and  give our help to others. It is harder to do something alone than together.   FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and  another goose flies to the point position. LESSON: It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and  sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent of each others  skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.   FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up  front to keep up their speed. LESSON: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups where  there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of  encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart  and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek. We need to make sure  our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.   FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will  drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and  protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly  again. Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch  up with their flock. LESSON: If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and  each other in difficult times as well as in good!    ~ Written by Angeles Arrien ~       ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________  Message: 3    Date: Sun, 10 Sep 2000 14:32:50 -0400    From: Sandra Anderson <sandraan@concentric.net> Subject: Any of ya's ????

Mel    Dog bites threaten home insurance Homeowner coverage may be cancelled if your pooch is considered too aggressive   Charles V. Tines / The Detroit News  MetLife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other  dogs with attitudes.  By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief      A sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in Metro  Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner  policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.     At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto & Home, no longer  writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of  large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German  shepherds and bull terriers.     ""Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your  household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to  match the risk with the rate,"" said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife  vice-president.     ""Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly.""     The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now  shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites --  from medical treatment to ""pain and suffering"" damage awards.     A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent  of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has  bitten someone.     ""We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers,""  said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350  companies nationwide.     ""Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot  more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up.""     Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported  1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996.     Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a  year earlier.     The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said  the number of bites there remained constant at about 800.     Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7  million dog bites were reported in 1997.     Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of  victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat. It took  12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.     ""It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem,"" said his  father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly  at the neighbor's house.     ""I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and  went for his throat.""     The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly  half of all children will be bitten by age 12.     Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance,  said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a  particular concern. Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy  mills, he said.     ""More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls  this year simply because there are so many more of them,"" he said.     ""But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull. The  increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive  animals.     ""People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often  don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the  mailman. Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that  are suing.""     Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service  now is routinely suing dog owners.      Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles ""quite a  few"" dog bite claims and he has seen ""a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly  by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood.""     He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that  say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.     ""There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are  bitten by dogs,"" Bernstein said.     State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance,  said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996.     ""For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the  amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm,"" said John Carroll, a company  spokesman.     The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and  another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.     ""We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to  bite,"" Carroll said. ""But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the  situation.     ""The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on  premises.""

Major Applewhite was erratic = in=20 his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20 miraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see= =20 what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20 =09 =09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20 =09 =09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac= k=20 Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of= =20 his experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. = He=20 said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to = me=20 that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense, lig= ht=20 it up and get on a roll when you are alternating, but I'll continue to watc= h=20 like everyone else. =20 =09 =09I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli= na=20 with success. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf)= ,=20 Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t= o=20 prepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passing. With Simms and=20 Applewhite you pretty much get the same style. With Keldorf and Davenport,= =20 you also had injuries dictate a few starts.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Can you tell us what influenced Mack Brown's decision regarding the= =20 quarterbacks against Stanford?=20 =09?? Nels Marshall=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Here are Brown's exact words: ""Experience. We were in a tight= =20 football game and Major (Applewhite) has been around a long time. I was pro= ud=20 - even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter - that = we=20 didn't panic. I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job= =20 of coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look= =20 like it is trying because they're nervous. Instead, they are trying too har= d=20 and get uptight. Our team tried hard. As negative as people make Saturday= =20 night, it is one of those things that you have to grow from."" =20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: I'm glad we have two great QBs. My question is, are the receivers ha= ving=20 any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a=20 left-handed or right-handed QB?=20 =09?? Dave Stastny, Austin=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch= ing=20 the ball. They do, however, say that Chris Simms' ball will come a little= =20 faster and a little harder than Major Applewhite's.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea= r.=20 What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know= =20 that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons, but can they al= so=20 apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount = of=20 time? =20 =09?? Chad Graham=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  No. Once a freshman plays in a game, even for one play and he d= oes=20 not suffer a season-ending injury, the chance for a redshirt is out the=20 window. =20 =09? =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09[IMAGE]=20 =09Jermain Anderson =20 =09 =09Q: Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b= ack=20 to linebacker? If I remember correctly, he played LB in high school at Texa= s=20 City. He seems to still have good speed, but also a problem putting on the= =20 necessary weight to play defensive end. It just seems like he might be bett= er=20 suited for the outside linebacker rotation, especially considering the=20 progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton, Cole Pittman and= =20 Adam Doiron. =20 =09 ?? Micah Hurt=20 =09 =09 =09 =09 BROWN:  Coaches don't think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker. = They=20 are pleased with the depth at linebacker, as well. They like Anderson's=20 instincts as a pass rusher. They are still working on his ability to stop t= he=20 run.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn= =20 football schedule in your letter each week. My husband, Mark, is a diehard= =20 Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he h= as=20 remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner= =20 fans. Of course, he does his fair share (and probably more) of bragging abo= ut=20 the Longhorns. =20 =09?? Barbara and Mark Harper=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  As far as the schedule, UT's remaining games are:=20 =09 =09Sept. 23 (home) vs. Houston at 6 p.m. on Fox =09Sept. 30 (home) vs. Oklahoma State at 11 a.m. on ABC =09Oct. 7 (in Dallas) vs. Oklahoma, TBA =09Oct. 14 at Colorado, TBA =09Oct. 21 (home) vs. Missouri, TBA =09Oct. 28 (home) vs. Baylor, TBA =09Nov. 4 at Texas Tech, TBA =09Nov. 11 at Kansas, TBA =09Nov. 24 (home) vs. Texas A=02?at 2:30 p.m. on ABC=20 =09Since you all have access to the Internet, log onto UT's sports Web site= =20 (texassports.com) and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your= =20 area. And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at=20 dallasnews.com.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me=  the=20 number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads (i.e.= =20 how's Cedric Woodard, Aaron Humphrey, Kwame Cavil). Thanks.=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  The Big 12 office just released a list of former Texas players = in=20 the NFL. However, it includes some players who have been released. For=20 example, Aaron Humphrey was released after a free-agent tryout with Tampa= =20 Bay. Chris Smith was released after a free-agent tryout with Washington and= =20 Dallas. Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota=20 Vikings. Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted. Anyway,= =20 here is the list as provided by the Big 12: =09 =09TEXAS (21) =09Ben Adams, OL, Miami =09Taje Allen, DB, St. Louis =09Tony Brackens, DE, Jacksonville =09Blake Brockermeyer, OG, Chicago =09Ricky Brown, RB, Cincinnati =09Chris Carter, DB, New England =09Kwame Cavil, WR, Buffalo =09Phil Dawson, KS, Cleveland =09Shane Dronett, DL, Atlanta =09Priest Holmes, RB, Baltimore =09Aaron Humphrey, DE, Tampa Bay =09Jay Humphrey, OL, Minnesota =09Derek Lewis, TE, St. Louis =09Wane McGarity, WR, Dallas =09Eric Metcalf, WR, Carolina =09Dan Neil, OL, Denver =09Roger Roesler, OL, Cincinnati =09Chris Smith, TE, Dallas =09Winfred Tubbs, LB, San Francisco =09Bryant Westbrook, DB, Detroit =09Ricky Williams, RB, New Orleans =09Cedric Woodard, DL, Baltimore=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09[IMAGE]=20 =09Hodges Mitchell =20 =09 =09Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y= our=20 column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and= =20 wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.= =20 However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team ""up"" sometime= s=20 and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20 =09 =09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible = for=20 the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on= e,=20 I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges= =20 Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis= =20 love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of= =20 those yards were ""move=20 =09 =09 the chains"" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=  and=20 protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but= =20 all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th= e=20 run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20 =09 =09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive= =20 tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t= he=20 linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there= =20 with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a= =20 receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver. =09 =09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim= e=20 against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury= =20 may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up= =20 with opponent's wideouts. =09 =09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=  all=20 over the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i= s=20 up with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does=20 Stockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca= n=20 anyone at UT block? =09 =09Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several tim= es=20 the camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you ru= n=20 up the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll pla= y=20 against?=20 =09?? Andrew Bowen=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20 incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday= 's=20 events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat= =20 the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any= =20 other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20 learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20 =09 =09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a= nd=20 needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20 fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl= y=20 isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di= d=20 beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop= s,=20 and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question= =20 about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe= d=20 on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t= he=20 team.=20 =09 =09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the= =20 quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still= =20 working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'= s=20 no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are= =20 the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the= =20 line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20 Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.= =20 =09 =09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it = was=20 taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about= =20 that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20 deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20 blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20 Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20 =09 =09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in= =20 games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.= =20 The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl= =20 Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl= e=20 who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B= ut=20 that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because= =20 one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed = to=20 block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play= er=20 has been chewed out every which way. =09 =09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow= n,=20 who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa= y=20 anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still= =20 have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so= =20 early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20 constructively or destructively.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding= . I=20 know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player = in=20 the country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against= =20 teams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. M= y=20 question is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker= =20 where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized= =20 and average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our=20 recruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20 =09?? Ernie McAnally=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov= e.=20 But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel= d=20 right away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) i= s=20 perfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. I= n=20 time, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But the= re=20 is no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big play= s=20 against Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and=20 blocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season a= nd=20 the next two years, he should only get better.=20 =09? =09 =09 Q: I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the= =20 announcers  stated that TCU had anted up $90,000 for the Heisman campaign f= or=20 LaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky=20 Williams' run for the Heisman?=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few= =20 postcards, a video and a CD-ROM screen saver to send out to the national=20 media detailing Ricky's accomplishments. But those costs totaled less than= =20 $10,000, according to UT officials.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Did any of the freshman who did not play in the Louisiana-Lafayette = game=20 play in the Stanford game? I am watching to see which ones might be=20 redshirts. =20 =09?? Mike Smith, Houston=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  According to the participation chart provided at the Stanford-T= exas=20 game, Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh= o=20 did not play against Louisiana-Lafayette. In addition to Sendlein, here are= =20 the other freshmen who have played so far: WRs Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson a= nd=20 Sloan Thomas; TE Brock Edwards; DE Kalen Thornton; CB Nathan Vasher; FS=20 Phillip Geiggar; and DT Stevie Lee.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Is it true that in Mack Brown's four or five head coaching stops, hi= s=20 teams have yet to win a single conference championship? Since UT has lost= =20 four out of its last five games, wouldn't a loss to Houston this week=20 officially end Mack Brown's honeymoon with the alumni, notwithstanding his= =20 abundant PR program? With Brown about to land his third national Top 5=20 recruiting class, I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie= s=20 to go with those recruiting victories. =20 =09?? T. Hough=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  It's true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i= n=20 stints at Appalachian State, Tulane, North Carolina and now Texas. At=20 Appalachian State, Tulane and UNC, he was taking over absolutely dead=20 programs. He took Tulane to a bowl, and he had Florida State to deal with i= n=20 the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC. But he took UNC to six bowl gam= es=20 in his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.=20 =09 =09A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas=20 faithful. But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot= =20 seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha= s=20 done beating Nebraska (twice), Oklahoma (twice) and Texas A=02?(once) in hi= s=20 first two seasons here. He has also turned Texas back into a destination=20 school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together. In=20 addition to all that, he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha= n=20 probably most Texas fans realize.=20 =09 =09Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden, John Cooper, Lloyd C= arr,=20 Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer. Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t= he=20 eyes of fans. It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha= t.=20 UNC fans were pretty ho-hum about everything the Tar Heels did in football,= =20 even when they won big. Brown wanted to win at a school with huge=20 expectations. He'll have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti= ng=20 out the next few seasons in the Top 10.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game?=20 =09?? Marty Bonner=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe= red=20 against Stanford. He may also miss the Oklahoma State game. Mack Brown said= =20 this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball= =20 really well.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Is Ricky Williams' jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S= ept.=20 30?=20 =09?? Mark Wilson=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Yes. Williams' No. 34 will be retired at that game. Williams ha= s=20 said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend.= =20 Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th= at=20 will be available soon.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team = after=20 the loss to Stanford?=20 =09?? Virginia Blair=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Again, here are Mack's words: ""I said during the pre-season tha= t we=20 were overrated. I didn't see any reason with the youth, the way we finished= =20 last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a= =20 Top 5 football team. One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv= e=20 a tremendous amount of attention and publicity, but in some cases people wa= nt=20 to push you too fast to get to the top. I think that we were in that positi= on=20 and expectations got out of hand. I knew that we would have a difficult gam= e=20 at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win. I also didn't think= =20 that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country.

It contains video showing=20 Ricky breaking about 10 records, a panoramic tour of the UT football=20 facilities, Ricky Williams personal scrapbooks, his rings and trophies in 3= D,=20 and a few other notable features.

Now, a year later, he hasn't gotten a sniff at real playing time = at=20 tailback. What happened to tailback by committee? It seems like we could us= e=20 a bigger back (given the lack of blocking prowess by the O-line).=20 =09?? Bob Nance=20 =09 =09 =09 =09 BROWN:  Good question. The coaches took a good look at everyone in the= =20 Houston game. They came away thinking that Kenny Hayter needs some more=20 carries. They still think that Ivan Williams is developing the toughness=20 needed to run in college. In the Louisiana-Lafayette game, coaches thought = he=20 was running tentatively.=20 =09 =09Just as an aside, Hodges Mitchell says the running game is going to cut = loose=20 this week. He says this season has been just like last season. For three=20 games, the running game has been Nikes stuck in glue. But he says this week= =20 is the week. If it is, there would be no better confidence-builder than to = do=20 it against the nation's top rushing defense. OSU is giving up just 30.3 yar= ds=20 per game rushing this season. (Texas is fourth nationally against the run,= =20 yielding 47.0 ypg). I think it will be tough sledding for the UT RBs this= =20 week. Should be a good passing game, though.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Many of us who discuss this frequently still question the play-calli= ng on=20 offense, and feel that Texas can never win a national championship with Gre= g=20 Davis as offensive coordinator. Any comments?=20 =09?? Reggie Reeves=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Davis is not the problem. His offenses routinely rate among the= =20 nation's best in either rushing, passing or total offense. This season, UT = is=20 fourth nationally in pass offense (366.5 yards per game). The running game= =20 stinks. But he has gotten the passing game to the top with a quarterback=20 rotation that appears to have kept both Major Applewhite and Chris Simms fr= om=20 peaking and with receivers who are barely old enough to shave.=20 =09 =09Davis is in constant contact with Gary Kubiak of the Denver Broncos. The= =20 Broncos are considered one of the most cutting-edge offenses in the NFL.=20 Davis is constantly tapping into Kubiak and trying to bring in new wrinkles= =20 to the UT offense. I don't know if anyone works harder than he does. Plus,= =20 the quarterbacks love him. Even if they don't love this rotation, they love= =20 him. I have seen no signs that this rotation has eroded that relationship. =09 =09Davis is solid. In fact, if there is a UT coach who could leave the staf= f in=20 the near future for a head job or head coordinator job in the NFL, it's Gre= g=20 Davis.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: In your first newsletter I asked you why is everyone so excited abou= t=20 this year's team when they showed last year that they could not run the=20 football. Against the big boys, you better have more balance. You replied= =20 that the line is one year older and should be better. No, Chip, sorry, but= =20 they are less than a year older since they struggled at the end of the seas= on=20 with running and picking up blitzes. Now, not to say I told you so, but it = is=20 still a serious problem that you sports writers overlooked and got too caug= ht=20 up in the QB hype and the great receiving corps. Shame on you.=20 =09 =09Maybe that offensive line is not as great as you guys thought? I see UT = going=20 8-3 this year and hanging around at 15th, which is where they should be. Th= ey=20 are still young and not hungry enough as evidenced by poor starts against= =20 really bad teams. Horn fans and sportswriters need to be a bit more patient= =20 this year and take off their blinders. Maybe being a sportswriter during my= =20 days at UT helped me see through the hype. Hook'em! =20 =09?? Larry, Dallas=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I thought this offensive line would be much better than it's sh= own=20 this season, but I wouldn't give up on them. Everyone saw UT's third=20 possession against Houston in which Leonard Davis and Derrick Dockery - two= =20 guys I think have to take leadership roles on that line - allowed a DE to g= o=20 untouched right between them and stuff the running back for a 6-yard loss.= =20 =09 =09This kind of play should be a deep concern for UT coaches. Dockery has b= een=20 sick, and is still trying to regain weight lost while out with an infected= =20 cyst. Davis has struggled to get chemistry with Dockery's backup, Tillman= =20 Holloway. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says the line tends to play bett= er=20 in the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a while= =20 for them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing. That,= =20 however, may be too late against a good team.=20 =09 =09The old adage goes that you have to have a senior-laden offensive line t= o=20 have any real chance at a national title or Top 10 success. So far, that=20 appears to be true. Texas' O-line has just two seniors (Leonard Davis, Cory= =20 Quye), two juniors (Antwan Kirk-Hughes, Matt Anderson) and a sophomore=20 (Derrick Dockery). =20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: How frustrated is Chris Simms with his lack of playing time? In the= =20 off-season I kept hearing about how most of the players were really impress= ed=20 with the passing abilities of Simms. Are any of the players now questioning= =20 why Chris is not playing more than he is?=20 =09?? Jeff Weaver, Dallas=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Simms said this week that the rotation is difficult. But player= s=20 have not chosen sides. Simms says there are times when he makes a mistake a= nd=20 would love to go back in and correct it, even though his rotation is up and= =20 Major Applewhite is coming in. The questions for both guys are constant.=20 =09 =09Simms also said there are times when he knows it's his last series befor= e=20 Applewhite comes in, and it's third-and-17 and he's tempted to throw a deep= =20 pass to try to make something happen and stay in the game. Against Houston,= =20 he had a situation like that and opted to throw a 6-yard route to B.J.=20 Johnson, the safer choice. ""It was the smarter thing to do,"" he said.=20 =09 =09My theory was that the coaches would try to get Simms as much playing ti= me as=20 possible in the first four games to show what he can do. And then, come=20 Oklahoma, the coaches settle on one QB. After the OSU game, I think the=20 coaches need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to the=20 hot-hand policy Brown said he would employ this season. The question is, wi= ll=20 Simms get enough snaps to show he deserves to be that guy? Right now, coach= es=20 have tended to lean on Applewhite whenever it's crunch time.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09[IMAGE]=20 =09Major Applewhite =20 =09 =09Q: Major Applewhite has become the red-headed straight-A student who is= =20 having to contend with the jock favored son. Mack Brown has to appease alum= s=20 and parents (Simms') who want to see Phil Simms' son as UT's QB. I think wh= at=20 is being done is a ... (I have to say  it) ... a Major Injustice.=20 =09 ?? A ""Major"" Longhorn fan from Dallas=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I think there is a misconception out there that Phil Simms is= =20 constantly calling Mack Brown, demanding that he give Chris more playing=20 time. Or that Mack Brown made some deal with the Simms family, assuring=20 everyone that Chris would get playing time. None of that is true.=20 =09 =09According to Chris, the only assurance he received is that he would be= =20 allowed to =20 =09 =09compete  for the starting job. So far, that's what's happened. Now, whet= her=20 Chris continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that he=20 deserves to get substantial minutes remains to be seen.=20 =09 =09It's hard to argue with Applewhite's results so far this season. Here's = a=20 breakdown of their stats: Applewhite is 49 of 87 passing (56.3 percent=20 completion rate) for 729 yards with 6 TDs and 3 interceptions. He has a QB= =20 rating of 142.57. Simms has completed 19 of 36 passes (52.8 percent) for 25= 7=20 yards with three TDs and three interceptions. His QB rating is 123.58. But= =20 Brown is not trying to appease Simms as much as he is trying to see what=20 Simms can do.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Is the quarterback rotation hurting the UT offense?=20 =09?? Sara McFadden=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I asked Major Applewhite if he was playing up to his ability th= is=20 season. He said no. I asked him if Chris Simms was playing as well as he=20 could. Applewhite said no. If one or the other was given the QB job until h= e=20 lost the hot hand, you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to this=20 offense. But it's almost impossible to know.=20 =09 =09The players say it doesn't matter who is playing QB, they're both solid.=  It=20 is hard to argue that Major shouldn't be the man. All he's done is win and= =20 break records. Simms is still adjusting to college ball and not being ""the= =20 man"" for the first time in his competitive life. Every time he has walked= =20 onto a football field, he's been Phil Simms' kid and the top choice to play= =20 QB. Now, he's battling with a guy who has Major results.=20 =09 =09I thought that the rotation was hurting the offense. But offensive=20 coordinator Greg Davis justifiably pointed out to me that UT has passed for= =20 more yards through three games this year than it did last year. So I decide= d=20 to break everything down in the passing game, comparing UT's offense throug= h=20 three games this year to the first three games of 1999. While Texas has mor= e=20 passing yards (986 in 2000 to 940 in 1999) and more TD passes (9 in 2000 to=  7=20 in 1999), the combined completion percentage of both QBs is down (55.3 in= =20 2000 to 61.6 in 1999). UT also has more interceptions this year (6 in 2000 = to=20 1 in 1999). And one of those picks was returned for a touchdown.=20 =09 =09I tend to think Applewhite's numbers would be much better if he were all= owed=20 to start and stay in. Of course, Simms would have better numbers, too, if h= e=20 got to play most of the game. But by sharing, I think both of their=20 production is down. Maybe it's just a matter of getting used to this=20 rotation. We'll see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude about=20 this. Davis said Tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks a= ll=20 season long. =20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: What is the source of greater confusion for the O-line: opposing=20 defenses' tactics or Texas' own offensive scheme?  In other words, is the= =20 offense too complex so that they don't know their assignments  or are they= =20 simply being outplayed? =20 =09 ?? Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  The offensive linemen, quarterbacks and coaches all say that th= ey=20 have seen a slew of junk defenses through the first three games. Coach Mack= =20 Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston did not use defensive= =20 schemes that they had shown in previous games.=20 =09 =09Brown's contention is that other teams can make their season by beating = UT,=20 so they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the Longhorns. Against= =20 Stanford, UT wasn't good enough to make the Cardinal pay. So, according to = UT=20 personnel, the defenses have been new. Now that it's the fourth game of the= =20 season, one would think there are only so many defenses the O-line hasn't= =20 seen. The excuses are running out.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09[IMAGE]=20 =09Ricky Brown =20 =09 =09Q: It appears to me that Texas really misses the blocking of Ricky Brown= ,=20 both in the running game and in the blitz pick-up. Who is Texas recruiting = to=20 replace him? I don't question Matt Trissel's effort, but he just doesn't se= em=20 to be getting it done for Texas. =20 =09?? Bart Jacobs=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  The coaches are recruiting a fullback named James Buchanan of= =20 Sarasota, Fla., Cardinal Mooney, who is also being pursued by Florida State= =20 and Florida. But they are happy with Matt Trissel. They say he's young and= =20 needs a little more time to get adjusted to the fullback position after=20 excelling at linebacker in high school. Mack Brown considers Trissel a lead= er=20 on the offense despite his status as a redshirt freshman. He's had some=20 botched blocking assignments, but so have all the other backs.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Despite a visit from the nutritionist during the off-season, and a m= uch=20 publicized weight loss, the offensive line still appears overweight and slo= w.=20 What is Jeff Madden doing the rectify this problem? If this problem=20 persists, =20 =09 =09might Texas be looking to hire a new strength coach? I know Madden is a = good=20 friend of Mack Brown's, but production has to be the bottom line, and right= =20 now, it appears Madden isn't getting it done. I enjoy your newsletter. Than= k=20 you for your time.=20 =09?? James Taglienti=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Madden is someone I consider UT's secret weapon. He's much more=  than=20 a coach for this team. He works their bodies and minds and can be credited= =20 with getting this team to believe that it could beat Nebraska back in 1998.= =20 The players love and respect him even though he works them to the ground.= =20 None of the breakdowns so far this season can be attributed to Madden.=20 Physically, the players are in good shape. Their problems are mental. Madde= n=20 is one of the most valued members of the staff. ? =09 =09 Q: Are there any hopes for a national championship considering the loss=  to =20 Stanford?=20 =09?? Liddy Newsome=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Anything is possible. Texas would need Nebraska to remain=20 undefeated, and then hope the other top 10 teams pick up a loss or two. If= =20 Texas could go unbeaten the rest of the way and beat an undefeated and No. = 1=20 Nebraska in the Big 12 title game, the Longhorns could possibly get lucky a= nd=20 end up in the Orange Bowl. But that is about as long a shot as Ricky Willia= ms=20 suiting up for UT this Saturday.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: I have heard a lot about how much talent Chance Mock has. How does h= is =20 talent compare to that of Chris Simms? If he wouldn't have redshirted, coul= d=20 he have beat out Chris or possibly Major Applewhite as the main guy?=20 =09?? Brett Holmes=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Not a chance. No pun intended. Mock asked to redshirt because h= e has=20 much to learn and wants to step in after Simms and Applewhite move on.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: I think Hodges Mitchell is a good kid, with a good pedigree ... and= =20 there's the rub. Is Coach Brown too in love with this kid? Is he doing an o= ld=20 friend a favor by keeping this kid in the game? He had a decent season last= =20 year, especially coming out of the shadow of Ricky Williams, but I have see= n=20 nothing this year that suggests anything close to that this season.=20 =09 =09I cannot blame the O-line and here is why: For a prototypical ""scat-back= ,""=20 Hodges seems to run to traffic. There were several plays last week where a= =20 quick step one way or the other would have gotten him to more open field.= =20 Instead he would run right into the defense. Does he just not have the=20 ""vision"" required of a good running back? I cannot believe that he is that= =20 much better than the other running backs on the roster. Are the rest that= =20 bad? There has to be more to the story.=20 =09?? Roy Cassas=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Mitchell apparently needs to be pushed to the brink of losing h= is=20 job to really find traction. Last year, he was on the verge of losing his j= ob=20 to Victor Ike when he started to really cut loose on the way to 1,300 yards= =20 rushing and 300 yards receiving. He says he is ready to cut loose, again (i= n=20 the fourth game, just like last year).  The problem is, Texas is playing=20 Oklahoma State this week, who has the nation's No. 1 defense against the ru= n.=20 Last year, Mitchell broke a couple draws on Oklahoma State and ran for 149= =20 yards. We'll see if he can shake the slump he's in. Otherwise, look for Ike= =20 and Kenny Hayter to start getting more of the load.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: In your most recent ""Inside UT Football"" you mentioned that stations=  on=20 the UT football network are listed on the texassports.com Web site. I have= =20 another suggestion for people such as me who live in other parts of the=20 country, or overseas. I have found that all (I think) NCAA top 25 broadcast= s=20 are carried on http://sports.yahoo.com/. They carry all NFL radio broadcast= s=20 as well. One of the beauties about this site is that if you don't like one= =20 set of announcers you can usually switch over to those who carry the opposi= ng=20 team. As my grandson would say, ""And that's really cool."" I enjoy your week= ly=20 newsletter very much. Keep it up. =20 =09?? Bud Sloan, Reno, Nev.=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Thanks for sharing, Bud. Hope this helps some other folks.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Why does Coach Mack Brown reject criticism with cynicism, yet accept= =20 praise with zeal? To illustrate my point, Coach Brown became terse while=20 citing fans as ""... being negative and openly critical ..."" (i.e., four=20 losses in five games, 100 net yards rushing in five games, a probable QB=20 controversy and lest we not forget, yet another blocked punt). Conversely,= =20 Coach Brown will devour praise with carnivorous delight! Coach Brown cites= =20 the team's emotional psyche as ""... being fragile,"" yet Coach Brown fueled= =20 this euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the season.= =20 =09 =09Is it not the coach's responsibility to provide stability to the team's= =20 mental and emotional state? Is Coach Brown's tenure paralleling the turbule= nt=20 and volatile path taken by rival coach Jackie Sherrill at Texas A=02?(no eg= os in=20 that one!) during the 1980s? =20 =09?? David Newburn=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Mack Brown says all of his responses to criticism are simply to=  help=20 his players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped. Brown is very=20 sensitive to criticism. If someone criticizes the running game, he reminds= =20 them that the passing game is rated No. 4 nationally. When someone question= s=20 the quarterback rotation, he tells people to be positive instead of negativ= e=20 and contends that the players are fine with it - only the media is not.  I= =20 honestly think that Brown tries to see everything in such a positive light= =20 that he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking. He= =20 forgets that people are deeply, deeply passionate about their team. That=20 people get mad, really mad, when their team loses a game it shouldn't. Or= =20 worse, when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldn't (see= =20 Stanford).=20 =09 =09I think Brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in public= =20 appearances and with the media and has done so much to restore the traditio= n=20 to UT, that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of his= =20 team.

Why do= es=20 Hodges Mitchell continue to return punts?=20 =09 =09He is too much of a dance-around, east-west runner to be successful in t= he=20 kicking game. I realize he averaged close to 10-yds a return Saturday, but= =20 his average was more a product of Houston's poor field position. We need a= =20 gamebreaker returning kicks. If you trust the freshmen to play significant= =20 minutes, why not trust them with the return game?=20 =09 =09Secondly, why do we pull Casey Hampton on third-down passing situations?= =20 Hampton is a load and usually gets double-teamed. Why would you pull your= =20 All-American in a situation like that? In their nickel defense, shouldn't= =20 they push Shaun Rogers outside and leave Hampton in the middle?=20 =09?? Jeff Wilson=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Brown trusts Mitchell not to get tight and muff a punt return i= n=20 front of 80,000 people. That's not the greatest criteria, in my opinion. I= =20 would like to see Nathan Vasher back there personally, just to see what he= =20 can do. Vasher has been fearless in everything I've seen him do. Mitchell= =20 hasn't shown breakaway moves yet. If we don't see it soon, it might be time= =20 to give someone else a shot.=20 =09 =09They take Hampton out on nickel situations because they think that Shaun= =20 Rogers is the better pass rusher from the tackle position. There has been n= o=20 talk about moving Rogers to end in pass-rush situations. =20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Coach Mack Brown appeared to be auditioning for the head coach job a= t the=20 University of Oklahoma in the last minutes of the Houston game. Apparently= =20 unsatisfied with a 40-0 lead and two minutes to go, the Horns unloaded a lo= ng=20 pass from the arm of Chris Simms who hadn't been able to do anything all=20 night.

As is written below, 84% of all donations to  JDF go directly to diabetes research.  Wouldn't you feel good about giving to  such an efficient organization and honorable cause?  I'm sure you all need a  tax write-off too, right? :)  You can use a copy of your canceled check for  tax purposes.    Also, if you donate $25 or more, you will get an Enron JDF T-shirt.  Of  course, donations of any amount will be greatly appreciated.  Feel free to  forward this message to others who might be interested in donating, as well.  I will be making the rounds next week to get a head start on collecting, so  please email me if you'd like to contribute and bring a check made payable to  Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.  Thanks in advance for your participation! Allison ---------------------- Forwarded by Allison Easton/HOU/EES on 09/13/2000  03:46 PM ---------------------------  Mike McConnell@ENRON 09/08/2000 09:59 PM   Sent by: Enron Announcements@ENRON To: All Enron Houston cc:   Subject: Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Fundraising  It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's  Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday,  November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the  board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for  this year's fundraising efforts.  As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.   Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the  multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot  imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking  insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of  complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it  they would die.  Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF  is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money  raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise  $225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5  years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team  leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the  walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us  for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron  people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.  If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if  you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee  members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please  contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included  in the first important and informative training session taking place this  week.  Thank you very much for your support.

That is the biggest load of  garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the  math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to  the rest of the country.

What's the chance of this happening in the near term? =20 =09 ?? Waxer, Dallas=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Well, former UT regent Tom Hicks (owner of the Dallas Stars and= =20 Texas Rangers) wants it done and is willing to help pay for it, so there is=  a=20 good chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years. UT=20 would start by expanding and closing in the north end of Royal-Memorial. Th= en=20 the focus would turn to the south end.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09[IMAGE]=20 =09Kalen Thornton =20 =09 =09Q: What happened to Adam Doiron?=20 =09?? Morris W. Collie, Houston=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Adam Doiron was initially projected by UT defensive coordinator=  Carl=20 Reese to be the top defensive end of the freshman class. He thought Doiron= =20 would be the best run stopper of the bunch, and since that's an area Texas= =20 wants to improve, Reese figured Doiron might play early on. But DE Kalen=20 Thornton moved ahead of Doiron during the pre-season, and now Reese is=20 considering redshirting Doiron. Doiron recently started working at defensiv= e=20 tackle, and if any more players go down at that position, Doiron could see= =20 playing time. The coaches like him, but might want to build for the future = by=20 holding him out this season.=20 =09 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: I was very happy to see some positive things from our offense in the=  =20 second half, especially the running of Kenny Hayter, but I have a  question= =20 about the punt team.=20 =09 =09It's obvious that opposing teams'  philosophy is to not call ""fair catch= ."" I=20 first noticed this against  Nebraska last year. And I certainly think that= =20 making an early tackle by  invading the ""halo"" and receiving a 5-yard penal= ty=20 is much better than  sitting back and possibly allowing a big return. =09 =09But if we're going to  get the penalty, why not lay our ears back and po= p the=20 receiver in the  mouth whether he's caught the ball or not? A big hit would= =20 make that  penalty a little easier to swallow, don't you think?=20 =09?? Cody Anderson, Houston, Texas=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  No question about it. First, you want to try to avoid getting t= he=20 penalty. But if you are going to get the penalty, then get your money's wor= th=20 and give that returner something to remember for next time.=20 =09 =09I hate this rule. Colorado coach Gary Barnett went so far as to say that= =20 against a team with great returners, such as Kansas State, who has David=20 Allen, it's better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys, take the= =20 5-yard penalty and keep them from breaking one 60 or 70 yards for a score.= =20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: It seems like I've been waiting forever for the offensive line to cl= ick.=20 Did something come together finally or have I not been paying attention? (I= =20 am out of state and am limited to TV and had to miss one game.)=20 =09?? Jerry Secrets=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  No, things did click in the second half of the Oklahoma State g= ame.=20 The running game used a gap-blocking scheme that focuses more on blocking= =20 angles than individual players. On running plays, the guard opposite the pl= ay=20 side was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks. Mack Brown said the= =20 team had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didn't work. But last= =20 Saturday, it did.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Will Sean Rogers play on Saturday?=20 =09?? Rick Bush, Dallas=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I think it's doubtful. Rogers didn't practice Tuesday and was s= till=20 seen with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle. But I'm sure h= e=20 and the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time. Those hi= gh=20 ankle sprains can be a nightmare if they don't heal properly, however. No o= ne=20 wants to rush him back and then lose him for the season because his return= =20 was premature.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09[IMAGE]=20 =09Josh Heupel =20 =09 =09Q: OU has a great passing attack. Do you feel that Texas' young secondar= y can=20 answer the call? =20 =09 ?? Marty Wagner=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  This is the battle of the game, in my opinion: OU's receivers v= s.=20 UT's secondary. If OU quarterback Josh Heupel goes unpressured, the UT=20 secondary might need therapy after this game. But Rod =20 =09 =09Babers and Quentin Jammer have made progress each game. If Lee Jackson i= s=20 back, he'll play strong safety, and Greg Brown would move from SS back to= =20 free safety. That means Dakarai Pearson goes back to the nickel back, which= =20 in this game, is good news for UT. You need Pearson in the game as much as= =20 possible. In my opinion, he breaks on the ball better than most of UT's=20 D-backs.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: How do you see the Texas-Oklahoma game shaping up? What will be the = keys?=20 =09?? Sara Wilson=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I think the offenses are equal, so it will come down to who pla= ys=20 the best defense. I think Texas has the better defense, even without Shaun= =20 Rogers. So I see Texas winning, 24-20. Turnovers will change the complexion= =20 of the game, of course. But I think UT is catching OU at the right time aft= er=20 picking up some much-needed confidence on offense against Oklahoma State.= =20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Now that the quarterback experiment SHOULD be officially over at Tex= as,=20 do you expect Major Applewhite to start and play the entire game against OU= ?=20 Also (looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue= ),=20 do you think Major Applewhite would be a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidat= e=20 IF he were to start every game and take 90 percent of the snaps?=20 =09 =09My two cents ... I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major= =20 Applewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which = he=20 obviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba= ck=20 at the University of Texas, which he might be. (I say might because I haven= 't=20 seen Chance Mock play in a game. He might be better than Simms.)=20 =09 ?? Clint Mickey=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Major Applewhite will start against Oklahoma (based on repetiti= ons=20 with the first team in practice this week) and I would be shocked if he=20 doesn't play most or all of this game. In fact, I think Major will play mos= t=20 or all of the next two games.=20 =09 =09If UT beats OU, the Colorado game will be one of those nightmare games= =20 because UT will be fighting a letdown and the Buffaloes will probably still= =20 be winless (the Bufs play at A=02?this week).  So, these next two games are=  all=20 about experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on= =20 Missouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20 having two starting quarterbacks.=20 =09 =09I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he=  had=20 been the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes= t=20 player in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t= he=20 best QB on your own team.=20 =09 =09As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20 continue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much this=20 season. We'll see. Mock is still two years away unless Applewhite or Simms= =20 gets injured.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09[IMAGE]=20 =09Major Applewhite =20 =09 =09Q: It's become obvious to everyone outside MackWorld that Major Applewhi= te=20 has established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at Texas. = It=20 has become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks ""starters"" and insist on=20 token starts for Chris Simms.=20 =09 =09It seems to me it would be less demeaning to Simms to name Applewhite as=  THE=20 starter and bring Simms in for quality playing time during the game instead= =20 of allowing him two series, then yanking him in favor of the REAL starter w= ho=20 then plays the rest of the game. The current charade hasn't fooled anyone. = As=20 fine as Simms' =20 =09 =09talent appears to be, this is Major's team.  Any comments? =20 =09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I talked to Major one-on-one on Monday, and he said he didn't= =20 realize how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the infusi= on=20 of confidence by leading Texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon= d=20 half against Oklahoma State. If the coaches are insistent about this=20 rotation, it will be interesting to see if Applewhite can continue to=20 maintain or build on the confidence he seized in the OSU game. =20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: What is happening with special teams? I know they have had some rece= nt=20 success after missed tackles and have improved, but what I cannot understan= d=20 is why the opposing team can get so close to Kris Stockton and UT, with=20 superior recruiting and athletes, can not even get close. This has really= =20 hurt us. How is our blocking so different? Why does this problem persist? = =20 =09?? Chad Dieterichs=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  It sure appears to me that the players on the line are giving w= ay=20 too much ground after the snap. Almost every punt this season has been a=20 matter of, can Stockton get the punt off before the opposing team collapses= =20 onto Stockton's pocket?=20 =09 =09Mack Brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team. He says t= hat=20 they use the same formation that every NFL team uses and that special teams= =20 are prone to breakdowns because there aren't enough scholarships to recruit= =20 special teams players. And he says young players have to be used because=20 veterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20 =09 =09I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t= o=20 have a mental block, now that two punts have been blocked this season. He= =20 said he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w= as=20 the result of OSU players twisting and a UT player failing to pick up the= =20 assignment. At least this time, the punt blocker didn't run untouched throu= gh=20 the middle of the line.=20 =09? =09 =09 Q: I think people get too caught up in what's happening right now to re= alize=20 what this team will be in a year or two. All we've heard about is how=20 wonderful Mack's recruiting has been and how loaded we are, yet how the=20 O-line is less than impressive and how the QB situation is hurting us.=20 =09 =09Guess what? Most of these ""great"" players are only 18. Remember Ricky as=  a=20 freshman? Didn't think so. Think about how solid we will be in two years wi= th=20 current players and the new recruits coming in. So if we lose another game = or=20 two this season and end up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl, no= =20 biggie.=20 =09 =09In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w= ill=20 it take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college= =20 programs? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and= =20 we're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20 direction, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a= =20 true Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20 =09?? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin= t.=20 The talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line= s=20 has to have experience, and there have to be some ""Braveheart""-type leaders= =20 on the team.=20 =09 =09Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two= =20 seniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.= =20 So the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a= =20 couple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national= =20 championship.=20 =09 =09But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in= stead=20 of just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the= =20 Longhorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex= as=20 will be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20 =09 =09Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20 included) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20 State. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20 recruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In= =20 the next couple years, Texas will justifiably be held to the same standard = as=20 the perennial powers.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: : I have two questions for you Chip: A) Does The University still ha= ve=20 the longest scoring streak in NCAA football? B) If I find myself looking at= =20 NEXT year's schedule after a payback loss at Stanford, do I need profession= al=20 help? (P.S. You may also want to remind your readers we should NEVER feel= =20 guilty about running up the score against U of H.)=20 =09?? Arland Bishop=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Texas has scored in a Big 12-record 231 straight games, dating = back=20 to a 16-0 loss at Baylor in 1980. That is the second-longest active streak = in=20 the nation. BYU holds the longest scoring streak: 318 games.=20 =09 =09Next year's schedule is even more appetizing than this year's schedule. = The=20 only non-conference road game is at Houston. The non-conference home games= =20 are New Mexico State and North Carolina. And the Big 12 schedule has Colora= do=20 in Austin. UT will have Oklahoma in Dallas (as usual) and Texas A=02?at Kyl= e=20 Field.=20 =09 =09So, no, you don't need therapy. If anything, next year's schedule should=  be=20 another reason to have patience with this year's team. Good times are=20 obviously on the horizon.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: I know the subject has been worn into the ground, but I haven't hear= d=20 this view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling= =20 early in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course= ).=20 They were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20 barely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down= =20 and let him do his magic.=20 =09 =09It was like night and day.  Basically, what they did was abandon their m= ore=20 balanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear= ly=20 and often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.= =20 =09 =09I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the= m.=20 The only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig= ht=20 when Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove= =20 straight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (= at=20 least the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was= =20 probably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major= =20 in the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so= =20 far).=20 =09 =09I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU=  has=20 done it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20 Nebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20 one-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability=  -=20 his mobility. Personally, I don't care which QB is used this season - in th= e=20 shotgun or not, but I really wish Mack Brown would just choose one and stic= k=20 with him. =20 =09?? Aaron Ruhnow=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci= fic=20 situations. The Texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense= =20 that can run out of multiple sets. I do like the shotgun. The Buffalo Bills= =20 used it all the time while they were going to all those Super Bowls. You ca= n=20 do a lot with it. But it probably won't become a fixture in Austin.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Do you think that the pressure and expectations of Texas fans are go= ing=20 to be too much for Mack Brown to handle? It appears he is already crumbling= .=20 If he thinks people are hammering him now, what will it be like if he drops= =20 this year's game to A=02?and suffers four losses?=20 =09?? Mike McDonald=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  : I hope it won't be too much for Mack Brown. He's a good perso= n and=20 works really hard. I think he needs to just let some of this stuff wash ove= r=20 him and forget about it. I think he has gotten into a rut lately where he= =20 senses that every question has negative overtones. So now he is answering= =20 every question by acknowledging his critics with some kind of remark.=20 =09 =09He has done more for Texas than UT will ever know.

The kid= s,=20 for the most part, are good kids.=20 =09 =09There's no need for Mack to draw a line in the sand and allow a few nega= tive=20 voices to bring him down or cast a shadow over all the progress he has made= .=20 If he moves on, the media and the critics will move on, too. If he harps on= =20 criticism and keeps bringing it up in his answers, the media has no=20 alternative but to report it. It becomes a wicked circle.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: David Aaron was a receiver that came out of Marshall a few years bac= k. I=20 know he also went to UT for track but he was a great receiver in high schoo= l.=20 I saw him on the sidelines a few times but he never got much playing time. = I=20 was thinking he should be a senior this year.

He has left the football= =20 team.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Is it just me , or does the football field look a little bit torn up= ? It=20 just looks really dry and during the game a lot of turf gets thrown up.=20 =09?? Mark V.=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  UT officials say it's the drought and the fact that the UT team= =20 practices on the field on Thursdays. But, I agree. I think the field looks= =20 worse this season than it did last season (and we had a drought and the tea= m=20 practiced on it last year, too).=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: What is up with all the negative press that Mack Brown and the Horns=  have=20 been getting lately? From exercising their right to buy out of the Hawaii= =20 game to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score in= =20 the U of H game, and finally, to wanting the U of H game moved from a high= =20 school stadium to a real college stadium where real fans can see a football= =20 game. =09 =09I'm not sure about Dallas, but here in Houston Mack and Co. have been ge= tting=20 drilled for everything I listed above and more (QB rotation). It just seems= =20 like everyone in the media, and even some our own fans, want to find=20 something negative to heap on the program. =09 =09In my opinion, Mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this. Mack, = his=20 coaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and up-front wit= h=20 the media and the public. They have expressed confidence, but never boasted= =20 about their greatness. In fact, they have been the epitome of humility. Do= =20 you have any thoughts as to why this is occurring? Hook 'em. =20 =09?? Marty Murray, Class of '82, Baytown, Texas=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  It does seem to be a ridiculous truth that when we build someth= ing=20 up, we inevitably end up tearing it down. Maybe the sense is that the=20 storybook season of 1998 and the victory over Nebraska last year built up t= oo=20 big of expectations. The three losses at the end of last year did nothing t= o=20 burst the bubble and then when UT comes out flat this year, everyone=20 re-evaluated and said, ""Wait, they really aren't that good."" =09 =09Mack Brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations. But whe= n the=20 star falls, people want to be the first to say it's falling. Then, they wan= t=20 to add their own wrinkle as to why it's falling. So people look for cracks = in=20 the foundation to bring up.=20 =09 =09It's like in political campaigns. The media tends to build up a candidat= e and=20 then when the first negative story comes out, they re-evaluate, and if some= =20 bad trends continue, that candidate gets torn to shreds. It all feeds on=20 itself. But inevitably there is a settling period. =09 =09I think the people who are quick to say that Texas isn't as good as we= =20 believed will calm down and there will be another story to cover. Plus, Tex= as=20 may get hot, win all of its games, and then this brief bout of criticism wi= ll=20 have been for naught. But sometimes criticism can be good for a coach and h= is=20 team. He can use it as bulletin board material to get the team going. We'll= =20 see how Mack Brown and the vocal minority of critics handle things from=20 here. =20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Do you think Chris Simms would have benefited from a redshirt year? = I=20 realize we were thin at quarterback last year and it was probably not an=20 option, but I look back at Major Applewhite and it appears to me he benefit= ed=20 from a redshirt year in which his only responsibility was to learn the=20 system. When he came in as a redshirt freshman, he was ready to go. Thanks= =20 for your insightful newsletter. =20 =09?? Michael R. Johnson, Houston, Texas =20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Sure, I think most players benefit from a redshirt year unless = they=20 are Michael Vick. There was no way a redshirt season was going to happen fo= r=20 Simms, however. Simms wants to spend just four years in college, and UT=20 coaches needed a backup for Applewhite. There is no question Applewhite=20 benefited from his redshirt season.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: I'm really sick of all this negative stuff from a vocal minority of= =20 fair-weather fans. They sound like a bunch of whining Aggies.=20 =09 =09Having said that, I still can't help but wonder if we don't have a probl= em=20 with our offensive line coach. According to the UT media guide, Coach Tim= =20 Nunez has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior to=20 coming here. He didn't play that position either. There is no track record = of=20 having actually developed a line, since he inherited experienced lines at= =20 both Marshall and UT.=20 =09 =09This group clearly hasn't improved, even though it was a major source of= =20 concern after last season. Nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter,= =20 but does anyone think that he is one of the top O-line coaches in the=20 country? Is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li= ne=20 recruits we have committed for next year?=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Patience. Don't fire a coach before it gets to mid-season. If t= he=20 offensive line doesn't show any progress by the end of the year, then it's= =20 time to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs. Nunez was coaching= =20 this line when it beat Nebraska last year, so let's give him some time to= =20 work with these guys.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: What's the scoop on playing UH at Robertson Stadium next year? Can T= exas=20 (a la Hawaii) threaten to cancel the game with Houston unless it is played = in=20 the Astrodome or Rice Stadium? Also, how can either school afford to give u= p=20 the lost revenue that would result from a Robertson Stadium game, even if= =20 they do put in an extra 10,000 temporary seats?=20 =09?? Chris Barbee, El Campo, Texas =20 =09 =09 BROWN:  This is a price Texas will pay for trying to rekindle some semb= lance=20 of an old Southwest Conference matchup. After UT canceled the Hawaii game, = I=20 doubt they will actively seek to change next year's schedule. It will be an= =20 intimate setting, shall we say.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: I live in Odessa and I use to see Roy Williams do punt returns. Why = not=20 let  him return some punts?=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  Mack Brown doesn't like to put freshmen back on punt returns un= til=20 at least mid-season. After mid-season, he argues that freshmen aren't=20 freshmen anymore. So, perhaps after mid-season, if UT is not making any=20 progress on punt returns, we'll see some new faces back there. I would love= =20 to see what Williams can do, although I doubt that coaches would put him ba= ck=20 there. And I would really like to see Nathan Vasher back there. Heck, I wou= ld=20 like to see Nathan Vasher everywhere. From what I have seen, the kid is=20 fearless with tons of confidence. We'll see.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 Q: Before the UT/Oklahoma State game, I thought that Mack Brown would s= tart=20 shuffling the quarterbacks less often - giving them a quarter or two instea= d=20 of two or three series each - in order to begin to establish some sort of= =20 consistency. (In your Sept. 25 column, you also said this should happen.) I= n=20 the game, Chris Simms started, but was pulled early after an interception,= =20 and Applewhite played until well into the fourth quarter. The TV announcers= =20 even wondered aloud if Simms was hurt in some way, since he didn't get back=  =20 in until late in the game.=20 =09 =09My question is: Was this a message to Simms in some way, due to his poor= =20 early performance? Or was this somewhat scripted in advance in order to giv= e=20 Applewhite the reigns? It certainly appears that the coaches have more=20 confidence in Applewhite based on the situations they put him in. =20 =09?? Rick Highfill. Naperville, Ill.=20 =09 =09 BROWN:  I sincerely think that the coaches have been trying to give Sim= ms=20 every chance to thrive and possibly win the job. After four games, it's cle= ar=20 he hasn't won the job outright. Now, coaches have to decide if this rotatio= n=20 is really the best thing for the team and its leadership. I think they will= =20 rely more on Applewhite in the next two games and thus kind of disprove the= ir=20 own theories about having two starters.=20 =09 =09The hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once = you=20 say you have two starters, it's a real blow to one once you say that you no= w=20 only have one starter.

Marge Ringer=20 =09 =09BROWN: Major Applewhite was named the starter for the Colorado game on= =20 Tuesday by coach Mack Brown. Brown said Chris Simms would only be used on a= =20 ""need-to-win"" basis, meaning that for the first time this season, there is = no=20 plan to play both QBs this week. The coaches are hoping that by turning the= =20 offense over to Applewhite exclusively, there will be a spark. UT offensive= =20 coordinator Greg Davis said, however, that Texas could go back to the QB=20 rotation after this week. The coaches will wait and see. As far as other=20 promotions, B.J. Johnson will start at flanker ahead of Brandon Healy and R= oy=20 Williams will start at split end ahead of Montrell Flowers. The coaches mad= e=20 these promotions, in part, to help encourage Williams and Johnson to take= =20 more of a vocal leadership role. And coaches said freshman tight end Brock= =20 Edwards might see more playing time, and running back Kenny Hayter will see= =20 more carries than the two he had against OU last week.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09[IMAGE] =09Kenny Hayter=20 =09 =09Q:I'm having trouble understanding why the Longhorns will not put in a b= igger=20 running back during first and second down to increase their chances at a=20 third-and-short situation. I believe Hodges Mitchell is more of a third-dow= n=20 back who is better suited for throwing to out of the backfield than he is a= =20 guy who can pound the ball straight ahead and pick up four to six yards on= =20 first and second down. Watching the game last week and previous games as=20 well, I've noticed too many times that Texas has put itself in third and=20 long  situations due to not =09 =09picking up anything on the first two downs. Kenny Hayter, in my opinion,=  is a=20 more physical back who doesn't go down as easy. They should put him in ther= e=20 on first and second down to pick up some positive yardage, and bring in=20 Hodges to run draw plays and block on third down since he has good hands an= d=20 is a reliable blocker. =20 =09?? Eric Barker, Plano, Texas=20 =09 =09BROWN: Texas got behind so early against Oklahoma that the running game= =20 became a moot point. Mack Brown said he should have run the ball more in th= e=20 second half to grind out the clock and keep the score closer. But he said h= e=20 was foolish enough to think his team could come back, so UT tried to throw= =20 and score quickly. Hayter took most of the first-team snaps in practice thi= s=20 week, so look for him to get more of a chance against Colorado.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:What recruits were on the sideline for the OU game? =20 =09?? Lance Kyles=20 =09 =09BROWN: None. Texas was the visiting team. Only the home team is allowed = to=20 bring recruits to UT-OU game. So UT will be allowed to bring recruits to ne= xt=20 year's OU game.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:Why did Kenny Hayter get only two carries? Why didn't our defense get= =20 pressure on Josh Heupel? Why do we run so many 5-yard patterns on offense?= =20 Give us the answers, Chip. What are the coaches' comments on these  topics?= =20 =09?? Cody Anderson, Houston=20 =09 =09BROWN: I think I've pretty much answered the Hayter question. The runnin= g=20 game became somewhat irrelevant in the OU game pretty quickly because UT wa= s=20 forced to pass to try to get back in it. But Hodges Mitchell did get a lot = of=20 time, mostly because he ran for 204 yards in last year's OU game and becaus= e=20 he is the bigger receiving threat. Look for Hayter to get more carries this= =20 week. It's hard to believe that Shaun Rogers makes that big of a difference= ,=20 but Casey Hampton said UT would have gotten more pressure on Heupel if Roge= rs=20 was in there. Rogers is expected to play this week. The 5-yard patterns,=20 according to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, are the routes that the=20 defense is giving Texas. The coaches want the receivers to become more like= =20 running backs after the catch and use their speed and moves to break for bi= g=20 yards.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:I began following Longhorn football when I arrived at UT in  1995, and=  no=20 one was more shocked than me when the alumni and DeLoss Dodds  turned on Jo= hn=20 Mackovic so viciously after the loss to UCLA in 1997. Not only was I appall= ed=20 at the time, but I was even more horrified to learn that  this was par for= =20 the course for UT football coaches. Mack Brown seems to have been truly=20 embraced by the community over the last two years, but I'm  worried we are= =20 about to see a repeat of history. What do you think?=20 =09?? Lisa Davis, Austin=20 =09 =09BROWN: I was surprised at the venom being spit this week in and around= =20 Austin. People were talking about hiring John Mackovic as offensive=20 coordinator or bringing in Spike Dykes to talk to UT about how to respond= =20 after being blown out. All of this is crazy. Now, I will grant you that thi= s=20 game with Colorado is do-or-die as far as the Big 12 title. If UT loses it,= =20 the Horns will pretty much need the rest of the Big 12 South to fall apart = in=20 order to get into the league title game. But if UT wins, the Horns are real= ly=20 in the driver's seat for the Big 12 South title. I say that because the=20 chances of OU winning two of three against No. 1 Nebraska, No. 2 Kansas Sta= te=20 and at Texas A=02?are slim. The chances are good the Sooners will emerge wi= th at=20 least two losses in those games. Texas can get right back in the race with = a=20 win Saturday. If the Longhorns do win and UT looks good with Major Applewhi= te=20 at QB, then everyone will say ""I told you so, Mack"" regarding the QB rotati= on=20 having slowed down UT's offense all season. But the critical fans will also= =20 embrace Mack and move on. If Texas loses, I think people will be upset, but= =20 they will also need to get behind Mack Brown and start building support for= =20 the rest of this season and next season. Mack Brown isn't going anywhere.= =20 He'll be around Texas for a good while.=20 =09> ? =09 =09 =09 =09 =09[IMAGE] =09Casey Hampton=20 =09 =09Q:I know I have no right to criticize coaching because I don't have any = idea =20 what I would do in their situation. Having said that, I now must say that = =20 after a while, one begins to wonder about the coaching. You've said  numero= us=20 times that the coaches shouldn't be blamed for the Longhorns'  inconsistenc= y,=20 and most of the time I agree with you. However, this pattern  UT seems to= =20 follow amazes me. Every few games, everything just blows up and  we are=20 embarrassed. How can a team with such obviously great talent manage  to scr= ew=20 up horribly in random=20 =09 =09games? My only thought is that it has to be  the coaching. It's not like=  the=20 players aren't good enough. Kenny Hayter  proves in the OSU game to be the= =20 solution to the running game's problem.  Why replace him the next weekend i= n=20 a much bigger game with the truly  hard-working, but honestly inefficient= =20 Hodges Mitchell? Why run the ball  over and over when it obviously doesn't= =20 work? Or it could work, if the  right players were in... These things baffl= e=20 me. Do you think the coaching  is one of the problems? What can be done to= =20 fix the inconsistencies that  are actually becoming consistent and developi= ng=20 a pattern of embarrassing  losses? Last year there was N.C. State, and then= =20 the last three awful  games. This year, it's  mediocre Stanford, and the go= od=20 but not THAT good  OU. Will it ever stop? Thanks, I enjoy your newsletter.= =20 =09?? David Rowe, Austin=20 =09 =09BROWN: I think the OU game was, to some degree, an aberration. Oklahoma = got=20 it going and kept punching Texas in the face, and UT never got a punch in t= o=20 slow the Sooners down. Josh Heupel looked like Joe Montana, and the avalanc= he=20 was on. The biggest problem for Texas right now is no leadership on offense= .=20 Giving the offensive reins to Major Applewhite this week is a great move, I= =20 believe. It could give the Longhorns confidence, if it's not too late and t= he=20 offensive psyche hasn't been beaten down too much. The offensive line has n= o=20 vocal, emotional leaders. Antwan Kirk-Hughes is developing into that guy. B= ut=20 none of the other guys are fiery, vocal guys. And Applewhite has been an=20 ineffective leader to this point because he has been so worried about wheth= er=20 he is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this QB rotation.=20 Coaches can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field. You= =20 can't make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader. That stuff is= =20 inherent in players. Either you have it or you don't. On defense, Casey=20 Hampton and Shaun Rogers are the heart and soul. On special teams Beau Trah= an=20 needs to take command. On offense, it's clearly Applewhite who will have to= =20 step up. Maybe the end of the QB rotation will help him do that.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:Is it obvious to just fans or everyone that the Texas coaches fail to = have=20 the team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new =20 wrinkle or two each week? The opposing team always seems to know what is=20 coming while Texas is always caught by surprise early on. On offense, the= =20 play-calling is extremely predictable and increasingly  uncreative. On=20 defense, the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against Texas and= =20 the defense never seems to have made an adjustment. The defense uses the sa= me=20 blitzes without mixing things up enough. Both coach Reese and coach Davis= =20 seem extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a mista= ke=20 or setback. Well, we have suffered both, so why not give the players some= =20 excitement and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on t= he=20 sideline after seeing something totally new? It seemed to work against OSU= =20 with a little different blocking scheme. Good job but do it every week,=20 especially against the tougher opponents. Do you see these problems and=20 tendencies also?=20 =09?? Todd Purl=20 =09 =09BROWN: In talking to Greg Davis on Tuesday, he said he is re-evaluating = his=20 play calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it. Texas h= as=20 done well in the shotgun, four-wide, one-minute offense. But Davis said jus= t=20 using that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced 50-50= =20 with the run and the pass. At some point, and maybe this week, if that line= =20 can't open any holes for the backs, it will be time to give up hopes of bei= ng=20 balanced and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up th= e=20 run. We'll see if things improve this week. There is no question that the= =20 coaches are rethinking EVERYTHING right now. Davis also said he has gotten= =20 after the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early drives= .=20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:I am a Longhorn fan who tries to be realistic. Win alot, lose some -- = be=20 realistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and= =20 losing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has= =20 said ""the other team just wanted it more"" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges=20 Mitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas a= nd=20 Nebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? = Or=20 is it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might = =20 for Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc. =20 =09?? Mike Engelman=20 =09 =09BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very tell= ing.=20 When Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 und= er=20 the new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams= =20 like Nebraska (1998 and 1999) and Texas A=02?(1998) and won. But now that T= exas=20 is the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though=20 Brown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure= =20 there, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with= =20 everything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiti= ng=20 star players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will b= e=20 expected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So h= e=20 has to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when th= e=20 Sooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have= =20 all come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT= =20 had to beat them - Texas A=02?(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (= had=20 been beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cott= on=20 Bowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT= =20 in 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hop= e=20 of fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over= =20 Texas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and ma= ke=20 his team more hungry. Again, some of that will have to come from leadership= =20 among players. Some of it will be Mack Brown reinventing himself or=20 constantly arousing the senses of his players in different ways.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09 =09[IMAGE] =09Greg Davis=20 =09 =09Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were=20 thoroughly outplayed in all phases of the game. Even more disappointing is= =20 the fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are= =20 offensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the=20 better defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last= =20 seven games (including this one) we have played against ""good"" defenses=20 (K-State, Nebraska twice, A&M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible= .=20 We have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank =09 =09 54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (112th in th= e=20 country in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 99th i= n=20 the country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly=20 conservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below averag= e=20 when facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much=20 credit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failur= e=20 to see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on= =20 this prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter wa= s=20 on Saturday!  Thanks,=20 =09?? Lane=20 =09 =09BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bi= t=20 more. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down= ,=20 and some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin=20 there. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being=20 yanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where=20 plays are being called. Without question, when a team is struggling, the=20 tendency is to simplify. Well, UT can't afford to simplify its offense=20 anymore.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:Why did the coaching staff remove, or go away from, the quick-strike, = no-=20 huddle offense that was used in the first game? The team seemed to come =20 alive when they began using that offense, along with the appearance of Majo= r =20 Applewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford= , =20 the team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense = =20 did not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then=  =20 when the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why= =20 not  use this more and keep the defense guessing? Unlike most coaches, I=20 believe  with this style of offense, the pass will set up the run, and we a= ll=20 would  love to see a consistent running game.=20 =09?? Brian Gannon=20 =09 =09BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: ""The= =20 one-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo becau= se=20 it's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against= =20 using it as a standard offense is that it goes against our overall philosop= hy=20 of being balanced, 50-50, with the run and the pass.""=20 =09? =09 =09Q:The OU game was an unmitigated disaster from start to finish with no= =20 redeeming features  whatsoever which sets the program back at least a year,= =20 if not more. So tell us something good, Chip ... PLEASE! =20 =09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20 =09 =09BROWN: Again, if Texas wins this week, the Longhorns are back in the dri= ver's=20 seat for the Big 12 South, in my opinion. I would be surprised if Texas=20 doesn't bounce back with its best effort of the season. If there is a clear= =20 hangover, and Texas loses, it will be time to take the bad with the good. F= or=20 every 1998 storybook season, there is a season where everything doesn't fal= l=20 into place as expected. But let's see what happens this week. The effects o= f=20 the OU game won't set the program back a year unless the Longhorns let it. = If=20 UT bounces back this week and wins, the Longhorns have a pretty good schedu= le=20 to get to the A=02?game with only one league loss. Let's see what happens.= =20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:You stated that every QB would benefit from a redshirt year unless the= y=20 were Michael Vick. Michael Vick redshirted at Virginia Tech and benefited= =20 greatly from it. It was even his idea. They made a pretty big deal about it= =20 last year.=20 =09?? Brad Livingston=20 =09 =09BROWN: I stand corrected. But even in my error, I proved my point. I sai= d all=20 freshmen benefit from a redshirt year, and Chris Simms probably would have,= =20 too. I should have stated that Vick is the perfect example. Thank you for= =20 setting the record straight.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:It seems as though Major Applewhite has a better connection with the= =20 receivers than Chris Simms does. Do you think this is legit or is it merely= =20 coincidence since Simms has been starting and the receivers are cold, but= =20 Applewhite comes into the heat of the game when everyone has started to run= =20 on all cylinders? Also, why is the coaching staff giving Simms every chance= =20 to win the starting position when it is obvious to fans, coaches, and=20 opponents that Applewhite is the leader and the one to watch out for? Surel= y=20 if Simms lives up to his pedigree as everyone hopes, he wouldn't have his= =20 feelings hurt if he lost the starting job to someone superior to him.=20 =09?? Brandon May=20 =09 =09BROWN: Simms said this week that if the coaches went solely with Applewh= ite,=20 he could live with it as long as it was best for the team. He said he has= =20 been pressing and that interceptions have become a regular negative in his= =20 play. He said the grade he would give himself this season would be terrible= .=20 But he says, in his heart, he believes he will show everyone the promise th= at=20 has been expected of him since leaving high school as the nation's top QB= =20 prospect.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:What role is Courtnee Garcia playing this year on the football team? I= s=20 Miguel McKay on the football team?=20 =09?? Poorun Patel, Lufkin=20 =09 =09BROWN: Courtnee Garcia fell way behind after pulling a hamstring in the= =20 pre-season. He hasn't been able to capture sizable playing time as yet. And= =20 he lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behin= d=20 Nathan Vasher as a backup in that role. So Garcia needs to try to convince= =20 the coaches in practice that he deserves some playing time and then make th= e=20 most of it. Otherwise, there may not be enough snaps at split end (Garcia's= =20 position) behind Roy Williams and Montrell Flowers. Miguel McKay is on the= =20 team and got playing time at defensive tackle against OU. =20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:Since all of the big programs are operating under the same recruiting= =20 restraints, I don't think its unreasonable to expect more out of the recrui= ts=20 that Texas has. UT has had as good of a haul of recruits over the last 3-4= =20 years as any program in the country. Using the logic that has been offered = up=20 by some UT followers, we should be patient and wait until next year or the= =20 next. At that point, we will be waiting for the inexperienced defensive=20 tackles to mature ... or some other aspect of the team. I don't know where= =20 the actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would= =20 guess that it has something to do with getting ""senior"" performance from=20 underclassmen. Whether that is a product of the recruiting or motivation, I= =20 don't know. What do you think?=20 =09?? Kevin P. McCarthy=20 =09 =09BROWN: I think it's fair to expect a lot from this team next year with t= he=20 schedule UT has. And once Texas shows that it can crack the top 10 without= =20 losing before the end of October, and if Mack Brown can keep getting star= =20 high school recruits, the Longhorns will be expected to be in the top 10 fr= om=20 then on. So starting next year, I think it's fair to put Texas in the top 1= 0=20 and expect them to stay there all season. The UT Towers freshmen receiving= =20 corps will have a year of experience. Leonard Davis will be gone from the= =20 O-line, but Robbie Doane should be a suitable replacement, and UT will have= =20 all its running backs back except for Hodges Mitchell. The defense will los= e=20 two first-round NFL draft picks (Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers), but Marcu= s=20 Tubbs and Stevie Lee should be suitable replacements. The senior leadership= =20 in other areas will have to make up for the loss of this year's key seniors= .=20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:The addition of Roy Williams has helped Major Applewhite open up the= =20 offense because he is a big-play receiver. As a supporter of the Garland=20 Owls, I got to witness B.J. Johnson in a big-game situation in last year's= =20 semi-final game. He was an awesome player last year until that semi-final= =20 game. Will he be as big of a threat as Roy Williams? =20 =09?? Tyrance ""Duke"" Barnett, Garland, Texas=20 =09 =09BROWN: I think both of these guys will be outstanding. And more importan= tly,=20 their leadership will be needed on this offense beginning Saturday. As Mack= =20 Brown says, freshmen are only freshmen until mid-season. Then they have to = be=20 and play like upperclassmen. But Williams and Johnson will both be=20 outstanding, in my opinion.=20 =09? =09 =09 =09Q:Mack Brown should be HEAVILY criticized for his poor handling of the Q= B=20 situation. Major Applewhite has never done anything but show he is one of t= he=20 most confident, proven leaders from the QB position in the nation. In my=20 opinion, not even his injury or the fact that Chris Simms got a lot of reps= =20 in the spring warranted even a thought of him having to share time. You can= =20 say what you want, and Brown would obviously talk around this, but we would= =20 not have lost the Stanford game if Applewhite had started and played the=20 entire game. Both QBs, and the offense as a whole, have not played up to th= e=20 level they're capable of playing because of the inconsistency at QB. A QB= =20 controversy creates doubt and a lack of confidence for everyone involved. T= he=20 coaches, media and fans have fallen in love with an unproven commodity, all= =20 the while shucking aside an individual who did everything possible to prove= =20 he should be the starter. Mack Brown's job is to be above that, and it's ti= me=20 for him to take the heat. The media and fans are touching on this, but I=20 think it's time to tell it like it is with his illogical, failed and unfair= =20 experiment.=20 =09?? Jason Stone=20 =09 =09BROWN: Amen, Jason.

However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the  forecsts,  this is probably an unrealistic goal.  I will get back to you by  the end of the week with an acceptable target.

Given the forecasts for normal to warm in  the Gulf area this winter - with particular emphasis on warmth in the Jan-Mar  period - I anticipate that bids will come back, initially, around 560 - and  that we might be able to sell a swap around 585.  As a frame of reference,  last year (2000) came in at 412.5 HDDs and 1999 came in at 429.5 HDDs.  What kind of number are you looking for  - do you want to leave an order with  me where you'd be willing to sell the swap?  If you're interested in buying an option, perhaps you'd like to put a bid out  on the following structure:  Hobby Jan-Mar $15,000/HDD $2,700,000 Limit 560 strike (1/2 standard deviation from the 10 year average)  I imagine you could get this option for approx. $750,000.  The same option  with a $2,000,000 limit would go for about $100,000 less.  Let me know your thoughts.

In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were  lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.

Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.   It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the  goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games,  none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton  Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will  probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were  lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.   Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2  team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the  way.    Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.   It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the  goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).     And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to  back out of that contract a few years back?  See you in the Shreveport.

There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around!  After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going  to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in  yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball  (College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year.   However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football  nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little  more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a  crazy ""REEEEEEEE-Verse"" play or maybe even a pass on first down.

Also the original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.  Here are the scorecards from the event:  Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili  JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick. JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. FRANK: Holy cow, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried                paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to put the                flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.  Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili  JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang. JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken                         seriously. FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am                supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people                who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to                walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on my face.  Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili  JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans. JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers. FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I                have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now.                Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the                 front part of my chest. I'm getting drunk.  Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic  JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing. JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or                         other mild foods, not much of a chili. FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to                taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills;                that 300 lb. witch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste                I'm eating.  Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover  JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding                        considerable kick. Very impressive. JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit                         the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted                and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant                seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain                damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly                on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked                me to stop screaming.  Rednecks!  Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety  JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice                         and peppers. JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.                         Superb. FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric                flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except big Sally.                I need to sooth my butt with a snow cone!  Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili  JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers. JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili                         peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried                        about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress                        as he is cursing uncontrollably. FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't                  feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds                 like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili which                 slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like stuff to                 match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what                 killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm                 not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through                 the 4 inch hole in my stomach.  Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili  JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold                        but spicy enough to declare its existence. JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor hot. Sorry                         to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out,                         fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself. Not sure if he's going                         to make it. Poor Yank.

"SIPPING VODKA A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."" So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:  1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp. 2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12. 3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10. 4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. 5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass. 6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C. 7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook. 8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him. 9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass. 10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T."" 11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said,""Take this and eat it for it is my body.""  He did not say, Eat me"" 12.  The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,"" 13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God. 14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.   The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money. Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain is not broken.

Skiers and riders staying at participating lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can choose a free lift ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free half-day of childcare for each night they stay. For more information call 888-288-7360.  And if you're looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at the annual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and Snowboard Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference Center. Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like Telluride!   SLICE OF LIFE Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was the case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the Caribbean. She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the snows began to fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran outside and began to dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter's absolute embarrassment!) However, the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built their first snowman ever. The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot nose.. An organic carrot, no less. Hey, this is Telluride. Only the best for our snowmen.   AND SO, E-RIDERS, That's all for this letter. Hope you're planning your trip to Telluride, where the snow is always whiter and the lines are always short. See you on the slopes!  Rosemerry   WHO'S WRITING THIS ANYWAY? Against her will, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer learned to ski in Telluride six years ago. But after a few turns, she fell ? in love with the sport. She lives with her husband and cat at the base of Lift 7?an ideal spot for getting first chair of the morning.

ElectionIntegrity2000.com has already been mentioned on CSPAN and in the San Francisco Chronicle, but what we really want is to turn the heads of the major networks -- and that's going to take numbers.  Right now the mainstream media is claiming that the will of the people favors Al Gore.  We can turn the tide -- especially if we have several hundred thousand Americans behind us.  So don't give up!  Keep forwarding our messages, or tell your friends directly to visit http://www.electionintegrity2000.com  ""Hand counting"" of ballots is still going on in several counties in Florida.  Make no mistake, this fight is far from over.  That's why we are going to keep collecting petitions until George W. Bush is officially certified as President-elect and until Al Gore concedes.  Remember, with every day that passes without a certified Bush victory, Al Gore's chances of stealing this election increase.

Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. ""The end zones were confusing,"" says Slocum. ""I'm sure that some of the touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.  We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount.""  Oklahoma officials are calling this ""outrageous"". ""They agreed to the size, shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,"" replies OU coach Bob Stoops.  ""If they had a problem with them, they should have said so before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with the outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points many times.""  A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well  as that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  ""We are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of the game,"" says Slocum.  OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones were used. ""They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,"" says Stoops.  Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing signs such as, ""A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!"" Students' thoughts echoed their signs. ""All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a winner,"" says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.  ""We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner.""  ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner, despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30 pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off its prediction.  College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. ""We felt that with a number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were certain A&M would carry this game. We may have been premature in our prediction.""

Thank you for your interest in our feature. As always, you can access the full document that surrounds these picks online at:  http://www.yahoo.com/picks/  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- Weekly Picks ------------------------------------------------------------------------  WW II Codes and Ciphers   http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/  This homespun site was created by Tony Sale, a man instrumental in preserving, restoring, and curating the historical collection at Bletchley Park. Headquarters of British code-breaking during World War II, Bletchley was ""Britain's best kept secret"" -- the place where the German Enigma was finally deciphered in an incredible cooperative super-effort. Detailed tutorials for the mathematically inclined explain how the Enigma cipher machine worked and how the Lorenz code was broken by the British-built Colossus machine. A Bletchley Park photo album presents snapshots of an ordinary-looking, extraordinary place.  --------------------  The Brownie Camera @ 100: A Celebration   http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/features/brownieCam/brownieCam.shtml  In February of 1900, the Eastman Kodak Company introduced the Brownie, a compact portable camera that cost $1. During the first year, over 150,000 cameras were sold. The Brownie was designed and intended for children, but it's explosive popularity led to the birth of popular photography, the rise of photojournalism, and the all-American snapshot. Kodak's gorgeously designed site offers dozens of recollections, original advertisements, audio commentary clips, and plenty of Brownie-shot snaps.  --------------------  BoondocksNet.com   http://www.boondocksnet.com/  This site was created by historian and Mark Twain scholar Jim Zwick. It began in early 1995 as a page about Twain's writing on the U.S. expansionist war in the Philippines; since then, it has become an essential library of historical texts, articles, photographs, and political cartoons for the study of imperialism and anti-imperialism in the late 19th and early 20th century. Remarkable e-texts and related gems include: Arthur Conan Doyle's The Crime of the Congo, Hull House founder Jane Addams' The Long Road of Woman's Memory, and an interpretive archive of 3D stereoscopic photographs. And the title? Boondocks, which means rough country, is derived from the Tagalog word for mountain, and entered American English around the time of the Phillipine-American War.  --------------------  Antimatter: Mirror of the Universe   http://livefromcern.web.cern.ch/livefromcern/antimatter/index2.html  From CERN in Switzerland, the amazing particle physics laboratory that brought us Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web, comes this introduction to antimatter. Tune in on November 21 to a live educational webcast produced in cooperation with San Francisco's Exploratorium or listen anytime to the archived presentation. Take a guided video tour of the Low Energy Anti-Proton Ring (LEAR), a particle accelerator that lets scientists create and observe antimatter in a quest to understand how the universe works. Read about Paul Dirac and the history of antimatter or see how it has seeped in to our daily lives.  --------------------  Utopia: The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World   http://www.nypl.org/utopia/  In bilingual collaboration with the BibliothSque nationale de France (France's national library), this exhibition explores the roots of utopian thinking from ancient traditions to modern times. Travel from the Garden of Eden to the City of God, then on to Thomas More's definitive 1516 work, Utopia, a word that means both ""good place"" and ""no place."" The exquisite image collection covers the Enlightenment, 19th-century revolutionary dreams, 20th-century dystopic nightmares, and 21st-century metaworlds. The paintings and illustrations will make you wish you were going nowhere too... or would that be Erewhon?  --------------------  This is SportsCenter   http://espn.go.com/thisissportscenter/  Which is better: ESPN's SportsCenter or the commercials for the show? If you're a fan of the latter, you'll enjoy this rotating selection of choice ads. No dumb beer ad humor here. SportsCenter ads are like tiny Saturday Night Live skits: self-deprecating, offbeat, and usually very funny, even if you don't like sports. So treat yourself to a two-minute sanity timeout.  --------------------  short stories at east of the web   http://www.short-stories.co.uk/  British web-design firm east of the web presents this splendid collection of short stories organized by theme: fiction, romance, crime, sci-fi & fantasy, humor, horror, hyperfiction, children's, and non-fiction. How perfectly civil of them. Most of the stories are wonderful, and thanks to public interest copyright law, they're all free. Read them onscreen, print them out for the train ride home, or download them onto your Palm Pilot.  --------------------  Lego Star Wars Trilogy   http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mbsf/  The product of over 2,500 hours of monomaniacal determination, the Lego Star Wars Trilogy recreates 180 key scenes from the original series. Relive all of those magical moments through Lego-lensed glasses: the Tatooine races, the Hoth battles, the Ewok dances. You won't find any Millennium Falcon or Imperial Walker Lego sets in stores; these are all custom-made models. As your Japanese host S.

Can someone explain that to me?  I do not get it.  I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand evil.  I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in Corps of Cadets uniforms.  ""Little Hitlers,"" they were called.  They were  being spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.  I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, ""Heil Hitler"" sign.   What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these things happened before kickoff.  Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.  Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will quickly teach those ""littlest"" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they get an honest chance to choose.  I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher ground.

Sorry, the complaint  form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the form is the same that hired there ticketing help.  -E  To whom it may concern:  I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful  except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.    I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for  Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride  (the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the  flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because  of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for  this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of  the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no  danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which  leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was  less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline  (Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us  to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that  we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible  to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this  connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on  flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.   It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my  vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.   I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed  our connection we were forced to spend a combined  6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose,  CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead  of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten  hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of  vacation.

If we aren't sick of seeing animals, there  is suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking  tours (the tours are only like an hour and a half).  After that- there is a  ferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del  Coronado.  It is suppose to be a really neat place.  Then- you we can finish  the day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown.  It is suppose to have a ""lively  evening street scene"" and live music.  What do you think?

Texas was 4-7 in  the season prior to Mack Brown.  The program was in shambles .  Mack Brown  came in late and was unable to salvage a recruiting class his first year.  Lo  and behold Texas goes 9-3, beat Nebraska in Lincoln (No. 3 at the time with  the longest home winning streak in recent history), and destroys Miss St in  the Cotton Bowl.   Those sound like some big wins don't they?  Does it sound  familiar?  I doubt you can compare the teams that LSU beat with the teams  Texas beat.  So my point is that players get up for new coaches.  You, as LSU  fans,  fans can expect about the same next year as this year.     Next year, is Texas' year ( and I know what you will say "" well that is what  you say every year""), but Mack's first true recruits will be juniors and his  first class (half his/half Mackovics) will be seniors.  So, if he doesn't win  the big game next year, then you can call him a bad coach.  I have a problem  saying he is  a bad coach after he has put together 3 straight 9 win seasons.  As a side note,  look who won the national championship game - the Big 12.   If I am not mistaken, that makes the big 12 4-3  in the bowls while the Sec  was 4-5.  If not for a bumbled extra point and a few dropped passes the 12  would be 6-1 and the sec 3-6.  I see the beginnings of a new college fb  powerhouse conference.  The Big 12 will win at least the next  2 NCs.

I have a  question:  How many top recruiting classes does it take for Texas to win a  few big games in a single football season.  Dinnardo left LSU's recruiting  program in shambles.  Last year was one of the worst recruiting seasons in  LSU team history.  However, WE still managed to pull off some amazing team  victories this year.  If there is one thing I learned from watching LSU this season, its that its  nice to have talent on your team but its more important to have HEART and  PRIDE.  So keep watching your Texas big names choke and I'll keep watching  our TIGER No-Names win.  As Always, its all in Good Fun.  CKL        Enron North America Corp.

Brian Hoskins@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/09/2001 10:13 AM To: Hector Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECT, Luis Mena/NA/Enron@ENRON, Lenine  Jeganathan/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: all Hector wants for christmas...    Vietnamese War Refugee Becomes Successful  Cookbook Author in America  Dulles, VA -- (Xpress Press)-- Successful  Georgetown clothing designer Diana My Tran,  celebrates the culture of her homeland in  THE VIETNAMESE COOKBOOK, an easy-to-follow  guide to Vietnamese cuisine.  In 1975 Diana Tran left Vietnam as part of  a mass exodus when Saigon fell to Ho Chi  Minh's North Vietnamese troops. The pregnant  20-year-old had no idea where she was going  or what she would do when she arrived, and  was forced to make a new life for herself  in a foreign country.  Over the past two  decades she has gone from not knowing a word  of English to being a successful clothing  designer and dressmaker, with clients in the  upper echelons of politics, media, and society.  Yet despite her success in America, Diana  staunchly holds on to her Vietnamese heritage.  ""I want to keep our family heritage alive, es- pecially for my children.  The easiest way to  do that is through the food.""  She says that  when she first came to America, she missed the  many joyous family celebrations and their acc- ompanying feasts, and tried to recreate them  for her new friends in America.  ""When I first arrived in America, cooking  Vietnamese dishes was a challenge, because  there were no Asian food stores in Carlisle PA.   Most of the time I could not find the tradi- tional ingredients and had to make substitutions,  but the food turned out just fine,"" she says.  Diana recorded all of these substitutions in  her cookbook, keeping the original tastes and  textures. The recipes make use of ingredients  easily found in local supermarkets, and show  step-by-step instructions for making the healthy  delights of Vietnamese cuisine fast and simply.  ""My time for cooking is as limited as it ever  was when I was a new immigrant,"" Tran says.   ""Traditional Vietnamese food can take time and  effort to prepare-time I usually don't have, so  I have created my own easier versions of Vietn- amese dishes, tailored to the busy American  lifestyle.""  Diana's cookbook has been featured in The  Washington Post, The Chicago Sun-Times, Charlotte  Observer, Arkansas Democrat Gazette, and the  Portland Press-Herald.   Diana has also appeared  on Fox Noon News in Washington, DC and Poor Man's  Kitchen in Seattle, WA. She is available for inter- views about her family's flight from Saigon and her  American success story.

However, we were going to play this weekend but there are a lot of people who are unable to play due to previous engagements so we are going to reschedule it for Saturday, January 20, 2001.  It will cost about $22.00 and that includes admission for the whole day, rental of the gun and one Co2 cartridge.  However, paintballs are extra and they cost about $6.50 per 100.  If we do end up playing it would be recommend to bring a sandwich and drinks because there is not much out there.  If you could, please RSVP by Wednesday, January 17, 2001, that way we can decide if we have enough people to even play.  Rain or Shine!

Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after midnight Monday.  Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip.  On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned. The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the .22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column.  After inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly and the two men proceeded toward the White River bridge. After traveling about 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle swerved sharply right exiting the pavement and striking a tree.  Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but will require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released.  ""Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls off or we might both be dead"" stated Wallis.  ""I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident happened,"" said Snyder.  Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife asked how many frogs the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck. Way to go, Lavinia) >>   > J.

If you are remotely interested, e-mail me your name and phone  number, so I can create a contact list to pass out to everyone.  I don't have  any flags or field cones, but if we get enough people interested, I'm sure  Enron will sponsor us (if you have flags and/or cones, please bring them;  I'll bring the football).  The location of our games will be at the practice field, East of the Rice U.  stadium (across the parking lot).  I believe our playing field is on Rice  University Blvd., between gates 12 and 13.  The field has two field goals and  bleachers.  It's hard to miss!  I hope everyone is interested.  If not, we didn't need your slow, lazy,  unathletic ass anyway...

LET IT REALLY  SINK IN.? THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU  START YOUR DAY.   Michael is the  kind of guy you love to hate. He is  always in a good  mood  and   always has something positive to say.? When someone  would ask him  how  he  was  doing, he would reply, ""If I were any better, I would   be twins!""   He was a natural motivator.? If an employee was  having  a bad day,  Michael  was there telling the employee how to look  on the  positive side of the  situation.   Seeing this style really  made me curious, so one day I  went up to  Michael  and asked him, ""I  don't get it! You can't be a  positive person all of  the  time.   How do you do it?""   Michael replied, ""Each morning I wake up and say  to  myself, you have  two  choices today.? You can choose to be in  a good mood  or...you can choose?  to  be in a bad  mood.?  I choose to be in a good mood.? Each time  something bad happens,  I   can choose to be a victim or...I can choose to learn  from it. I choose   to  learn from it.  Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can   choose to accept  their  complaining or...I can point out the positive  side of  life. I choose  the  positive side of life.   ""Yeah,  right, it's not that easy,"" I protested.   ""Yes, it is,"" Michael said.  ""Life is all about  choices. When you cut  away  all the junk, every  situation is a choice. You choose  how you react to  situations. You  choose how people affect your mood.  You choose to be in  a  good mood  or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your  choice how you live  your   life.""   I reflected on what Michael said. Soon hereafter, I  left  the Tower  Industry  to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often   thought about him  when  I made a choice about life instead of  reacting to it.   Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved   in a serious  accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications   tower.? After 18  hours  of surgery and weeks of intensive care,  Michael was  released from the  hospital with rods placed in his back.    I saw Michael about six months after the accident.  When I asked him  how  he  was, he replied. ""If I were any better, I'd be twins.  Wanna  see my  scars?""   I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what   had gone through  his  mind as the accident took place. ""The first  thing that  went through my  mind  was the well-being of my soon to be  born daughter, ""  Michael replied.  ""Then,  as I lay on the ground, I  remembered that I had two  choices: I could  choose  to live or ...I  could choose to die. I chose to live.""   ""Weren't you scared? Did you lose  consciousness?"" I  asked. Michael  continued, ""...the paramedics were  great. They kept  telling me I was  going  to be fine. But when they  wheeled me into the ER and I  saw the  expressions  on the faces of the  doctors and nurses, I got really  scared.? In their  eyes,  I read  ""he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take  action.""   ""What did you  do?"" I asked.   ""Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions   at me,"" said  Michael.  ""She asked if I was allergic to anything.  ""Yes, I  replied."" The doctors  and  nurses stopped working as they  waited for my reply. I  took a deep  breath  and  yelled, ""Gravity.""    Over their laughter, I told them, ""I am choosing to  live. Operate on  me  as  if I am alive, not dead.""   Michael lived, thanks to the  skill of his doctors, but  also because of  his  amazing attitude. I  learned from him that every day we  have the choice  to  live fully.  Attitude, after all, is everything.  ""Therefore do not worry  about  tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.   After all today is the  tomorrow you worried about  yesterday.   You have two choices now:   1. Delete this.  2. Forward it to the people you care about.   You  know the choice I made.

We need to draft this week.  I will set the rotation by number of tickets  purchased to start the rotation then random draw.  In other words I will pick  1st, Greg 2nd, Stacey & Jason 3rd & 4th ( I will flip a coin that day) and Eric , Elsa and  Danny to follow ( we will draw an order that day).   So in summary there are 16  packages of 5 games; so every 16 games I will get  5, Greg 4, Jason  and Stacey 2, and the other 3 one. So round 1 would look like this:   1) Gary  2) Greg  3) Jason/Stacey  4) Jason/Stacey  Picks 5-16 will then be pulled out of a hat to determine order for all  remaining picks with Gary's name 4 times, Greg 3 times, and every one else  once. We need to do this this week.  How about Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday from  11:00 - 1:00 (we should finish earlier).  The schedule is at astros.mlb.com  or I will bring hard copies for you.

"Brett,  Just thought I'd drop you a line.  Cool site, I guess you have too much spare time on your hands.   Nothing too exciting is going on here in h-town - just working.  I am trading gas futures and other derivatives for Enron- it can get exciting at times (lots of $ flying trading hands), but I haven't got to blow anything up like you, so I feel that my life is somewhat lacking.   Big news on Marilyn - I had thought that you broke up before your foray to Ft. Sill.  Do you get to see each other much?    Where are you currently stationed?

To  MOM ...in Seattle, Washington From your  daughter...Abigail...in Los Angeles   Dear Mom: As I watch the  inaugural, I am still crushed that Al Gore did not get in office. Look at  that Texas jerk with the cowboy hat on!! What a disgrace. And look how  immoral he is...getting a ticket for drunken driving 24 years  ago!!   And....aren't you so excited? Jesse Jackson has a new  child !! I sent him $5.  I used to send him $50...but my electric  bill was $2,345 last month, and I was short of cash. That is not  bad, though...Susan's bill was $3000 because she has a TWO-bedroom  apartment. I am hoping to meet Jesse's new girl friend out here. I think  she is living with his other girl friend from 1996. (Or maybe it was the  1994 one.... I forgot.)   I love California...everything is  so ""environmentally correct"" here. And all our liberal friends are in  power now. I am sure glad we demonstrated against building all those power  plants 8 years ago...or else this state would be polluted like Texas  and Georgia.  My friends and I are going out tomorrow to demonstrate  against that nuclear power plant they recently re-opened. We shut that  down in 1994, and I think some Republican sons of b------ are re-opening  it. Probably just to keep the businesses going. GEEZ!!    Well...don't call me on Mondays, Wednesdays, or Fridays because those are  the designated days with no electricity. Not on Tuesdays or Thursdays  either...because those are the designated days with no water or  phones.  Call me on Saturday between 3 and 4 PM....usually we  have power then. I don't understand why states with lots of power like  Texas and Georgia don't try to help us out.   We won't have to  worry much longer about pollution because all the businesses are shutting  down, and there is no jet fuel for the airlines.  And gas is $8.50 a  gallon...so no one can afford to drive.   I LOVE California !!  Thank God for the Democrats !!

The highest scoring team will receive 1 point and the lowest scoring team will receive 10 points.  Each Thursday at 12pm we will conduct a free agent draft.  You must submit a list of the players you want to bid on with the points you bid on them to an email address yet to be determined.  After 12pm the highest bidder for each player will we awarded the free agent.  You can bid 0 points for a player but will lose if anyone else bids at least 1 point.

Every thing is pretty hectic  here, rumors flyin a mile a minute, but just like everything else in the  military rumors are just rumors until they actually happen, nothin is ever  set in stone.

They all enjoy a good >laugh. They make the best of friends.

Not a big one; instead like the pilot >light in a gas stove. And when you put more gas there, the flame >gets bigger, enough to cook with. Inside every one of these people >is something else, something you have to look for - pride. They know >that they are good at their work, in the event they ever have to do >it for real. This doesn't happen very often, and indeed they do not >ordinarily lust to do it because it's a serious, nasty job.

This is not something to be undertaken lightly, >because life is a gift from God, and a lot of these people - kids, really -  >can be found in church on Sunday mornings. But their larger purpose - the  >reason these kids enlist, both in my country and in yours - is to preserve,  >protect, and defend their nations and the citizens who live there. It's not  >an easy job, but someone has to do it, and typically the hardest jobs  >attract the best of us. Mostly they never have to kill anybody, and that's  >okay with them. It's knowing that >they are able to do something difficult and dangerous that gives >them their pride. > >This purpose, defending their country, is something they don't talk >much about, but it's always there, and with it comes a quiet, steely look  >in the eyes. Especially when something like this happens. That's >when their sense of self is insulted, and these are people who do >not bear insults well. They are protectors, and when those whom they >are sworn to protect are hurt, then comes the desire - the lust - to >perform their mission. Even then it's quiet. They will not riot or >pose before TV cameras or cry aloud for action, because that's not >their way. They are the point of the lance, the very breath of the >dragon, and at times like this they want to know the taste of blood. > >Their adversaries just don't appreciate what they are capable of. >It's something too divorced from their experience. This isn't like hosing  >civilians with your machine-gun or setting off a bomb somewhere, or killing  >unarmed people strapped and helpless inside a commercial >aircraft. This means facing professional warriors at a time and >place of their choosing, and that is something terrorists don't >really prepare for. The day of Pearl Harbor, the commander of the >Japanese navy told his staff not to exult too much, that all their >beautifully executed operation had accomplished was to awaken a >sleeping dragon and give it a dreadful purpose. > >Perhaps alone in his country, Isoroku Yamamoto, who had lived >briefly in America, knew what his enemy was capable of, and for that  >reason, perhaps he was not surprised when the .50-caliber bullet from a  >P-38 fighter entered his head and ended his life. > >Whoever initiated last week's operation is probably not quite as >appreciative of what he has begun as Yamamoto was.

(ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31, 2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control.    In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005.    In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excess parachute payment,"" according to the filing.    Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion.    The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment within the 60 days.

Nov. 12, 2001, 10:23PM Jackson says coalition wants role in energy deal  By NELSON ANTOSH  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle  Activist Jesse Jackson says the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition intends to be a part of the regulatory process leading to the closing of the Enron-Dynegy deal.  The organization, which he founded, owns Enron stock and shares in several other large Houston-based energy firms.  ""Dynegy needs our participation to get approval,"" Jackson said Monday.  The organization's interest in the acquisition of Enron by Dynegy is in assuring minority inclusion in any possible spinoffs, employment, contract commitments and EEOC rulings.  Jackson is here for the first annual energy summit conducted by the Houston bureau of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Wall Street Project. The summit continues today in the Hyatt Regency downtown.  Those companies played a role in this conference that suggests they are in touch with Jackson already. On Monday he praised Enron head Ken Lay's integrity although the Enron executive is on the other end of the political spectrum.  Lay and Dynegy's chief executive officer, Chuck Watson, would have been at the group's energy summit if it weren't for the announcement last week that turned everything topsy-turvy, Jackson said.  The coalition opened its Houston bureau in May on Smith Street so it can do research, go to annual meetings and distribute information, Jackson said.  Protests and boycotts are not part of the plan, said William-Paul Thomas, the bureau chief here.  The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, which Jackson heads, has taken an interest in energy and Houston in particular, as demonstrated by his appearance at the Offshore Technology Conference here early this year.  Blacks and Hispanics have been locked out of employment, upper-level management and contracts, Jackson said.  Jackson lamented the lack of emphasis on energy security now that the nation's attention has turned to terrorists and anthrax.  He also took the opportunity, in an interview, to criticize President Bush's plans for stimulating the economy from the top down, with a tax plan that will benefit large corporations to the tune of billions of dollars.  ""It must be bottom up,"" Jackson said.  One-third of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's idea for economic stimulation is travel vouchers, worth $1,000 each and good for up to six months.  This would help employment in the hard-hit travel and vacation industries during the holiday season, he said.

PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS  The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks,  with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule,  Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds  they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not  determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets.  The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding  the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your  regular season.   If your team is still in contention, go to  NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes  during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be  available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff  matchup.   GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS  Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the  common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.   MVP.com   Save 10% on Speak No Evil, Hear No Evil Monkey Bikes...

We  invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on  players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance  to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like  yourself!    Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot.  Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin  Muhammad in week ten?   G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston  has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing  playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from  a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last  weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success  against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with  Muhammad.   Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.     G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?    G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.

He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.     FANTASY FOOTBALL RADIO SHOW  Fantasy Football on Live Radio!

Gentlemen and ladies,  Check it out, OSU beat OU (NO ONE thought THAT was possible) we are going to  the Big 12 Championship game VS. Colorado.  Damn we're smooth.   Hook'em Horns.  Brett.  AUSTIN -- Texas coach Mack Brown was channel surfing through college  football Saturday, hoping his team would get a break.  It wasn't too long before his television was locked in on the second half of  Oklahoma State's 16-13 upset of Oklahoma.  His phone was ringing off the hook as the final seconds ticked down. Brown's  fifth-ranked Longhorns were now Big 12 South Division champs and headed to  the conference title game next Saturday against Colorado.  ""I had some players calling and screaming with 20 seconds left,"" Brown said.  ""Our two sons and my wife were screaming and shouting like they were on the  sidelines. We had some unsportsmanlike conduct there, I think.""  Brown said he tried to stay calm after the Cowboys took the lead in the  final two minutes. He was trying to figure out how many timeouts and how  much yardage the Sooners needed to pull off the victory or at least tie and  send it to overtime.  ""That's what coaches do,"" Brown said. ""We're trying to figure out how to win  the game.""  Ranked 11th or higher all season, Texas (10-1, 7-1 Big 12) had been on the  outside looking in at the South division title. The Sooners handed Texas its  only defeat back in October and had the head-to-head advantage before  Saturday.  The Sooners were heavy favorites to beat Oklahoma State before the loss  dropped the Sooners to 10-2 overall, 6-2 in the Big 12.  ""You really don't know in this crazy game of college football what's going  to happen,"" Brown said. ""As of yesterday, nobody thought Colorado and Texas  would be in this ball game.""  Colorado (9-2, 7-1) won the North division with its 62-36 whipping of  Nebraska on Friday, a game the Texas players could listen to on their way  home from a 21-7 win over Texas A&M.  The Longhorns defeated Colorado 41-7 back in October. Brown said the rematch  should be much closer.  ""We won the game handily but they had some turnovers early in the game.  Obviously they're playing much better now than they were then,"" he said.  Colorado coach Gary Barnett said his team is happy to have another crack at  Texas.  ""We'll be primed for the rematch,"" Barnett said. ""We know we didn't play  very well the first time and we'd like to think that wasn't who we really  are.""    _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp",brettlawler@hotmail.com,eric.bass@enron.com,RE: Yeah Orange....,2001-11-27 07:56:14-08:00,sent

If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.    A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999, and the early morning hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999: 6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels  7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning) 8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer) 8:53 Crack open second beer 8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea) 10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 10:35 Headed for San Antonio 10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam 11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl. And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I RULE the pre-game kingdom. 2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy. 2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas. 3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas. Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy from the Traveler. 3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone. Safety. 3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler. 4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom: ""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused. 4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska is a bunch of pussies. 4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives. I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants. 5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.  5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."" 5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter. As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the fucking PA system??!!"" 5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"", and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone. I cheer wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty. 6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship. 6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer. It is warm. I don't care. 7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig. 7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them. I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami. The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care. 8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own. I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon."" 8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage. I tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly. 8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to kick the shit out of Arizona. 9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a ""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me. 9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can. Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center, much less Bud Light out of a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light. 9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my bearings. I have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing. 10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off. 10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects. However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a bit seriously."" 10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look like I should be in an episode of Cops. 10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving. 10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I take a nap. 11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck."" 11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""  11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""  11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""  11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility, and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon."" 12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to my vehicle. 12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die tonight. 12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee. He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's. 1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder. 1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear ""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers. 2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell him to keep it. 2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated immediately. 2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings. 2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads on the table. The waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a shit. The tab is $112 with tip. 2:46 I'm sleepy. 9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.","e-mail <.brett@enron.com>, patrick.ryder@enron.com, m..love@enron.com,   d..winfree@enron.com",eric.bass@enron.com,FW: [Fwd: a day in the life],2001-11-28 05:58:19-08:00,sent

If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.    A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999, and the early morning hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999: 6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels  7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning) 8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer) 8:53 Crack open second beer 8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea) 10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 10:35 Headed for San Antonio 10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam 11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the sky. About 70 degrees. 11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself. 12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us). We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas. AWESOME MOMENT. 12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs. Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. 1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants. 1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl. And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame.

I should get to watch the game this saturday and am pretty pumped  about it.  What all events would have to occur for us to get a Rose Bowl slot?  Yeah, I'm still in HI for another year to year and a half.  I'm going to  Telluride with Marilyn from 22 Dec to 27 Dec to do the whole proposal thing  then I leave Hou on the 2nd of Jan.

"Hey Brett,  Good to hear from you.  It is pretty bad at Enron.  I still have a job for the time being but things are in limbo right now.  The good news is that my division (trading ops) is the most valuable and desirable for any acquisition.  The bad news is that we could declare bankruptcy at any time and that would leave our fate in the hands of the creditors and the courts.  It is sad to see a good company like this fold despite the fact that we make a great deal of money.   Oh well, things will work out.  As far as the Rose Bowl, I think we have a pretty good shot.  Currently we are 3rd in the BCS rankings (the top two go to the National Championship game -- which is the Rose Bowl this year).  The two teams ahead of us are Miami (1) and Florida (2).  If either one loses (Miami at Virginia Tech this week and Florida vs Tennesee and possible SEC championship game) we should get into the top 2.  Of course, we have to win on Saturday as well.  This has been a wacky year in college football, so I think our chances are pretty good.  Good luck on the proposal.  You are about to venture to the Dark Side.  Telluride should be fun.  We went there last year for a ski trip (again).  I might be venturing down that path soon.  I should be here when you are in town so drop me a line or give me a call (H: 713-661-2601 or Cell:713-628-3104 or Work (hopefully): 713-853-0977).    Take Care.

"No problem.  Thanks for playing.  Hopefully we can keep in touch and have the same people next year.  I will be settling the league up shortly and will send you a check.  How are things going otherwise?  -Eric  -----Original Message----- From: Reagan Mathews [mailto:reaganmathews@yahoo.com] Sent: Tuesday, January 01, 2002 10:28 AM To: ebass@enron.com Subject: End of Season   Eric,  Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick in the draft.  Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building, it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the mail:  Reagan Mathews 17210 Canyon Stream Ct. Houston, TX  77095  By my calculation the amount should be: $608.5  (1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.  $28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40.   The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the ""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the $50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a different number for the distributions.  -Reagan    __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets.   Tyrone Wheatley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 01/08/02 Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. ""He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line),"" Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . ""The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin."" Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries.   Bills <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02 Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. ""My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates,"" Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.  Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 01/08/02 Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary.   Dolphins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=15&>, DT MIA - Martin Updated 01/08/02 Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason.   Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02 Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore.   Antonio Freeman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 01/08/02 Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns.   D'Wayne Bates <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. ""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll! s! ee where he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games.   Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 01/08/02 Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami.   Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 01/08/02 Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale.   Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks.   Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Corner! ba! ck Shawn Springs started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.   Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1296&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown.   Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 01/07/02 Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks.   Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 01/07/02 Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks.   Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns.   Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week.   Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 01/07/02 Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game.   Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 01/07/02 Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks.   Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 01/07/02 Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year.   Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 01/07/02 Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter.   Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 01/07/02 Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns.   Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 01/07/02 Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform.   Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 01/07/02 Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. Furth! er! tests are expected to be taken this week.   Mike Hollis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1387&>, K JAC - Giggles Updated 01/07/02 Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season.   Marcus Pollard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 Pollard left Sunday's game against Denver in the third quarter with a sprained left knee.

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 01/07/02 Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win.   Terrell Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 01/07/02 According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe."" Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.  Jason Elam <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1383&>, K DEN - Martin Updated 01/07/02 According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. ""I've met every goal that I had coming into the season,"" Elam said. ""I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better."" Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

"Eric,  Good to hear from you.  Hope you had a good Christmas and New Year's vacation.  I just got back to Boston last night.  I was in KY until the 30th then went skiing in Colorado (Copper and Winter Park) with some friends from here.  The snow wasn't great at Copper, but Winter Park was great and snowed the entire time we were there.  It's nice to be back at school, but I'm not looking forward to studying again.  Crossword puzzles and mutual fund research sound glorious right now.  Finals weren't too bad at all.  Normal classes are pretty intense, so there isn't much you can do in the way of preparation except relax and get plenty of sleep.    Glad to hear that you still have a job.  I've been keeping up with Enron in the papers.  What's the latest on the trading division sale?  I knew that Citigroup had made a bid, but is anyone else expected to come in?  Summer internship interviews are coming up, so I'm sure I'll have plenty to talk about with Enron on my resume.  How are all of our friends making out?  I got an email from Plauche that he had been laid off.  What about Lenhart, Boucher, Chad, and everyone else?    My dentist is Brian Kilgore, whom I liked very much.  He's out on I-10 and the Beltway.  He referred me to Thomas Weiler for the wisdom teeth surgery.  I think he's covered under the Enron dental plan, too.    Enjoy the downtime while you have it.  Say hello to your family for me.

However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary.   Dolphins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=15&>, DT MIA - Martin Updated 01/08/02 Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason.   Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02 Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo.

""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll! s! ee where he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games.

He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami.   Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 01/08/02 Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale.   Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks.   Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Corner! ba! ck Shawn Springs started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.   Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1296&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown.   Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 01/07/02 Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks.   Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 01/07/02 Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks.   Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns.   Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week.   Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 01/07/02 Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game.   Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 01/07/02 Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks.   Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 01/07/02 Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year.   Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 01/07/02 Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter.   Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 01/07/02 Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns.   Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 01/07/02 Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform.   Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 01/07/02 Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. Furth! er! tests are expected to be taken this week.   Mike Hollis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1387&>, K JAC - Giggles Updated 01/07/02 Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season.   Marcus Pollard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02 Pollard left Sunday's game against Denver in the third quarter with a sprained left knee. He finished the contest with two catches for 11 yards in the Colts' 29-10 victory.   James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 01/07/02 Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win.   Terrell Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 01/07/02 According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe."" Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.  Jason Elam <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1383&>, K DEN - Martin Updated 01/07/02 According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. ""I've met every goal that I had coming into the season,"" Elam said. ""I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better."" Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

"Hey Brian,  The auction process concludes today and we should no who the winning bid is tomorrow.  It looks like it will be either UBS or Citigroup.  As far as our friends go: Bryan Hull got laid off and is looking for a job - he actually got offered to move back to risk but decided not to take the job b/c he thought he had something else in the bag - it turned out that he didn't;  Matt Lenhart - is still here and is in the same boat as I am; Tim Boucher - is still here and is handling the liquidation of EES' retail book - he may or may not continue on with EES depending on whether or not another company is willing to take a chance on EES - apparently there are some pkg deals in the works - he is also interviewing with other companies; Chad got laid off and is touring Europe for a month; Gillette got laid off and moved to India to teach English to young Indians (how crazy is she?); and Shanna still has a job at Enron in tax (the gov't always gets there $$) she is also looking for another job.   I think that just about covers everything.  I am sure that you have talked to Lenny and know his situation.  How is Hector holding up? I never hear anything from him - tell him I said hello.

Hope you had a good Christmas and New Year's vacation.  I just got back to Boston last night.  I was in KY until the 30th then went skiing in Colorado (Copper and Winter Park) with some friends from here.  The snow wasn't great at Copper, but Winter Park was great and snowed the entire time we were there.  It's nice to be back at school, but I'm not looking forward to studying again.  Crossword puzzles and mutual fund research sound glorious right now.  Finals weren't too bad at all.  Normal classes are pretty intense, so there isn't much you can do in the way of preparation except relax and get plenty of sleep.    Glad to hear that you still have a job.  I've been keeping up with Enron in the papers.  What's the latest on the trading division sale?  I knew that Citigroup had made a bid, but is anyone else expected to come in?  Summer internship interviews are coming up, so I'm sure I'll have plenty to talk about with Enron on my resume.  How are all of our friends making out?  I got an email from Plauche that he had been laid off.  What about Lenhart, Boucher, Chad, and everyone else?    My dentist is Brian Kilgore, whom I liked very much.  He's out on I-10 and the Beltway.  He referred me to Thomas Weiler for the wisdom teeth surgery.  I think he's covered under the Enron dental plan, too.    Enjoy the downtime while you have it.

"Good morning. Yes, I did look at the annuity link. It looks good to me. It is run by an insurance company. Thus, I assume there will be not only the standard fees charged by whatever mutual fund in which you invest, but some charge made by the ins. co. Thus, you should make certain those charges are reasonable and defined. Additional, if the your money is actually paid by you to the ins. co.( verses directly to the specific mutual funds) to be invested, which I suspect is the case, then you must select a financially strong ins.co. Do not want an Enron fiasco with this type of retirement investment. Let me know if you have any questions.

"Eric,   Thanks for the news on our friends.  It sounds like everyone's getting along pretty well, all things considered.  I saw Enron on NBC Nightly News last night.  Tom Brokaw had a long special on the Congressional inquiry, and they had some footage of people leaving the building.  I also saw a shot of the trading floor on CNN yesterday from last year.  I saw Dick Jenkins, but couldn't see if there was anyone else I knew.  It's amusing to see how the media reports so many half-truths and misleading information.     I got a call from Hector the other day but haven't had a chance to talk to him.  He recently got a job with the Clinton group in NYC, so he's pretty excited about that.  That's great that your brother's wedding is coming up.  Tell him congratulations for me.  Are you the best man?   Hope the bidding turns out well.  Happy surfing in the meantime!

I was thinking about all meeting in the  AMC theater parking lot on the north side, @ Sam Houston Tollroad and Richmond. Plenty of lighted parking and kinda centrally located. But, I am flexible.

I love you not because of who you are, but because of  who I am when I am with you.                      2. No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who  is, won't make you cry.                      3. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want  them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.                     4. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and  touches your heart.                      5. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right  beside them knowing you can't have them.                      6. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never  know who is falling in love with your smile.                      7. To the world you may be one person, but to one person  you may be the world.                      8. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't  willing to waste their time on you.                      9. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before  meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know  how to be grateful.                      10. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it  happened.                      11. There's always going to be people that hurt you so  what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who  you trust next time around.                      12. Make yourself a better person and know who you are  before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.                      13. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you  least expect them to.                      REMEMBER: WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON.                      True friends: How many people actually have 8 true  friends?                     Hardly anyone I know ! But some of us have all right  friends and good friends!!!

Kurtis was almost finished, and  wanted to get some fresh air, and decided to answer the call.  As he approached the check-out stand a  distant smile caught his eye, the new check out girl was beautiful.  She was an older woman (maybe  26, and he was only 22) and he fell in love.  Later that day, after his shift was over, he waited by the punch clock to find out her name.  She came into the break room, smiled softly at him and took her card and  punched out, then left.  He looked at her card, BRENDA.  He walked out only to see her start walking up the road.  Next day, he waited outside as she left the supermarket, and offered her a ride home.  He looked harmless enough, and she accepted.  When he dropped her off, he asked if maybe he could see her again, outside of work.  She simply said it wasn't possible.  He pressed and she explained she had two children and she couldn't afford a baby-sitter, so he offered to pay for the baby-sitter. Reluctantly she accepted his offer for a date for the following Saturday.  That Saturday night he arrived at her door only to have her tell him that she was unable to go with him.  The baby-sitter had called and canceled.  To which Kurtis simply said, ""Well, lets take the kids with us.""  She tried to explain that taking the children was not an option, but again not taking no for an answer, he pressed.  Finally Brenda, brought him inside to meet her children.  She had an older daughter who was just cute a bug, Kurtis thought, then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair, he was born a paraplegic with down syndrome.  Kurtis asked Brenda, ""I still don't understand why the kids can't come with us?""  Brenda was amazed.  Most men would run away  from a woman with two kids, especially if one had disabilities.  Just like her first husband and  father of her children did.  That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the kids, went to dinner and the movies.  When her son needed anything Kurtis would take care of him.  When he needed to use the rest room, he picked him up out of his chair, took him, brought him back.  The kids loved Kurtis.  At the end of the evening, Brenda knew this was the man she was going to marry and spend the rest of her life with. A year later, they were married and Kurtis adopted both of her children and since they have added two more kids.  So what happened to the stock boy and check out girl?
