I have discussed credit related matters with Heather Scott from PC, and she  is ok with the amendments that I have proposed.  She understands where ECC is  coming from and is hopeful that before we ask PC for a LC we ensure that the  credit allocations with PC are set up properly. ( that's step 1).  Then ECC  can make the proper determination on exposures.  Prior to a LC request, PC  would like to work on commercial initiatives if possible.   1) Peter/Mark can we raise the letters that will amend the agreements as  required?  2) Change collateral Threshold on the Master Firm between PCOG and ECC from  25,000,000 US$ to  $ 45,000,000 US $. 3) Reduce collateral Threshold on Master Swap between PC and ECC from $  25,000,000 US$ to $ 5,000,000 US$. 4) Mark, can you please review the corporate structure of PCHC ( US)  regarding either Limited tor General Partnership and the issue related to the  Guarentee that we have from PC. ( have they capped their liability to us or  is this a redundant provision?).   Heather Scott will be away on holidays from today until the 18th of July.

You are using some early estimates of fuel I gave you.  You know you should not trust me.  We have some better numbers now.  It turns out that our average fuel usage rate for calendar 2000 was .0044 % per pipeline mile.  Stretching this out over 612 miles, KG to Malin yields a rate of 2.69%.  This is just one place to start when examining the impact of the expansion.  The modeling of the expansion yields an incremental rate for the 200,000 mcfd of 7.46%.  If you combine those on a weighted average you will get 3.24%.  The quantities at KG are significantly higher than in your estimate.  Regardless, these are the numbers we are currently predicting.  The actuals will be different and perhaps lower as the operators optimize the system performance.  Who knows.  Also we are predicting that the pipeline looping will be constructed in advance and put into service ahead of the compression.  So on a long term basis (like the first year) the fuel rate will decrease due to the  looping.  -----Original Message----- From: Stephanie.Miller@enron.com [mailto:Stephanie.Miller@enron.com] Sent: Wednesday, April 04, 2001 3:31 PM To: Schoene, Jim Subject: Re: PG&E Gas Transmission Quarterly Meeting    I had promised that I would send my fuel calculation over!

It is possible PGT might claim the increasing fuel cost parts of your intervention as ""unsubstantiated"" and therefore should be excluded and ignored by the Commission.  <<PGTfuel.xls>>  There could well be a case for roll-in.  If there is, PGT didn't include it in their filing.  I guess we will see how it all shakes out.  It's interesting no-one has yet asked FERC to require a new rate case by a specific date or to force the trivial rate reduction through to Shippers.  Tim     Estimate of marginal/incremental fuel consumption due to new capacity:  NEW CONTRACTS 210,800 dt; 612.46 mi =>  (210,800)/(1 -0.0050%*612.46)*(612.46) = 133,185,095 dt-miles/day   20,380 dt; 612.46 mi => (20,380)/(1 -0.0050%*612.46)*(612.46) = 12,876,244 dt-miles/day      annual average (5 mo winter, 7 mo summer) = 138,550,197 dt-miles/day  BASE CASE, FULL EXISTING SYSTEM 1.385 e9 dt-miles/day, useage of 68.6 Mdt/day, or 0.0050%/mile  MARGINAL FUEL PERCENTAGE ESTIMATE 0.0101 %/mile, slope of line from chart 'ex5' as computed on sheet 'regr' Sheet 'ex8' has all the historical data points and their derivations.  Additional Fuel estimate 0.0101 %/mile * 138,550,197 dt-miles/day = 14.0 Mdt/day  Total Fuel Used 68.6 + 14.0 = 82.6 Mdt/day  Total Throughput 1.385 + 0.139 = 1.524 e9 dt-mi/day  Estimated resultant average fuel: 82.6 Mdt/day / 1.524 e9 dt-mi/day = 0.00542 %/mile.  Increase in average fuel to existing shippers 0.00542%/mile - 0.0050%/mile = 0.00042 %/mile 612.46 mi * 0.00042 %/mile = 0.257% on a Kingsgate-to-Malin path. At $5.00 /dt, 0.257%*$5 = $0.013 /dt  Since the combined toll (cash toll plus fuel value) goes up, PGT must make a case that roll-in is beneficial.    The previous filings by PGT that provide the historical data are: 12/22/93 RP94-88 5/31/94  TM94-3-86 12/1/94  TM95-2-86 5/31/95  TM95-3-86 12/1/95  TM96-3-86 5/31/96  TM96-4-86 11/27/96 TM97-2-86 5/29/97  TM97-3-86 11/26/97 TM98-2-86 5/29/98  TM98-3-86 12/1/98  TM99-1-86 6/1/99  TM99-3-86 12/1/99  RP00-109 5/30/00  RP00-304 12/1/00  RP01-153   - PGTfuel.xls     <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>",barry.tycholiz@enron.com,stephanie.miller@enron.com,FW: PGT CP01-141 Fuel and Roll-In,2001-04-27 13:21:00-07:00,received

I also selected an inventory capacity of 500,000 GJ (Approximately 0.5 BCF), although I can price out the AECO storage at utilizing different Withdrawal/Injection rates as well as different Capacities if you desire.  Proposal #1 (10 Month) Contract Profile: Standard Profile where Withdrawal/Injection rates are tied to daily inventory levels, see table below for rate details.

Apparently, the Commission has received comments from the state's LDCs (and maybe others, although the article didn't speak to them).

"Hey there Barry! No, I never heard from him. Guess I will drop him another note and see how he is surviving this series! We actually went to get the Av's in NJ. Lisa, Lynn, myself and another girl who is flying the Laker trips with us got snagged to fly the trip since we were sitting around with nothing to do until Sat. when we go to Philly. I guess they decided rather than pay us for sitting on our butts they would put us to work! I am not particularly fond of their players. Some of them are OK. Joe Sakic is nice. And of course, I got to see Rob Blake which was a plus. He just doesn't look right in that Av uniform, or sitting on the plane in a different seat with all of those ""other"" guys around him! Patrick Roy sits in the seat he use to sit in with the Kings, so I guess we know who won out on that deal! I sure wouldn't ask him to get up! Yikes, he scares me! Now, Bob Hartley, he is THE nicest guy! And not bad to look at either! All of the coaches are nice, and quite amusing! Until they lost last night I was hoping to take them back to NJ this week. How awsome would that have been to bring them home with THE cup on the plane! Now that it isn't going to happen that way it is just as well we are not going out there. I guess they found some other charter FA's to handle it.  I am planning to go to Denver for the opening Bronco game on Mon. night Sept. 10th. We may have to have a reunion!

See attached file for proposed policy details. The cost for this policy (not to be revealed to Citizens) will be between $5,000 and $7,500 and will be paid for by ENA. ENA will enter into a side letter agreement with EAMR, which will provide for the insurance premium payment. Upon agreement with Citizens on the insurance policy details, EAMR is agreeable to executing a services agreement with Citizens, however, Citizens must agree to EAMR's indemnity and liability contract language as written in its original draft (see attached below).

"We actually use the same airplanes for both NBA and NHL. They were originally configured for the NBA then we added some hockey teams to our contract. There are 12 international first class seats and a table with four chairs in the front cabin, the middle has 2 tables with 4 chairs and an additional 4 world business class seats, then the back has 24 domestic first class seats and a sofa. They are old 727's that were reconfigured. Obviously, the NBA players sit in the front cabin since that was the idea of the 12 seats, and coaches in the middle with tables to work,  but the hockey players sit in the middle and back with coaches and staff occupying the front or middle. Each Hockey teams seating is different depending on the teams preference. Just to have a private flight makes the hockey guys happy. Most of them still remember when they had to fly commercial. They are not too picky. And with the steller service we provide, they don't even notice the decor!!!  Off to bang that little white ball around grass, sand and trees!

If covered by the policy, we will respond.  Losses, costs and expenses not recovered from the insurance, shall remain the obligation of Citizens.   Once again, if they agree to the limitation, the continued concerns would be: 1. The indemnity would be set aside by a court. 2.

Unbundling:  PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is  generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor  plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.     SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused  to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC  approval.   Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.   (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and  passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to  begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I  suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to  the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.  Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to  improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.   We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and  can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

"I am really only available Monday am (I am on a well-deserved vacation next week), but if that works for you, that would be great.  Jeff is pretty full up with the CA legislature and all the electric stuff.  We can try him, tho.  What I would like is to come up with a coherent message on hedging in CA, particularly the core-non-core issues, so that at the end of the day, EES still has a market and ENA can sell hedges to the LDCs.  Sue Landwehr in Gov Affairs is the leader/coordinator of our hedging activities before the state commissions and we should get her involved as well.  In fact I will cc both Sue and Jeff on this.   -----Original Message----- From:  Tycholiz, Barry   Sent: Friday, July 13, 2001 12:52 PM To: Lawner, Leslie Subject: RE: CA Instrate Gas matters  leslie, I would like to talk to you and jeff regarding ENA's plans to talking to the PUC regarding hedging activities... let's do this early next week.

Unbundling:  PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.     SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval.   Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.  Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.  (Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).",barry.tycholiz@enron.com,leslie.lawner@enron.com,RE: CA Instrate Gas matters,2001-07-13 16:30:00-07:00,received

I very much  require some assistance regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse and would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S. Taxes.

"Barry  Thanks for taking time Friday to meet with us......Sorry I missed you but I agree the meeting did go well.....I think you were successful in helping Michael Lynch over his hurdle concerning transport and gas supply which you rightfully point out are two distinct and separate issues.  I appreciate Stephanie Millers role in assisting our group in identifying obstacles and solutions in our development effort.  I hope you are not thinking of redirecting her.  She works well with our group.  With regard to Longview, lets coordinate the Gas Services Agreements through our development group.  I would prefer not to send McCook any further documentation until they have responded to our PSA and Management Agreements.  McCook is good at making us work and never responding. They owe us some Good Faith if you know what I mean.  I would appreciate it if you would continue to respond to McCooks questions about transport and supply...It sould like they need to get into an open season at the right time and you have a much better feel for that timing that I do.

I took off around 4:00 and assumed you were tied up with MCCook.  If you have time today, give me a call.  If there is any chance that these guys are going to buy the plant, then they really need to get into the open seasons with Williams and PGT.... timing is everything.   I also would like to discuss Stephanie Millers future role in the development game and would like your direct feedback.   Thanks for having us at the meeting, I thought it went OK, but there really were two seperate agenda's and they were as much concerned about the price of their gas as they were interested in how it is going to get to the plant... and as you know, one doesn't really have to do with the other.

I am a employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron Canada in Calgary.  As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any advise on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not sure what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse and would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S. Taxes.  Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going about this properly.  This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.  Thanks in advance.

I have attached an advanced draft agenda so you can see the line up of executives and topics. We certainly hope that Enron will agree to speak and sponsor....I would recommend the reception sponsorship....I believe a good value for the $.....see attached letter to David Fuller re sponsorship and Sponsorship Detail Sheet.   As you will see from the agenda, the topic is PRICE...natural gas price.....what I believe would be of interest is the relationship between gas and electric prices in the West....factoring hydro etc.,......identifying the wildcards....   The morning of Day 2 is high level - CEO discussions of DEMAND - consumer/industry/gas fired gen and PRICE...as I said Enron - as largest marketer in NA - should be the company delivering the discussion. - This is a GAS industry conference - not a ""public"" forum.

"John, I am pleased to report that West Gas Orig has completed the permanent assignment of approx 47,000 MMBtu/day of El Paso Transport to Public Service of New Mexico. This capacity was assigned with varying start dates. late 02 and early 03, with no credit risk associated with this transaction as a condition of the assignment was an unconditional release of ENA.  ENA assigned this capacity at max rate ( which meets all FERC policy issues)and we were able to generate $3.0 MM of incremental value which was granted to Stephanie Miller from Mike Grigsby.    In addition to the MTM of approx $ 3MM, this transaction reinforces the good working relationship between trading and marketing and may enhance ENA's trading position by removing some of the risks associated with this pipe. These risks include, flow rate risk, demand charge tariff changes, receipt point pool allocation risks, and potential MTM erosion and of course FERC/regulatory pressures.  Our work is nowhere near complete on this as we continue to create structures and discussion around the 200,000/day which is a little more complicated to shed. In the meantime our group continues to promote the placement of the remaining capacity either through other producers or generators and we anticipate the assignment of another  small package early next week.

"Further to our last group meeting.  I have discussed and reviewed the confirmation, deal ticket and data entry process with the appropriate parties and believe that the charts attached provide for a clear understanding of the process we all need to follow.  The transactions start with the originator  and most of the obligation is on you guys to follow up with the paper.  In order that we start to control the output on a more formal basis, we will start by asking to see all paper for deals greater than 31 days....All I am asking is that the confirms desk generate the paper as required, get a copy to the originator and the originator has a OBLIGATION to sign off or make appropriate changes as soon as possible.  The Denver office follows a slightly different procedure as you guys have Theresa to enter deals into Sitara and I know that this effort is coordinated with Carol.  Don't change a thing, just ensure you are comfortable with the paper flow and that if there are any holes that they are filled with a revised procedure.   Let's see how this process works and re-visit at the end of the year.  If there are any questions regarding this note, pls do not hesitate to contact me.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a ""Post Arrival Consultation""/PAC? This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect there are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and then there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the ""PAC"" - they simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Bearish fundamentals are triggered by last week's r= evised storage, mild weather and no tropical storm action on the immediate = horizon. Last week, the AGA revised the prior week's reported data up 47 Bc= f in addition to the higher than expect injection for the that week. The fa= lloff is in preparation for this week's expected much higher than normal.  = Most of New England and interior New York state will experience mild weathe= r this as will most of the Pacific coast.

"Well, we are having to sell it because we are so short of cash right now. Really for a lot of reasons. We have had to make an investment of our own to do a demo so we could shop it to labels in the U.S. This is working out well as we have had a few discussions already. Also there have been some serious changes in the way U.S. Immigration is working and it has really screwed a lot of touring bands. It has made us cancel already 10 shows for September. They basically changed the rules overnight on everybody. There is nothing we can do about it unless we know a member of Congress or we have a $1000 U.S.. We may have to come up with the $1000. We think that we may be able to book tours that will allow us to just rent a vehicle when we need one. That is what we are looking at right now.

There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures.   To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and ""Hot Button"" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.

The order is fairly terse, and just says ""and if it so recalled (by PG&E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&E  service territory upon 24 hours notice.""  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.  As to the ""traditional rate making"" valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.  We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment, but I would doubt it.  If your question relates to how PG&E is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense, perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out.      -----Original Message----- From:  Miller, Stephanie   Sent: Tuesday, September 04, 2001 8:17 AM To: Lawner, Leslie Subject: RE: June 11 order on Rehearing: RP00-241-000 and RP00-241-004  When is the 24 hour notice on re-recall effective - 24 hours from the day of recall (varies depending on term) or 24 hours before the recall is supposed to start?

Leslie Lawner from our gov affairs group had drafted comments for the meeting and attended as well.  During the discussion there was a question from one of the Commissioners to Sourthwest Gas asking why they were not looking into developing a gas storage site.  I believe that Leslie has been talking to Miguel in your group and that possibly there is a meeting set in the near future to discuss development of storage with Southwest Gas?  We have developed a good relationship with several of Governor Hull's staffers, one of whom was at the meeting.  He expressed to me later a strong interest in gas storage development and opined that more  gas storage could be very helpful to the region. It would be helpful for me if I could set up a call between you or whoever would be most knowledgeable on the development of gas storage in your group and the Governor's staffer (Craig Marks) so that he can get a sense of what the real financial/physical/regulatory issues are in such a development.  He has a close relationship with the ACC, and could very well be helpful in moving something forward if we had a strong interest in doing something to move gas storage development in Arizona.

We have a case before the Nevada PUC where SW Gas is trying to force transportation customers who return to sales service to sign up for a minimum term of 5 years and then to give one year's notice before they can return to transportation.  Some customers went back to sales because of delivery and pricing problems last winter, so it became an issue (although most of those customers only had to sign up for 1 year of sales).",barry.tycholiz@enron.com,m..tholt@enron.com,RE: Southwest Gas in Nevada,2001-09-10 05:21:02-07:00,received

There are a number of ongoing cases at the Commission addressing the limited capacity on the El Paso system, and its capacity-allocation procedures, the distributors pointed out.

Southwest Gas Corp. and the El Paso Municipal Customer Group said they were concerned the proposed increase in the lateral's capacity may ""adversely affect"" them and other customers because capacity on the South Mainline would be needed to move the additional export load.

In its application, El Paso asked FERC for the go-ahead to increase the maximum daily export capacity on the lateral by about one-third to 308 MMcf/d to correspond with the ""rapid development"" of the gas infrastructure in the northern Mexico state of Chihuahua.

Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 4:22 PM To: Whitt, Mark; Tycholiz, Barry Subject: RE: Crestone Restructure  Mark and Barry  I have talked to Crestone about backing us in a Northern Border transportation deal.  Basically they are on board, however I have not shown them any economics.  What I believe needs to take place is to identify Northern Border shippers who would be willing to release their capacity.  Once we are able to put the capacity release economics together, which will be driven by the Northern Border shippers, we will be able to  show Crestone a deal.  I do not have any potential parties willing to release Northern Border capacity.  I have talked to the Central desk about this opportunity, they informed me that they had no interest in this type of an arrangement.  I personally believe we can manage ENA's current Northern Border position more efficiently but have been unable to convince others of this.  Any ideas you can provide would be helpful.

In review of the past two rate case settlements of Williston Basin (WBI= ) I found no such provisions.  In its current rate case proceeding before F= ERC a limited settlement was reached which dealt primarily with net plant a= nd labor costs.  A hearing was held on all remaining issues and is currentl= y in the briefing stage.  Neither in the limited settlement, nor in the hea= ring was disposition of base gas revenues addressed.  However, the reorganizational settlement that conveyed facilities from MDU = to WBI may be a factor.  As a result of restructuring under 636 WBI was obl= igated to sell certain excess volumes of company owned working gas (priced = at $.47 /mcf) to its customers.  WBI proposed to sell the gas at market and=  retain any profits.  As mentioned in the LeBeoeuf, Lamb memo the Commissio= n addressed this issues several times, reversing itself in the process, and=  finally ordered that WBI must sell the working gas at cost.  Though not re= lying entirely on the reorganizational settlement, throughout the various o= rders, the Commission referenced the 1985 reorganizational settlement as re= quiring any gains on the sale of working gas to be flowed through to WBI cu= stomers.  WBI sought rehearing, arguing that the Commission was taking a ve= ry broad interpretation of the settlement.  The Commission raised the issue=  again in its order on rehearing, among other things, and WBI didn't seek r= ehearing or pursue that particular argument further, which the Commission p= oints out in its final order.  As LeBeoeuf Lamb asserts, the environment (Order 636 restructuring) in whic= h the Commission ordered flow-through of profits on the sale of storage vol= umes has changed and those arguments may not be applicable anymore.  But, t= he reorganizational settlement might be something to take into account and = should be discussed with WBI.  Just something to be aware of.  If you have any questions please call.

"Lorelie, attached is a Price Distribution table that is set up as a template for SPPC Power load as it relates to market prices  and load.  As you can see, this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down.  The distribution ( fixed price vs floating ) may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today ( relative to the historical numbers) but those iterations can be made as required.  Pls review and we can discuss at your convenience.  Also, as discussed, I am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult.  With that being said however, I do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ENA and SPPC are both protected and I would like to pursue this with you. One area that I would like to start with to have SPPC sell ENA physical gas ( 30,000/40,000/day) against a physical gas daily related price.  Once I have accumulated a payables position, we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts/paper currently in place.  I am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest.  regards,   Barry Tycholiz   -----Original Message----- From: Bronstein, Mara  Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 9:25 AM To: Tycholiz, Barry Subject: SPPC1.xls    ",lreid@sppc.com,barry.tycholiz@enron.com,FW: SPPC1.xls,2001-10-19 08:04:27-07:00,sent

Cc: Tycholiz, Barry; Bump, Dan J. Subject: Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project   ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.    As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.  There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.  These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:  1.  Power Marketing and Project development 2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access 3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise  Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.  Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.  Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Subject: Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project   ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.    As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.  There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.  These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:  1.  Power Marketing and Project development 2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access 3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise  Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.  Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.  Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.  Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.  Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.     There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.   Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.  Louise & John",barry.tycholiz@enron.com,f..calger@enron.com,FW: Natural Gas Origination,2001-10-24 20:31:39-07:00,received

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.  Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.  Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.     There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.   Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.  Louise & John",f..calger@enron.com,barry.tycholiz@enron.com,RE: Natural Gas Origination,2001-10-25 05:29:33-07:00,sent

"Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings By MARK GOLDEN, KRISTEN MCNAMARA, JON KAMP and JOHN EDMISTON    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK -- Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the companies said Thursday. The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week. ""We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,"" said John Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). ""It's business as usual."" Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action. ""Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"" said Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't expect to make any drastic changes. Like many utilities, the Public Service Co. of New Mexico (PNM) is ""monitoring the situation."" So is Aquila, said Mark Gurley, general manager of trading at the company. ""We haven't altered our credit policy at all,"" Gurley said. But if Enron's credit rating slips, ""our tolerances for risk with them would go down,"" he said. A trading manager for another energy company said that all energy and financial companies that have dealings with Enron are assessing their exposure. But that manager's company has made no changes and doesn't expect Enron to have cash liquidity problems. One large firm has been limiting the credit it extends to Enron for the past month. A gas trader with another firm has been encouraged to do more business on other energy trading platforms like the InterContinental Exchange. Enron, however, is far too big to cut off entirely, traders said. Energy trading companies depend on Enron as the major market maker for their commodities. Enron built the over-the-counter wholesale gas marketplace, and more recently its two-year-old electronic trading platform, EnronOnline, has become a major marketplace for gas and power, accounting for 25% of those markets, according to one recent estimate.    Enron is the counterparty to every trade on the system.   EnronOnline grew so quickly because of the company's policy that traders must offer aggressive two-way spreads - both bids and offers - on the commodities they trade. Any reduction in EnronOnline volumes could translate to an immediate liquidity problem for North American power markets. ""If there is a problem with Enron, there's going to be domino effect through the industry,"" Tractebel's Kinner said. Uncertainties about Enron's financial situation have aggravated the volatility of gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a trader said. Gas and power traders said that Enron traders are moving to liquidate some positions and, because the company's problems are well known, it is getting squeezed in the market, which would discount the return on positive positions. Enron traders have few outstanding favors to call on with counterparties, because Enron traders have been so aggressive over the years, the trading manager said. Analysts have raised questions about Enron's difficulties on a number of conference calls held by other energy companies to discuss their quarterly earnings reports. One of those companies, Sempra Energy (SRE), said it was monitoring the situation but saw little risk so far. ""At this point, there's no reason for concern,"" Sempra spokesman Doug Kline said. ""We continue to trade with them, and they're covering their margins."" -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com",barry.tycholiz@enron.com,tyrell.harrison@enron.com,WSJ Article,2001-10-25 13:42:14-07:00,received

Right now the SCE QFs are negotiating with SCE on 2 major points:  when will they be paid for the outstanding receivables (est. at $1.3 B for SCE and about $1.0 B for PG&E)  and when will the 5 yr fixed price SRAC of 5.37 cents/kw apply for those that have selected this option.  Right now SCE appears to be indicating that they will be paying the receivable sometime around June/July of 2002 and that the 5.37 price would apply at that time or as much as 4 months after that.  The logic is that they are trying to indicate that the MOU, if it had been passed, would not have applied at least until that time.

"Barry,  Generally, the seller of an option does NOT incur taxable income on the receipt of an option premium.  Instead, the option premium is held as an ""open transaction"" (ie. no current tax consequences) until the option is exercised, sold/terminated in a closing transaction, or lapses.  Similarly, the purchaser of an option does not get an immediate tax deduction when it pays an option premium.    The ultimate tax impact to the option seller and purchaser depends on what happens with the underlying option.  For example, if the option is exercised, then the option seller adds the option premium to the strike price to determine the total amount realized on the sale of the underlying commodity.  (This total amount realized is then used to determine whether the seller has taxable gain or loss on the underlying sale).  From the option purchaser's perspective, the option premium is added to the strike price to determine its tax basis in the underlying commodity.  In the case where the option is allowed to lapse, the option seller treats the option premium as taxable income on the date that the option lapses.  Similarly, the option purchaser takes a deduction for the option premium on the date that the option lapses.  Hopefully this gives you a little bit of an overview of the general rules governing the taxation of options.  Notwithstanding the above overview, I would still like to visit with you regarding the proposed transaction as there are certain ""exceptions"" or ""nuances"" to the general rules that could apply.  As such, once you have had a chance to review, please give me a call at ext. 3-5846 so that we can discuss further.  Thanks.

"I had not heard that there was a discussion today. However, since we ran the economics for Huber and discovered that Enron's books do not appropriately value the Permian capacity, we have been trying to convince BP that the value of the capacity is greater than the basis spread becase of the optionality associated with the variable costs of fuel and commodity.  We used to have a model that the transport group used to use to value that optionality based upon the volatility of the basis spreads and the variable costs.  Steph and Phil are running numbers to determine Enron's ""extrinsic value"".  We need to discuss how and what information we share with BP in order to convince them that the capacity is worth more than the value than that the  outright basis markets .    -----Original Message----- From:  Tycholiz, Barry   Sent: Wednesday, October 31, 2001 2:19 PM To: Whitt, Mark Subject: RE: EPNG Proposal II  that was today...

Subject: Key Enron Employees Aren't Jumping Ship, Recruiters Say  10/31/2001 16:33:09 Key Enron Employees Aren't Jumping Ship, Recruiters Say Dow Jones International News Service via Dow Jones By Michael Rieke Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) current problems aren't sending its key employees running for the door, according to two executive recruiters. While employees at Enron's underperforming units are shopping around for new jobs, those working for its core wholesale energy trading and retail energy units seem content, the recruiters told Dow Jones Newswires. ""We've been getting resumes from their international group over the last year,"" said Bruce Peterson, managing director for Korn Ferry in Houston. ""But its been a very well-known fact that they're getting out of those businesses."" Another Houston recruiter, who didn't want to be identified, said he has gotten ""a flood"" of resumes from employees at Enron's natural gas and power assets in South America. Employees at Enron's broadband unit are also sending out resumes, said the recruiter. That business has brought the company losses of more than $100 million this year despite hundreds of layoffs. Enron continues to cut costs in its telecom business. Neither recruiter has seen many resumes from Enron's big moneymakers - the wholesale energy trading group and the retail energy services group. Some of the lower-level employees of those units have sent out resumes but Peterson said he hasn't seen higher-level executives in the job market. However, he attached a caveat to that statement. ""Quite a few of the senior people at Enron have left over the last 6-12 months,"" he said. When Enron's share price was flying high last year and early this year, some of Enron's top executives cashed out their stock options and left the company. Those executives included Cliff Baxter, former vice chairman and chief strategy officer; Ken Rice, former head of Enron Capital and Trade as well as former chief executive of Enron Broadband Services; Kevin Hannon, former president of Enron Broadband Services; and Lou Pai, former chairman and chief executive of Enron Energy Services. The lure of cashing out lucrative stock options won't cost Enron any more employees any time soon. The company's share price has fallen too far too quickly, leaving the options underwater. The company's shares traded as high as $80 early this year. By July the price had dropped to around $50, leaving employees with options that were virtually worthless. So Enron told employees it would issue new options in August. But the company's share price continued to fall as more and more bad news came out. The new options issued in August, when the share prices were around $40, are now underwater also. Now that the options are out of the money, Enron employees are more vulnerable to the lure of other companies, Peterson said. Enron could face another problem in keeping key people. Its employees work under two-year contracts. If they leave Enron before their contracts expires, a noncompete clause could prevent them for working for a competitor. Some of those contracts will expire at the end of the year. Without the incentive of lucrative stock options, Enron might have a difficult time getting employees to agree to new contracts with a noncompete clause, Peterson said. An Enron spokeswoman said the company isn't planning to issue more new options to employees. -By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; michael.rieke@dowjones.com   Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones and Company, Inc.

FYI   -----Original Message----- From:  Lynn, Derek   Sent: Wednesday, October 31, 2001 11:48 AM To: Oh, Grant Subject: ENE comps  Grant, ENE trades at 7x 2001 expected recurring earnings and 0.9 times book value.  This is far lower than a quick industry average of 15.5 times 2001 expected earnings and 2.8 times current book value (industry includes Duke, EL Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan, and Aquila).  I think what these ratios demonstrate is the risk of the unknown that is being priced into ENE.  For example the current price to book seems like a suspect ratio to use for ENE given that it is unclear what is on our books and what else needs to be written down.  If you look at ENE on a price to earnings after non-recurring items for 2001 it looks far less attractive at 22.9 times.  If you take ENE's earnings after ""non-recurring"" items and slap on the industry average multiple of 15.5 times ENE's share price is $8.51 (ouch).  Now obviously not everything in the non-recurring events are actually recurring but there is talk of some wholesale losses being buried in the ""non-recurring"" loss.  ENE's long-term debt to equity is 0.9 times but if you include all the off balance sheet leverage and the leverage inherent in our trading business the true number is significantly higher than 0.9 times.  On a positive note the ENE's debt is trading higher today (price not yield).  Here is a spreadsheet from Bloomberg with the S&P pipelines sub sector P/Es, and P/Bs. and dividend per share (ENE's is 4%, nothing like a share price falling by 85% to get that div yield up).  I have also attached the latest Wall Street Journal article touting Berkshire, Royal Dutch, and GE as potential suitors (do you think Buffet can understand ENE?).

FYI   -----Original Message----- From:  Lynn, Derek   Sent: Wednesday, October 31, 2001 11:48 AM To: Oh, Grant Subject: ENE comps  Grant, ENE trades at 7x 2001 expected recurring earnings and 0.9 times book value.  This is far lower than a quick industry average of 15.5 times 2001 expected earnings and 2.8 times current book value (industry includes Duke, EL Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan, and Aquila).  I think what these ratios demonstrate is the risk of the unknown that is being priced into ENE.  For example the current price to book seems like a suspect ratio to use for ENE given that it is unclear what is on our books and what else needs to be written down.  If you look at ENE on a price to earnings after non-recurring items for 2001 it looks far less attractive at 22.9 times.  If you take ENE's earnings after ""non-recurring"" items and slap on the industry average multiple of 15.5 times ENE's share price is $8.51 (ouch).  Now obviously not everything in the non-recurring events are actually recurring but there is talk of some wholesale losses being buried in the ""non-recurring"" loss.  ENE's long-term debt to equity is 0.9 times but if you include all the off balance sheet leverage and the leverage inherent in our trading business the true number is significantly higher than 0.9 times.  On a positive note the ENE's debt is trading higher today (price not yield).  Here is a spreadsheet from Bloomberg with the S&P pipelines sub sector P/Es, and P/Bs. and dividend per share (ENE's is 4%, nothing like a share price falling by 85% to get that div yield up).  I have also attached the latest Wall Street Journal article touting Berkshire, Royal Dutch, and GE as potential suitors (do you think Buffet can understand ENE?).

"Barry,  In spite of the news in the media about Enron, I see opportunity. Since we've communicated last I've been real busy selling my services to major energy traders. Actually Enron is one of the traders that have my company listed as one of three or four minority businesses that will be involved with supplying the power for contracts. These contracts start at $100,000,000 and go up.  Barry, I'm going to forge ahead, but I'd still rather have the opportunity to work and learn from the biggest and best. One of my strong points is to get the deal done, another is to understand my limitations. If you give me the shot on the origination side you'd be most pleased. If I can convince the world's largest energy trader to put me on their contracts and RFPs after being in business for less than a year, just think what could be done with a supportive back office and timely information.  What I'm seeking is a chance to excel with all the tools at my disposal. Drop me a email and tell me your thoughts.

I am interested in further exploring the discounted transportation/ supply program we briefly discussed at this week's meeting.

Additionally, please be advised that DWR would be contemplating relatively short term transactions with Enron at this time. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

As for the payables, DWR is following standard payment terms; the latter of 10 days after receipt of invoice or the 25th of the month following delivery. DWR would not agree to accelerating payments.

I would like to take the next step with them and assuming we get paper executed for ECC and ENA ( which is pending).... I want to give them TRADE ACCESS TO EOL.    Cumulative unsecured exposure would be about $300,000/day. ( estimated ) and  I would try to get the payments from them to us made on the 5th business day vs the 25th business day following delivery. Our master will give us rights for reasonable financial assurances but not definative collateral threshold amount, infact we should keep this at zero for both sides until the air clears.   All transactions will come through EOL and the products being sold by ENA, ECC will be cash or rest of month, AECO, Sumas, Malin or PG&E Citygate.  The bottom line on this is do we want to enter into Gas related cash transactions that increase of exposure on a receivables basis to PG&E.  Commercially, I believe they are someone we want to do business with and we can increase deal flow on EOL for some Canadian and U.S. products.

Full report on the meeting is attached, here is a summary of the main points:  They do not object to the development of an LNG terminal by Enron on the Columbia river or to Enron's efforts to negotiate a land lease option at Port Westward.  Their pipeline system is not set up to take advantage of the regasified LNG to supply their core customers in Portland but they would consider buying directly from us for customers in the Port Westward, St. Helens, Longview area if the price was right, i.e., the lower of Sumas and Stanfield price MINUS some discount from the NW Pipeline postage stamp tariff. They perceive some risk in relying on an LNG supply with price formula linked to Nymex that would not provide a floor for the LNG producer. They would like to see the LNG terminal in southern Oregon, where the NW pipeline system telescopes down to 10 inches, but realize that the terminal would be lost somewhere around Coos Bay with over 150 miles to go to connect with the PGT line across the Coastal Range and the Cascades, through an area of strong environmental concerns. At this point, the best option for Enron seems to be (pending positive report on navigational issues on the Columbia from Golder):  a terminal close to the N/W Pipeline in the Port Westward/Longview area selling gas directly to local customers (i.e., bypassing NW P/L transportation charges) selling rest of gas on NW P//L Eventually, we will need to talk to the Kelso Beaver (KB) Pipeline which operates the small diameter line to Port Westward.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Note that even the Commission decision overturning the ALJ's rejection of roll-in dates back to early 1999.  The 1999 Policy Statement was not issued until September 1999.         Procedural History            This proceeding arises from two general section 4 rate cases      filed by Transco in Docket Nos. RP95-197-000 and RP97-71-000.       Those cases have a long and complicated history which need not be      repeated here.4/  A controversial issue in these proceedings has      been whether the costs of Transco's twelve incrementally-priced      Leidy and Southern expansion projects should be rolled into      Transco's system-wide rates.                On April 16, 1999, the Commission issued an order5/      reversing the ALJ's rejection of Transco's proposal to roll in      the costs of the twelve projects.  The Commission held that, in      determining whether Transco and the proponents of rolled-in rates      had met their section 4 burden, the Commission would apply its      1995 Pricing Policy Statement, 6/ which was issued one year after      the last of the projects at issue here was certificated and      built.  The Commission concluded that Transco had satisfied the      conditions in the 1995 Pricing Policy Statement for rolling in      expansion costs.    -----Original Message----- From:  Miller, Stephanie   Sent: Friday, November 09, 2001 8:40 AM To: Cantrell, Rebecca W.

Sent: Thursday, November 08, 2001 3:05 PM To: Miller, Stephanie Cc: Tycholiz, Barry; Steffes, James D.; Lawner, Leslie Subject: RE: PGT Fuel Treatment  Stephanie:  Confirming our phone conversation today, based on my reading of the Transco order and the PGT order, the FERC relied on a different standard in the Transco case (the 1995 Pricing Policy Statement) than they used in the PGT case (the 1999 Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities).    The 1995 Policy Statement said that, when the roll-in increased rates to existing shippers by less than 5%, the pipeline needed to make only a general showing of system benefits, and FERC said that Transco had satisfied that showing.    The 1999 Policy Statement, however, has a threshold requirement for expansion projects requiring that there can be no subsidization from existing customers - in other words, no increase in costs of any kind.  The PGT order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs could increase for existing shippers; therefore, PGT had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that would apply absent the new compression.  If the fuel costs do not increase, then there will be no surcharge.   -----Original Message----- From:  Miller, Stephanie   Sent: Monday, November 05, 2001 2:12 PM To: Cantrell, Rebecca W.

Based upon a recent FERC ruling on the treatment of fuel on a project on Transco's Leidy Lateral (last 2 weeks), PGT is going to ask FERC to reverse its ruling on the 2002 expansion. If you remember, FERC was very clear on the notion that existing shippers should not subsidize increased costs associated with incremental shippers. I've been told that Transco received approval for rolled in treatment of higher fuel because they did not have an ""incremental"" tariff.    This sounds very suspicious - can you please investigate?

Male Maturity  When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.  When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I needed a passionate girl with a zest for life.  In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency; she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.  So I decided I needed a girl with stability.  When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I needed a girl with some excitement.  When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless.  So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.  When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground and married her.  She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.  Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits. *******************Internet Email Confidentiality Footer*******************   Privileged/Confidential Information may be contained in this message.

Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.  The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.  We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.   In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

"Hi Mr. Tycholiz,  My name is Tamara and I work with Judy on the Enron program here at PricewaterhouseCoopers.  I have been looking over your file and have a question with regard to the fax which you sent to us on August 29, 2001. There may have been a misunderstanding regarding the intention of you faxing those documents to us.  We looked at the fax and understood it to be for our files.  However, from your most recent email, we are now thinking that you had expected us to take some kind of action on your behalf with the IRS.  The original notice from the IRS is dated June 23rd, 2001.  It states that should you not agree with their figures, you should contact them.  We assumed that you did not agree with the notice and had contacted them.  Our question is: did you contact the IRS and/or send in the forms with your wife's SSN or was it action that we were meant to take?  If you could please clarify this at your earliest convenience, we will try to get this resolved as soon as possible.  Kind regards,  Tamara L.

"Here it is.   -----Original Message----- From: =09Johnston, Greg =20 Sent:=09Wednesday, November 07, 2001 9:48 AM To:=09Le Dain, Eric Subject:=09One Way vs. Two Way Payments  I have reviewed the master physical gas agreements for the 10 counterpartie= s (excluding trading companies) at the top of the exposure list to determin= e whether the contracts contemplate one-way or two-way payments.  1.  Petro Canada Oil & Gas - One Way 2.  Canadian Natural Resources - Two Way 3.  Marathon Canada Limited - One Way 4.  Husky Oil Operations Limited - One Way 5.  Murphy Canada Exploration Company - One Way 6.  Encal Energy Ltd. - One Way 7.  Talisman Energy Inc. - One Way 8.  Premstar Energy Canada Ltd. - Two Way 9.  Rio Alto Exploration Ltd. - One Way 10.  Sunoco Inc. - Two Way  The basic operation of a one way payment provision is that, if the defaulti= ng party has a net in-the-money position based upon the Early Termination D= amages calculation, the Early Termination Damages are deemed to be zero and=  the non-defaulting party is not required to pay that amount to the default= ing party (the defaulting party's position is wiped out).  However, we woul= d still be entitled, prior to default, to call for collateral where a count= erparty's out-of-the money position is in excess of its collateral threshol= d, which would provide us with security to ensure the counterparty continue= s to pay.  In addition, if the counterparty failed to post such collateral,=  they would be in default, we could terminate the contract and, as the non-= defaulting party, we would be in a position to realize on our in-the-money = position.  If, after we received the collateral, we were then to become ins= olvent or otherwise default under the master, the counterparty could termin= ate the contract, our mark-to-market position would be wiped out and we wou= ld be required to return any unused collateral.  The operation of a two way payment provision is that the early termination = damages are calculated by the non-defaulting party and whoever has a net in= -the-money position based upon such calculation is owed the termination pay= ment, regardless of whether such party is the defaulting or non-defaulting = party.  In other words, unlike a one way payment, if the defaulting party h= as a net in-the-money position upon termination of the contract, the non-de= faulting party will be required to pay that amount to the defaulting party.=   Therefore, if we were to become insolvent or otherwise default under a ma= ster and we had a net in-the-money position under that master, the counterp= arty could terminate the contract but we would still be owed our mark-to-ma= rket position.  The other point to consider in the situation where there is=  a two way payment provision is that, of the three counterparty masters abo= ve that contain two way payments, all three also contain cherry picking lan= guage that, upon the occurrence of an event of default other than insolvenc= y, allows the non-defaulting counterparty to pick and choose which transact= ions to terminate.  In other words, the counterparty need not terminate all=  transactions, which could effect the amount otherwise owed to the defaulti= ng party.  Even with cherry-picking, upon the occurrence of an insolvency, = all transactions are deemed to terminate, so cherry picking would not be a = factor.  You had also asked whether the failure by a party to call for collateral wh= en it is entitled to under a contract would have an impact on the ability o= f such party to collect on a termination payment owed to it upon terminatio= n of the contract.  Other than the fact that the failure to call for collat= eral may mean that we do not hold credit support that would be usable to of= fset a termination payment owing if the party obligated to pay fails to pay= , the right to call for collateral is just that, a right and not an obligat= ion, and the failure to call for collateral does not colour the right of th= e party owed the termination payment to require it be paid.  Let me know if you need anything further with respect to this matter.  Greg",barry.tycholiz@enron.com,eric.le@enron.com,FW: One Way vs. Two Way Payments,2001-11-28 07:39:13-08:00,received

SO, I told him to review  the tariff and make a determination as to whether or not it is still ours to use, if it isn't, then we don't really need to talk.. it they determine it is still ours, then we need to think about what the estate should do with it, including the upstream parts.

Most pressing is PGT's request to market capacity on our behalf. Although I do not believe we need to have PGT perform this function, I do believe we could mitigate some demand charge exposure for ""the estate"".    Are you available to meet with Barry and I first thing tomorrow morning? We need to have an answer for PGT's request. We need to know what the contractual rights are for 1) the pipeline when a shipper declares bankruptcy and 2) our ability to mitigate demand charge exposure by releasing capacity on a short term basis (month at a time?).  Better yet, can we unilaterally turn capacity back to any of these pipes or do we need to reach some type of court approved settlement?  Obviously, we have many questions.
