As background, I have been at EECC since  October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint  venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing  agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic  investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston  office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where  I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on  their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and  CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP  projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in  Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions  such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work,  partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your  consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from  vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

The  Directors and officers of Argentine companies have joint and several  liability to the shareholders and third parties for their acts as directors  and officers and therefore what often happens is that the companies agree to  indemnify them as long as they are acting within their scope of employment.   I have created this form out of several documents I have run across and  wanted to know if it looks reasonable.  I will also check into whether it  needs to be approved by the shareholders and whether an Argentine company can  even agree to indemnify its directors and officers in advance of any action.

"Mark,  As you requested, below is a list of my major accomplishments for the year.    1. Resolution/management of pre-litigation and litigation matters,  including:  Dwayne Hart/Utilicorp; Satterwhite; Barrington; Race/Statoil;  Ross Malme; Rick Blandford; West Boettcher; Anita Suson; Charlie Weymms;  Steven Cuneo; others.  2.  Efficient management of drafting, negotiating, revising, and completing  several types of contracts in numerous different jurisdictions (e.g., almost  200 employment agreements, 35 separation agreements, and 30 consulting  services agreements).  3. Lead attorney on Project One (which involves issues surrounding the  OFCCP's ""glass ceiling"" audit of ENA and all of Enron).  4. Labor and employment transactional support, including:  East Coast Power,  Ecogas, CGas, Project Hurricane, Columbia, Project Grizzly, Las Vegas Cogen,  and other acquisitions that involve the transfer or hiring of personnel. Many  of these transactions require extensive legal support relating to personnel  matters after closing.  5. Legal support on labor (union) matters, including successful closing of  project labor agreements for the construction of generation assets (e.g.,  Pittsburg, 2000 peakers, Pastoria), Unfair Labor Practice matters, training  on union-related issues in M&A's.

For some,  it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain  retirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash  balance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the  fact they will return to their home country to retire.  If they remain on  their home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method  to have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well  as receive US $.  Currently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.  He is paid by the UK a  portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.  The remainder of his salary is  paid on US payroll.  This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.  No  FICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.   Unfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as  they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars,  health/welfare and retirement benefits.  We indicated in his employment  agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.  I am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.  Would it be  possible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign  nationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a  mechanism to:  receive a portion of their pay in US $ into a US account pay in FIT and possibly FICA/Medicare not make them eligible for domestic benefits  I would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this.

Once we know there are no  DOL/ERISA issues (or at least some we can manage), we can set-out the process  flow and then the companies.  I'll coordinate a conference call -- but let's  do this after the holidays.  So many of the players are not here at the same  time and I am sure payroll has as many year end issues as we do right now.  (Sheri, please contact Michelle Cash and Pat Mackin to get available dates  and then set-up a conference call including the above people as well as Mikie  Rath and Dolores Lenfest.  We probably need to do this as soon as possible in  the new year.  Can you also include Jane Pleli, Joann Hill and Sherry  Lessner, there may be issues with us changing current environment prior to  7/1/2000 that we need to consider.)

As Cynthia states below, the  new company (as a whole) would not be adopting benefit plans.  Logistically,  there would just need to be different procedures for setting up the new hires  on the correct company.  Also, the administration of the cross charges will be much easier once SAP  Payroll comes online 7/1.  Currently, there is some manual intervention when  charging from one company (like Expat Services) to the appropriate accounting  company.

The new payroll  company will simply not adopt the plans.  I am assuming that the number of  employees (nor associated demographics) in this company will not create a  discrimination problem.      One question though, will we treat all foreign nationals the same or will you  want to pick and choose who receive domestic benefits and who does not.  If  the answer is yes to this we will probably need to run some legal traps.  Let me know if we can help.

For some,  it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain  retirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash  balance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the  fact they will return to their home country to retire.  If they remain on  their home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method  to have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well  as receive US $.  Currently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.  He is paid by the UK a  portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.  The remainder of his salary is  paid on US payroll.  This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.  No  FICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.   Unfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as  they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars,  health/welfare and retirement benefits.  We indicated in his employment  agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.  I am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.  Would it be  possible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign  nationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a  mechanism to:  receive a portion of their pay in US $ into a US account pay in FIT and possibly FICA/Medicare not make them eligible for domestic benefits  I would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this.

We will approach  this in three phases as below:  Phase I - On our payroll system - do we have employees in the correct  companies in EPC and do we know which ones are wholly owned by Enron;  Phase II - Not on our payroll but in the U.S. -  do we know who the employees  are, what companies they work for and how our ownership is structured;    Phase III - Not on our payroll and outside the U.S. - do we know who the  employees are, what companies they work for and how our ownership is    structured.   I will have some preliminary work completed and would like to review it at  that time.

"David,  As we discussed, Mark Haedicke and I discussed the possibility of providing  Kevin McConville with some sort of indemnity in order to make sure that he  remains available and cooperative during the pendency of the NSM case and  other litigation matters.  We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin.  The  terms of that Agreement would include:  1. He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel  regarding litigation matters.  He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare  for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as  needed.  2. Through February 1, 2001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this  cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to  the terms of his employment agreement).  After Feb.1, 2001, he will be paid a  rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard.  3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary  course and scope of his employment with Enron, up to the last date of his  employment with Enron.  Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or  claims based upon the following:    -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment,    -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA,   -- Kevin's intentional acts,    -- Kevin's gross negligence,   -- Kevin's reckless conduct,   -- conduct that is in violation of any law, statute, regulation, or other  legal obligation, or    -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act.  4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after  2/1/01.  The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt.  In addition,  all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of  the  agreement.  Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.  I  am available to participate in your call with him, if you would like me to  attend.

"Ok, you told me nothing, so I am clueless as to what is creating the  distress.  Maybe we can chat later.  We will not be in Austin in the next few months.  We are going to San Antonio  the first weekend in March, as well as the first week in April.  The first  trip is for a wedding between two friends of Trey from Rice MBA who are  marrying each other.  The other is for the Enron law conference, which is  Wed.-Friday.  We are not taking Cameron on either of those trips (party  time!!), so we will be rushing back to Houston right afterwards.  I am working with Butch Hayes at F&J.  I haven't been too involved in the  matter because it is not an Enron subsidiary, but from what I can tell, I  like him.  Any additional insight, if necessary, would be great.  Too bad you weren't in Houston a couple of weeks ago.  But, it probably would  have been a sad time for all of you, and it sounds like you don't really need  that right now.  If you visit us, we promise to be cheerful and frivolous if  you need it -- not that acting that way is too much of a chore for me.  Plus,  Cameron acts like a 2-year-old, which is a delight.  He started at a new  school a few weeks ago (The Post Oak School -- a Montessori school about a  block from our house), and he is really coming into his own.  It is amazing  how much my world has both grown and shrunk since he was born.  Little things  like seeing a squirrel in the back yard have become major events (don't even  get me started on helicopters).  On the other hand, I feel this enormous  responsibility and desire to make sure that all is right with the world.   Quite an awesome sense of obligation and discovery combined.    Enough waxing philosophical.  I've got to get out of here at some point, so  I'd better get back to work.  Later.

Yes, January was a tough month, and I guess I got pretty distracted by it all. Nothing has been resolved but I've gotten over the initial shock and sadness for my brothers. We were pretty worried about Joe for a while there because Myra is (was?) the love of his life and he is so vulnerable. I can't remember how much I told you over the phone (?)  Good to hear from you! We haven't been to Houston in a long time and are due for a visit. We almost came the weekend of Feb 5-6 because a group was getting together to go to Jay's gravesite in honor of his Feb 10th birthday. (But work kept me here that weekend.) Hopefully sometime soon I can get over there and see you & Trey & Cameron. Any plans to come this way? I'd love to see you.  For V-Day, we went out to eat at the Hula Hut. I picked up my brother Ed from the airport (he had been in Santa Fe with Joe for a long weekend - we are taking turns) and Ed came with us for our nice ""romantic"" dinner. Later Rog and I went for coffee and dessert as a special treat. We still have a great time together just talking about stuff and catching up on the day's happenings.  Hope all is going well with the investigation - it sounded like you were in good hands with the Fulbright lawyer. (Who is it? - Brian Grieg? Butch Hayes?) If I can be of any help in any way, please let me know - I would love to work with you!

It sounded like you were a bit on the stressed out side.  I hope things have improved, and that you had a nice, romantic Valentine's Day yesterday.  Trey and I went to the opera on Sat. night for our V-Day event.  We saw the Elixer of Love, which is a very light, cute, happy-ending opera (no screeching).  I think we got the referrals taken care of on the Austin investigator issue. Thanks for your input.  Take care, and I'll catch you later.

Deferral Plan   Michelle, Carol Jewett called me this morning about including a provision i= n the long term incentive plan (""LTIP"") being established for Enron Investmen= t Partners (old Enron Development Corp.) to permit deferral of payouts under the Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.  I suggested to Carol that such a provision in the LTIP would not be appropriate or sufficient; that the tail cannot wag the dog.  If such deferrals are to be permitted, they would have to be authorized and made under the provisions of the Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.  Also, there are som= e additional issues discussed below.  Any compensatory arrangement that by design or practice defers payment of t= he benefit until or beyond termination of an employee=01,s employment is consi= dered to be a ""pension plan"" under ERISA.  ERISA contains complex and challenging administrative, participation and funding requirements  (which most employers want to avoid) for such non-tax qualified pension plans.  The way to avoid these requirements is to design such a compensatory program, such as a deferral plan, so that it is a ""top hat"" plan which is exempt, not from ERISA, but from the more onerous requirements.  For example, only employees who meet the ""top hat"" definition are permitted to participate in the Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.  Enron Corp. is not willin= g to let all employees who participate in the LTIP make deferrals to the Enro= n Corp. Deferral Plan.  Any participant in the LTIP who wants to defer a payo= ut must first pass the screening test for top hat employees applied by Enron Corp. Compensation and then make the deferral election on an approved form. Also, any such employee must become an employee of Enron Corp. and then reassigned or seconded to work for Enron Investment Partners.  This employment requirement is to avoid multiple employer problems related to th= e Enron Corp. Deferral Plan and its related trust.  Michelle, it may be ""better, faster, simpler"" to include a deferral feature in the LTIP.  The same ERISA issues are present, but Enron Investment Partners is in control.  Regardless, let=01,s discuss the design for the deferrals at your convenien= ce.   Pat  ",jkwilson@velaw.com,michelle.cash@enron.com,Deferral of Payouts under LTIP,2000-04-03 04:46:00-07:00,sent

You should have received these awhile ago. We had a virus shutdown, but I cannot think of any other reason why you do not have these. Let me state what I attempted to state in my last message:       1) As to the Data Protection Agreements, we contemplate that an Exhibit C will be attached that will describe the non-exclusive types of information that will be personal data. For your information I am resending the ""annotated"" version of this agreement to describe the significance of the removal of brackets. We also added a section 3.g to allow additions to the purposes for collection. As the regulators in the EU become more refined in their analysis and requirements as to the statement of purpose, you might need to alter purposes.       2) As to the Policy itself, we inserted a line that dates the revision of the policy, and we added a provision in Section 2 corresponding to the change in Section 3.g mentioned above.

"Felicia,  In general, you are correct that the salary basis test must be met before  someone can be classified as exempt.  However, because there are certain  exceptions to the salary basis test (for example, licensed attorneys do not  have to meet that test), it depends on what the employees are doing as to  whether this situation creates a problem under the FLSA.  My recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by  these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue.  If  they do not fit within one of the exceptions, we probably should have them  affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the  overtime rate. You would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the  overtime rate.  If they are not working over 40 hours in a week, it will not  be an issue.  Let me know if you have questions.

Unless I understand  the FLSA incorrectly we cannot in any way calculate salaries on exempt  employees on an hourly basis.  If they are reduced hours we would need to  determine how we would value their job based on a salary basis otherwise we  are treating them as hourly employees and not exempt employees.   An exempt  employee should only be tracking exception time (i.e. sick, vacation, etc --  any off duty time) but not work hours during the day.   An exempt worker  according the FLSA can only be paid on a fee basis or salary basis -- not on  an hourly basis.  If I am off base let me know, otherwise I would like your  help with how we should approach getting this corrected and possibly having  this covered in a policy on how to deal with employees performing exempt jobs  that are working part-time or reduced schedules.

"Hi, Charla,  I have reviewed the additional fields you described.  Most of them look fine  with me.  I do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace,  citizenship, personal travel, and reason for return from prior assignment.    The questions about birthplace/citizenship are the most risky.  As I have  discussed with others, such questions could create issues of national origin  discrimination, particularly if one's birthplace country is not evident from  any other source.

Any other information may not be necessary.  The question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth  information that we really don't want to keep on a system.  For example, if a  person left because of health reasons, or the birth of a child . . . it  really is not a job-related issue.  What is the purpose of this question?  Is  there a less intrusive way to ask it?     Finally, the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is  asking information that is not job-related.  What is the purpose of that  inquiry?  Is there another way to gather that information?  Let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful -- some of them may be  unwise for the reasons I cited above.  If you would like to discuss this  further, please give me a call.

This means that employment agreements for  VPs and above are not to be generated unless you have received a completed  and approved request form.  Each business unit should call Mary McKendree  (713-345-8085)  for the form and we will fax or hand deliver it to them.  The  form must  be signed by the appropriate HR personnel for the business unit  (names to be provided to Mary McKendree by each business unit) and then  returned to Mary McKendree.  The form will be initialed by someone in  Executive Compensation (Mary McKendree, Mary Joyce, or Pam Butler) and  delivered to you for generating drafts.  Please do not distribute a draft to  anyone without a signed and initialed request form.  Also, as discussed, requests for signing bonuses, retention bonuses, up-front  grants by number of options rather than value, and guaranteed LTI awards are  exceptions to the rules that the business units will need to justify before  they will be approved.  Please do not make changes to these items or add any  provisions to the standard short form without contacting Executive  Compensation.  These procedures have been implemented at the request of the Office of the  Chairman.  Consistent application of compensation standards and attention to  the One Enron goal are key to our success.  Please pass this memo on to others who are impacted by this implementation.   Sheila, would you please ensure that all Compensation Staff receive this?

However, because there are certain  exceptions to the salary basis test (for example, licensed attorneys do not  have to meet that test), it depends on what the employees are doing as to  whether this situation creates a problem under the FLSA.  My recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by  these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue.  If  they do not fit within one of the exceptions, we probably should have them  affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the  overtime rate. You would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the  overtime rate.  If they are not working over 40 hours in a week, it will not  be an issue.  Let me know if you have questions.

Unless I understand  the FLSA incorrectly we cannot in any way calculate salaries on exempt  employees on an hourly basis.  If they are reduced hours we would need to  determine how we would value their job based on a salary basis otherwise we  are treating them as hourly employees and not exempt employees.   An exempt  employee should only be tracking exception time (i.e. sick, vacation, etc --  any off duty time) but not work hours during the day.   An exempt worker  according the FLSA can only be paid on a fee basis or salary basis -- not on  an hourly basis.  If I am off base let me know, otherwise I would like your  help with how we should approach getting this corrected and possibly having  this covered in a policy on how to deal with employees performing exempt jobs  that are working part-time or reduced schedules.

You should have received these awhile ago. We had a virus shutdown, but I cannot think of any other reason why you do not have these. Let me state what I attempted to state in my last message:       1) As to the Data Protection Agreements, we contemplate that an Exhibit C will be attached that will describe the non-exclusive types of information that will be personal data. For your information I am resending the ""annotated"" version of this agreement to describe the significance of the removal of brackets. We also added a section 3.g to allow additions to the purposes for collection. As the regulators in the EU become more refined in their analysis and requirements as to the statement of purpose, you might need to alter purposes.       2) As to the Policy itself, we inserted a line that dates the revision of the policy, and we added a provision in Section 2 corresponding to the change in Section 3.g mentioned above.

In connection with that investigation, Ecogas has hired the law firm of Vinson & Elkins, who has visited our offices, to conduct a review and to make recommendations for improvement and for corrective action.

"John,  Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice  mail and was glad to be in the loop.  In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of  issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits  pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for  Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).    Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain  the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there  another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references  from prior employers, etc.)?    As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that  address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the  information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine  how to proceed.

I do not know how your management would feel about a letter of proposal, which would serve as a temporary work authorization until the final contract is in place but it is something that ESC is willing to do.  Assuming Ms. Cash is able to pull together the Master Service Agreement by Monday and everything is agreeable to ESC then it obviously would not be necessary to implement a temporary work authorization.  However, should we run into further obstacles, I wanted to share with you this possible opportunity.  One of the things that I wanted to discuss with you is your remaining staffing requirements.  I am not sure I have a clear picture of the exact skills you are looking for and would like to avoid sending you resumes which do meet your needs.

Sharon Butcher and I are  working on a project for Enron Corp. HR that requires research on data  protection laws in the various countries in which Enron has employees.  It is  likely that we will subscribe to Clifford Chance's Nextlaw service, a  database of data protection legislation in various countries.  One of the  advantages of Nextlaw is that it is a more cost-effective approach than  engaging local counsel in each jurisdiction to provide the legal research,  and subscribers are entitled to quarterly updates of the information on the  database during the annual subscription period.  At the end of my message to  Christopher, please see the list of countries that we need information  about.  My guess is that any of the jurisdictions you need are covered.

In the meantime, I would be pleased to talk with you and Sharon on Monday at 09.00 Houston time about how we might assist you with your new project.  We have indeed expanded the coverage of our NextLaw service over the last few months. Of the 29 jurisdictions you list below, 17 are now covered by NextLaw.

Enron's annual subscription lasped several months ago, but we are in need of similar services again for a different HR project.  Enron senior management has tasked the HR department with the creation of an internal ""expert directory"" with which all Enron employees can identify other Enron employees who have specific skills (such as language capabilities, experience with particular kinds of projects, political contacts, etc.) that may be useful for new intiatives.  As you can imagine, the data that must be collected from all Enron employees worldwide is significantly more complex than the information we were gathering from international employees when we engaged your firm previously.  We would now like legal advice about what consents must be obtained from employees in various foreign jurisdictions in order to collect and publish the information, whether certain information gathered must be requested on a voluntary basis (and conversely, what information we can require that employees provide), etc. [Please note that all information to be requested will be collected for business purposes (our internal legal department has already informed HR and management that certain information about personal interests, hobbies, and non-professional memberships should not be collected or asked for.)]       I am hopeful that in the time since we last spoke, your firm has added additional jurisdictions to the subscription service, since many of the countries in which we have employees were not on the database in early 1999.  I will list the jurisdictions that are relevant for this project at the end of this message; however, in certain jurisdictions, Enron has only a few employees, and we may elect not to include those employees in the expert directory if we determine that the cost of the legal research for that jurisdiction is not justified by the benefit to Enron.  I am also wondering whether the information included in the database is sufficient for this more complicated project.       My colleague, Sharon Butcher, and I would like to discuss our new project with you to see if Clifford Chance is again willing and able to provide the local research that we require, and to get an estimate of the cost involved.  We were hoping to call you at 9:00 am Houston time on Monday, May 22nd.  Please let me know if this time is not convenient, and we will arrange for another call.  I can be reached by telephone (713-853-5698), fax (713-646-5847), or email (kelly.noel.higgason@enron). I hope you are well, and look forward to our work together.

Taking the agreements in the name of Enron Corp. while irksome to some  has been effective.  It allows any/all commercial companies to reference an  agreement.  This provides for consistency not only in the manner in which  vendors treat different operating companies but also in the manner in which  we treat different vendors.  I think it keeps vendors from employing a divide  and conquer approach.   2.  The agreements need to be updated.  I know that there are some reasons  for using two agreements, i.e., MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT and AGREEMENT FOR  PROJECT SERVICES, but I would vote for combining them if the problems could  be worked out.  It's not that the current agreements are bad but there is  some duplication, terms that are confusing, clauses that are missing, etc.,  all things that could be fixed rather easily.   3.   I don't see why the agreements couldn't be generalized somewhat to cover  all kinds of professional services as opposed to just IT consulting.  4.  If commercial companies need/want to sign PWD's, why can't we work out an  arrangement wherein the PWD is still subject to a Corporate master agreement  but the commercial company signs and indemnifies the corporation, e.g., for  anything that they might do on the PWD.   I realize that nobody has asked me and maybe I don't really understand what  it is that you are trying to accomplish in the modified processbut as I view  it with from an overall Enron Corp., I am concerned that we might be chunking  a methodology that has served us.

These are  separate activity sets which are closely related.  We have ""joined"" these  activity set due to commonality of the PRC and Bonus with Enron, and to  ensure that you have an adequate workload for your project period.    As part of this project initialization, you need to:  Determine the Objectives (set with Kathy Schultea, any other individual(s)  she may indicate as being key to the processes at hand, and Bob Sparger) List Activities/Tasks Set Timelines with Key Dates Set Deliverables and Targets Establish Status Reporting  The primary focus is on the  PRC Historical Information set.  It is very  important that you determine the data sources early on in your project to see  how you might run all activities in parallel.  If this is not possible, you  will need to communicate what the issues may be.  The first step is to schedule a meeting with Kathy Schultea, any other  individual(s) she may indicate as being key to the processes at hand, and me  to go through the list above and begin to setup the various components to  meet the needs of the future staffing teams in the BUs.   As part of our toolkit, Project Status Report sheets follow.    We need to setup the project status reporting ASAP.   Upon completion of the project initialization steps, we will meet to discuss  the performance evaluation process for your project.  Your evaluation will be  based on several criteria related to the project and your individual  performance.  Key items that are part of this process include:  Handling of the project initialization stage (includes project planning and  setup); Overall quality of the project deliverables (includes work products and  documentation accuracy and clarity); The quantity of the overall project work effort (based on volume of the  effort targeted and completion); Project management and communication (based on timeliness, accuracy, and  communication); Feedback from the project customer base (based on teaming, communication,  responsiveness, and initiative); and Other criteria (to be agreed, as appropriate).  The vehicle for evaluation will be the standard PEP form and criteria as used  in the PRC process.  The items listed above are measurable against the  specific skills/behaviors that Enron uses in performance evaluation.   Following are the forms and criteria which will be used in the evaluation  process.   If you have any questions or concerns, please call me at ext. 31858.

The court's unanimous decision in an age-bias dispute from Mississippi could carry profound practical importance as well for lawsuits nationwide that charge employment discrimination based on race, sex and physical disabilities.  The ruling was a huge setback for employers because some federal appeals courts routinely had dismissed lawsuits that lacked ''smoking gun'' evidence of employers' discriminatory intent.  Monday's decision said circumstantial evidence often is enough to sue employers successfully.  Employer organizations were disappointed.  ''The bottom line is ... it may be tougher to get cases out of the hands of the jury,'' said Peter Petsch, a lawyer for the Society for Human Resource Management. ''In some jurisdictions, we're going to see more litigation ... which lasts longer, even for employers who did nothing wrong,'' he said.  But Thomas Osborne, an AARP lawyer, praised the decision as a victory for the some 12 million over-50 workers who belong to his organization because it ''says employers no longer can lie about their personnel decisions and get away with it.''  ''The playing field is no longer slanted toward employers,'' Osborne said.  In a series of employment-bias decisions, the nation's highest court has imposed various requirements on employees who say they were treated illegally. They must show they were subjected to adverse treatment and that the employer's asserted reason for such treatment was phony.  But federal appeals courts have disagreed on a key point: whether employees who discredit an employer's stated reason must also offer proof of a discriminatory motive. Not always, the Supreme Court said Monday.  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that a federal appeals court wrongly relied on ''the premise that a plaintiff must always introduce additional, independent evidence of discrimination.''  ''Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive,'' she said. ''In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer form the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.''  O'Connor said employees will not always be entitled to win a job-bias lawsuit after showing that an employer's explanation for their treatment was false. But she ruled that it was enough in the case of a Mississippi man who said age discrimination cost him his supervisory job at a toilet-seat manufacturing plant.  Roger Reeves sued Sanderson Plumbing Products of Columbus, Miss., after he was fired in 1995 from his job as a hinge-department supervisor in the plant. Reeves, then 57, had worked at the plant for 40 years.  His lawsuit invoked the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and a jury awarded him $70,000 in damages and $28,490 in lost pay.  But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out that award after ruling that Reeves had not offered enough proof of illegal age bias.  Reeves had been required to prove he was over 40 and therefore protected by the federal law, that he had been fired and replaced with someone younger. Such evidence amounted to what courts call a ''prima facie'' showing of discrimination.  Sanderson Plumbing then was required to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the firing. Once it did, the burden shifted back to Reeves to show that the stated reason was false.  He also pointed to derogatory comments made about his age by a supervisor.  Company officials said Reeves had been fired for falsifying time records but he showed that he had not.  The jury apparently concluded that he succeeded in proving bias, but the appeals court said Reeves had to also offer proof that the company's decision was motivated by age bias.  Monday's decision said the appeals court was wrong about that, and reinstated the jury's verdict.  AP-NY-06-12-00 1522EDT  Copyright 2000 The Associated Press.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).  Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references from prior employers, etc.)?  As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that address this type of activity as well.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of  issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits  pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for  Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).    Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain  the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there  another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references  from prior employers, etc.)?    As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that  address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the  information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine  how to proceed.

The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes  to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment  decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have agreed  to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our  use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.

He agreed that settlement of this type of liability by PGE in the amounts  discussed would not be material to PGE (even settlements with a broader group  of individuals).  Payments made by PGE prior to the closing should not have  any impact on Sierra's ownership of PGE or the value of PGE after closing.   Enron has the right to dividend net income out of PGE before closing (up to  certain limits).  Payment of liabilities would probably reduce the amount  that Enron could dividend before closing.  Its not clear whether or not  the  materiality standard was intended to be material to PGE and PGH II taken as a  whole.  The amounts could be material to PGH II, but we assume that this  would not be paid out of PGH II.    I believe that the benefit plan at issue here is sponsored by Portland  General Holdings, Inc.  That entity is not being sold to Sierra Pacific  Resources.  I do not know whether or not there will be any employees that  participate in that plan after PGE and PGH II are sold to Sierra.  Sierra  will cause a new plan with similar benefits to be adopted at the time of the  sale for PGE and PGH II employees.  I suppose that the plan sponsored by  Portland General Holdings, Inc. might be terminated following the sale of PGE.

He agreed that settlement of this type of liability by PGE in the amounts  discussed would not be material to PGE (even settlements with a broader group  of individuals).  Payments made by PGE prior to the closing should not have  any impact on Sierra's ownership of PGE or the value of PGE after closing.   Enron has the right to dividend net income out of PGE before closing (up to  certain limits).  Payment of liabilities would probably reduce the amount  that Enron could dividend before closing.  Its not clear whether or not  the  materiality standard was intended to be material to PGE and PGH II taken as a  whole.  The amounts could be material to PGH II, but we assume that this  would not be paid out of PGH II.    I believe that the benefit plan at issue here is sponsored by Portland  General Holdings, Inc.  That entity is not being sold to Sierra Pacific  Resources.  I do not know whether or not there will be any employees that  participate in that plan after PGE and PGH II are sold to Sierra.  Sierra  will cause a new plan with similar benefits to be adopted at the time of the  sale for PGE and PGH II employees.  I suppose that the plan sponsored by  Portland General Holdings, Inc. might be terminated following the sale of PGE.

Shift differentials and other adjustments for working particular hours or on particular tasks are included in the regular rate of pay.  If, as set forth in the e-mail forwarded to me from Kerry, an employee is paid a shift differential for night shift work, that differential becomes part of the regular rate of pay for the night shift work.  If the same employee rotates between day and night shifts, she/he will be working at two different rates of pay.  This is acceptable but poses special issues for the calculation of overtime.  Federal law permits two methods of calculating overtime for employees who work at two (or more) different regular rates of pay.  Employers may use either a weighted average (29CFR 778.115) or a rate-in-effect (29CFR 778.419) calculation.  l. Weighted Average Calculation  This calculation involves add multiplying the number of hours worked in a workweek at rate 1 times rate 1 and adding the sum to the number of hours worked at rate 2 times the number of hours worked at rate 2.  The sum is then divided by the total number of hours worked to obtain the weighted average regular rate paid for each hour worked.  Overtime premiums of 1/2 the weighted average regular rate are then paid to bring the overtime rate to 1.5 times the weighted average regular rate.   If, as in California, double time rates apply, the premium would be one times the weighted average regular rate.  Example:  Employee works four 8-hour day shifts at $10 per hour and two 8-hour night shifts with a shift premium of $! per hour within the same workweek.  The weighted average calculation would be:  32 (hours) times 10 (dollars) plus 16 (hours) times 11 (dollars) = 496 (dollars)  496 (dollars) divided by 48 (hours) = $10.33 (the weighted average regular rate)  1/2 of $10.33 = $5.17 (the additional overtime premium due for each overtime hour worked).  The weekly pay for this employee would be:  $584.00 for straight time $ 41.36 for overtime premium or  $625.36 for the week.   2. Rate-in-effect With this method, the overtime pay is calculated at the rate in effect at the time the overtime is worked.  In the above example, if the last 8 hours of the week were worked on a day shift, the overtime rate would be 1.5 x $10 or $15 and the employee would be entitled to $120 in overtime pay.  If the last shift was worked on the night shift, the overtime rate would be 1.5 x $11 or $16.50 and the employee would be due $130 in overtime pay.  Please note: These are the federal standards.  State law must also be considered, since the employee is entitled to the most favorable provision is there is a conflict.  For example, California does not permit the use of the rate-in-effect method; employees who work at different rates must be paid on the weighted average overtime pay calculation.  I hope this is helpful.  Please do not hesitate to call if you questions or need clarification.

Enron   Hi Kriste, As we discussed, I offered Gignilliat a $5,000 nuisance value settlement. Gignilliant's counsel, after consulting with his client, said he would take $7,500 to settle the case.  While I think Enron has a very strong defense to the disability claim, I am less certain about the aiding and abetting claim. As we discussed, the Mass. Commission Against Discrimination allowed Gignilliat to amend his charge to add this claim.  Gignilliat may be able to create enough of a fact contest about what the plant manager (Dennis Sherrin) told ANP  about his disability to at least get past the probable cause stage.  While I still think that in the end, Enron has a very good chance of prevailing on the aiding and abetting claim, $7,500 is a good, final resolution to avoid further litigation.  Let me know what you think. Thanks,  Suzanne M. Suppa Bingham Dana LLP 150 Federal Street Boston, MA 02110 (617) 951-8976   ",kriste.sullivan@enron.com,michelle.cash@enron.com,Re: Gignilliat v.

"Sheila, do you think we should meet with Rick Buy about this?  Or, should we  talk about it without Rick and then respond accordingly?

This might be appropriate for a member of the Executive  Committee.    Let me go into some more detail on the above. Point #2 All of Senior Management has told outside constituents (The Board,  Shareholders, Investment Analysts, Rating Agencies, Regulatory Agencies,  Banks and Counterparties) that the RAC Group is independent of the Business  Units.  That is, given that our job is to provide objective analysis of the  business activities, it has provided great comfort to these interested  parties that our judgment is not influenced by the people who are taking risk  on behalf of the firm.  Individual compensation is the foundation of this  independence.  These parties have made judgments to provide capital (dollar  or otherwise) to us based on the knowledge that this group in this  independent configuration exists and is effective.  It has been specifically  cited in reports as a strength and we are asked to make dozens of  presentations each year to that effect.   This is especially true in the  Market Risk function because, unlike other transactions in the firm, there is  no analysis and approval chain for risk taking other than coarse buckets and  the valuation, direction, and volatility are so opaque.  Independence is a  cornerstone of the G-30 recommendations on derivatives.  I believe that these  parties are much more concerned with what they can't see as opposed to what  they can.  I believe that our claim to have an independent function would be jeopardized  if my bonus were a function of earnings targets and a PRC full of trading  MD's. This should be a simple guaranteed minimum.    Point #3 If Enron wants the right to keep me on the shelf for up to 12 months, then  Enron needs to pay for it.  While I understand that sign on bonuses and  retention bonuses are discouraged, I have firm evidence that low level  commercial people are receiving both without any senior management approval.   The amount should approximate the market price for the job (all in) for the  period of the non-compete.  This follows to point #4 - I don't expect anyone  to pay me such additional amounts equal to my ""target"" compensation for 12  months ($500,000!!!!).   The right answer is to shorten the non-compete to a  maximum of 6 months and pay me for that.  I think that it would be equally  stupid for Enron to not have the right to put me on the shelf for a  considerable period of time given that I have and must continue to have  complete access to all positions, p&l and the underlying contracts.   I would  consider giving Enron the option (for a smaller premium) to have me  non-compete which, if exercised, would trigger a larger payment.  There are some other smaller points that I have discussed with Sheila Walton  which can be addressed later.  Please give your consideration to these items asap as I my old contract has  expired.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of  issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits  pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for  Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).    Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain  the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there  another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references  from prior employers, etc.)?

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).  Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references from prior employers, etc.)?  As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine how to proceed.

I raised the issue of a reasonableness test regarding place of  work and whether we should include some wording.  I was advised that it was  not required as it is implicit.  Clause 7.  They will include a no obligation to award an increase sentence.  Options, bonus and sign-on wording will be the ENE wording.  Clause 8. I asked to have wording made clear that it was "".. otherwise as  required by the Company...""  Clause 9.  This will only apply to more senior levels.  The para will be  omitted where overtime is relevant and this will be covered under work rules  and be the statutory amounts.  Clause 10.  We agreed to go flat rate for holidays although we did discuss a  two level approach as 20 days is generous for non managerial staff who will  not use it all anyway.  You and I need to agree on this.  Clause 13.  I was right, it does read that we can only terminate for just  cause and even then it is difficult to prove (there is a case that states  that mere incompetence does not constitute Just Cause).  The definition  examples are those recommended by the Lawyers although they are going to take  up with them a couple of my suggestions to get their view.  Again I will talk  you through this.  As far as employees giving notice, the statutory limit is  2 weeks so the period in the contract is a moral agreement only, although  this is taken more eriously in Japan than elsewhere.  We also discussed the  exec agreement concept which they think will not work but are reviewing the  wording with their lawyers.  Clause 19.  Although in the template, they would recommend including it as  part of the normal terms and conditions so we need to wait for their comments  on the exec agreement.  They are revising template for tomorrow morning.   Work Rules  Fairly standard and not required initially.  They are working on a draft for  us to review and comment on.  Benefits including Pension  They agree with our selection of benefits although they recommend a lump sum  allowance type all employee pension plan which is  a book reserve which pays  out on termination based on salary and length of service.  This is very  common and supplements the Government pension scheme.  This would in in  addition to SRAP and they are sending me more details.  Issues  Corporate/Employment Filings.  They mentioned that there are a number of  filing requirements that need to be done to get businesses underway.  Do we  know what we have doen to date on this front?  Options.  Although these schemes are common there is a lot of legal prep work  involved so I intend to see if Enron Corp HR has started this with Japn, if  not I will get it rolling.  Expat Contracts.  They would like to review our expat contract terms, can you  provide these or do I have them?    I will call you to discuss.  Ihave another conference call with them tomorrow  morning.

The design was tentatively approved last month, subject to final review.  The following revised provision should serve you well in the meantime:    All-Employee Stock Option Program  Enron Corp. has previously awarded stock options to full time and part-time regular employees in designated domestic and international locations through the All Employee Stock Option Program (AESOP).  Stock option grants were made under this program to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2000.  The grants represented value for the time period of 12/31/94 through 12/31/00 or a pro-rata portion if hired after 12/31/94.  Subject to final approval by the Enron Corp. board of directors, a one time award of non-qualified stock options under a replacement program is proposed to be made to eligible employees as of December 29, 2000, in value equal to 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for a 5-year period; salary valuation and value may vary in some international locations).  Program awards are subject to and effective upon the approval by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  Such stock awards will be made pursuant to the appropriate Enron Corp. Stock Plan as determined by the Committee.  The exercise price for grants of stock options will be determined according to the provisions of the Stock Plan under which the award is granted.  The program may or may not be offered in certain domestic and international locations based upon management discretion and/or local labor and employment laws.

"Privileged and Confidential -- Advice Covered by the Attorney-Client Privilege  K2:   I have copied this email to Sharon & Kriste, who are supporting the CALME  region.  My recommendation is to exclude contractors/consultants because  their inclusion would increase the risk that they would be deemed to be  employees, and that a court could determine that they are owed employee  compensation and benefits (a la Microsoft).  This exposure could be high.   Depending on the other indicators of independent contractor status, rating  them along side our employees could be a factor to tilt the balance.

(He knows that they should not be pulled into the VP meeting).   Monica and I initially pushed back on this due to the requirement that only  AIP employees are involved in our mid year process, however, due to David's  instance I'm reverting to you for a decision.   Although I do not have a strong opinion on including the JV's - my concern is  primarily with the Consultants.  Below are my concerns in accommodating this request:-  - The PEP system has officially told employees that the feedback stage has  finished. Although the system is still open we are going to turn off the  system message requesting reviewers to access PEP to review employee.  In  this instance, there would need to be an effort within Janie's team to  communicate to all reviewers of the JV's that they are required to give  feedback.  - The way PEP is set up, we would need to load the consultants as employees  in order to generate the 360 feedback functionality. Due to US law on how to  describe employees/non employees in a database, this comes with legality  issues and I want us to be aware of what we're doing regarding this.  Call me to discuss or if you wish for me to forward the voicemail,   K2   ",kathryn.mclean@enron.com,michelle.cash@enron.com,Re: CALME JV & Consultants,2000-06-27 06:03:00-07:00,sent

"Matt,   Thanks for your email.  I believe that there is an agreement in place between  ENA and Enron Expat Services.  In general, the contract is between ENA and  the employee, if the person is an expat.  The assignment letter covers the  employee's transfer to Expat Services.  We haven't usually amended/assigned  the agreement over to Expat Services, because the payroll/benefits, etc. are  through ENA.   If there are changes to his ENA agreement, it is very easy for me to do them,  and I am happy to handle it.  If Mr. Slovenski is a VP level or above employee (I simply cannot remember  right now), then Executive Compensation needs to be involved.  I hope this answers your questions.  I have copied Sharon Butcher on this  email because she has been involved with assignments/expats for several  years.

I understand from  Lilian that changes would only be to the Annex and would not affect the main  body of the Contract. I can work with Lilian on this once she is able to  finalise the agreed amendments with John Nowlan.   I note your advice that ENA is the correct employing entity and the intended  arrangement is a secondment from Enron Expat Services to ENA.  However, your  suggestion for a clause in the Contract to reference the secondment would not  be sufficient to put the arrangement in place. Rather, there should be an  agreement between Enron Expat Services and ENA. I believe such an agreement  is likely to be in place as Rich is not the first expat here in Singapore  from ENA - John Chismar and John Thomas who are here precede him.   Because I do not have the background to the relevant inter-company  arrangement between ENA and Enron Expat Services, I would suggest  you  discuss with Michelle Cash on to clarify this issue, and perhaps make the  necessary amendments to the letter of offer which presently provides that  Enron Expat Services is the employer and that Rich will be expected to  provide services for ENA, instead of secondment from ENA to Enron Expat  Services  Regards Matt     Michelle Hargrave  06/26/2000 09:40 PM  To: Lilian Low/SIN/ECT@ECT cc: Matthias Lee/SIN/ECT@ECT, Kimberly Rizzi/HOU/ECT@ECT, John L  Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Chismar/SIN/ECT@ECT, Tim  Poullain-Patterson/LON/ECT@ECT, Angeline Poon/SIN/ECT@ECT, Michelle  Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: URGENT : Employment Contract - Rich Slovensky    Lillian,  We were discussing this with our International HR Rep and we feel that since  the offer letter indicates Enron Expat Services as the employe, the  employment agreement should reflect employment by ENA and we need to add a  clause secunding Mr. Slovinski to Enron Expat Service.  PLEASE have Matthias  make the amendments so we can get this in place as soon as possible.  I am  sure that as long as Legal in Singapore makes the necessary changes it will  be fine.

Since Legal Singapore is aware of the situation, and if it is agreeable, we  can make amendments to the existing hard copies and have Matthias review  them.  This should expedite this.

I thought we put this issue to  bed several years ago.  Consultants and Contractors are to be reviewed, if at  all, by their respective employers.  If the Consultant and/or Contractor is  not an employee of a third party employer, then Enron has the right to  determine if they are meeting the terms and provisions of their contract.   However, this does not mean they are to be included in the PEP and PRC  process.   To include them opens too many doors with respect to the proper  classification of these individuals.  If we treat them like employees, we may  find that a court determines they should be employees and thus eligible for  all employee benefits, a la MicroSoft.    Thanks.

My recommendation is to exclude contractors/consultants because  their inclusion would increase the risk that they would be deemed to be  employees, and that a court could determine that they are owed employee  compensation and benefits (a la Microsoft).  This exposure could be high.   Depending on the other indicators of independent contractor status, rating  them along side our employees could be a factor to tilt the balance.  Let me know if you have any questions.

(He knows that they should not be pulled into the VP meeting).   Monica and I initially pushed back on this due to the requirement that only  AIP employees are involved in our mid year process, however, due to David's  instance I'm reverting to you for a decision.   Although I do not have a strong opinion on including the JV's - my concern is  primarily with the Consultants.  Below are my concerns in accommodating this request:-  - The PEP system has officially told employees that the feedback stage has  finished. Although the system is still open we are going to turn off the  system message requesting reviewers to access PEP to review employee.  In  this instance, there would need to be an effort within Janie's team to  communicate to all reviewers of the JV's that they are required to give  feedback.  - The way PEP is set up, we would need to load the consultants as employees  in order to generate the 360 feedback functionality. Due to US law on how to  describe employees/non employees in a database, this comes with legality  issues and I want us to be aware of what we're doing regarding this.  Call me to discuss or if you wish for me to forward the voicemail,   K2         ",kathryn.mclean@enron.com,michelle.cash@enron.com,Re: CALME JV & Consultants,2000-06-28 02:04:00-07:00,sent

One small  change is currently contemplated however.   Seller has insisted that we give  them a maximum number of non-union employees that we will want them to  terminate.  We have suggested that the maximum number be 30.  This seems good  at least for WARN Act purposes.  As it is currently contemplated (not in the  documents but rather in the most recent negotiations), we would provide the  Seller with written notice (no later than 3 or 4 business days before closing  but after our financing contingency has expired) as to which employees would  need to be terminated.  One other thing that I have heard is that we want the  Seller to be the terminating party because the commercial folks would prefer  not to have to tell our analysts that we did the firing.  If you and the  other labor folks feel strongly about making the Buyer the terminating party,  please call me ASAP and I can hook you in with Rodney Malcolm et al to  discuss.

Unless Michelle or another  opines differently, I believe it is incumbent upon us to determine who  mis-used that e-mail address.  This is not to say that an employee should be  disciplined for raising complaints; obviously that would be retaliatory in  nature.  And so, if this person had simply left an anonymous voice message or  old-fashioned letter with OTC, I would have no issue.  But, here, this person  has sent a communication ostensibly from ECT's OTC and apparently has access  to do so in the future.  In my mind, that activity must be addressed and  ceased.   I suspect that it is technologically feasible to determine the source of the  message.

With all our discussions about Communication within Enron, I am now  communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to  other parties without change.  1)  Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the  upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period,  not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already  occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such  review period.  This is only fair to our employees so that they know the  criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance.  2)  The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are  willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without  a bunch of red tape.  There is this idea that unsolicited input works within  the system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and  it still requires that the supervisor approve such input.  There needs to be  an unobstructed communication line for this input.  The theory of upward  feedback should also be questioned.  I have never been asked to provide input  to my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that I  have worked for that position.  Are Managing Directors exempt from this  process?  This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner.   How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with  individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate?  3)  There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the  process.  There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute  minimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon the  job function.  I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to  provide input were not even solicited.  There was one individual that  partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was  not even asked for input.  4)  What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our  PRC definitions is still being debated.  It has been described by several HR  representatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.  Neither  one of the definitions describes such performance as ""simply doing the job"".   Because of such confusion, the reviewers when they provide input do not  effectively and precisely rate the employee.  What we end up with in the PRC  is an over-inflated representation of each employee and the committee has to  pull the entire group back a notch.  With better definitions and  communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions, it will  give us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be  lacking.  Thanks for your listening ear.              ",brian.schaffer@enron.com,michelle.cash@enron.com,Re: Performance Review Process,2000-07-13 04:04:00-07:00,sent
"Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice and confidentiality should be maintained  The attached memo describes a recent decision from the National Labor  Relations Board regarding an employee's right to be ""represented"" by a  co-worker or other person during a disciplinary meeting.  Employees in  unionized settings always have had this right, but it now has been extended  by the NLRB's ruling.   The ruling was contentious -- there were dissents -- and I expect it to be  appealed quickly.

"Privileged and Confidential  Attorney-Client Communication This E-Mail Contains Legal Advice  In the Barbed Wire Purchase Agreement is the provision that the Purchaser has  45 days to identify those employees of Company whom it would like the Company  to terminate from employment prior to closing.  The Seller is providing a  limited indemnity for Purchaser's actions in selecting those employees.  The  indemnity expressly excludes claims against ENA for the selection of those  employees.  This indemnity thus excludes claims for discrimination on the  basis of age, sex, race, religion, etc.  The indemnity exclusion also could  be interpreted to exclude claims for tortious interference.  Thus, if ENA is going to exercise its right to select Company employees under  that provision, ENA will assume the risk of claims by affected employees.  I  can assist  you in identifying legal risks in the selection process and  determining methods to manage the risks of those claims.  Let me know if you would like to discuss this issue.

I recall we changed wording due to some concerns you had expressed. Perhaps  you can restate them here for everyone.  However, regardless of above I remain of opinion that descriptors and labels  are proving a distraction from what should be a more relative process.  Perhaps the main message here is to convey something that helps us put these  descriptors in the context of a guide only (starting point or indicative  illustration) rather than absolute scale.   Bottom-line it is rather difficult to see how we could change any of this for  the mid year.

It is very important that certain benefits matters be addressed  and resolved before the Closing Date.  Attached is a copy of our Benefits Required Action list, which was sent to  Dolores Lenfest, Mark Greenberg, and Mr. del Vecchio on July 21, 2000.  We  spoke with Stuart Zisman today, who suggested we make sure that both of you  have receive a recent copy of the list.  (Please let us know if you have any  problems opening the WordPerfect document.  The page set-up to print should  be 'landscape'.)  Among the outstanding issues is the amount of potential withdrawal liability  existing in the 2 multiemployer pension plans.   These numbers should be  requested from the multiemployer plans as soon as possible.  A concern has  been raised as to whether requesting such information from the multiemployer  plans will create problems with the union or plan because the union or plan  might be given the false impression that GSP anticipates terminating these  benefits.  We do not expect any such problems (especially if the plan is told  that the sale is anticipated and the buyer wants to make sure of its  potential liabilities).  A request for withdrawal liability, although not a  daily event, is something that falls within the ordinary administration of a  plan.   The plans should either have this amount immediately available, or be  able to calculate this amount for you.  If you would like us to assist you  with obtaining this information, please let us know.  We have included Dolores Lenfest as the responsible person for the majority  of the required actions, since she had been our main contact.  If any of  these actions have been assigned to another responsible party, please let us  know.  Thank you.

"I will look closely at the sample letters to see whether there is any way to  avoid the conclusion you have reached, which appears to be the correct one.   I have a meeting right now, and will focus on it right after that -- I'll  send another email once I've completed that review early this afternoon.   Michelle      Hoyt Thomas@ENRON 07/28/2000 11:23 AM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Jon Chapman/LON/ECT@ECT, David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Confidential    Michelle, Melissa Laing and I talked to Jon Chapman today, and basically Jon  deferred to you, since the RW employees in NY are a question for US  employment law.  Melissa and I do believe that the  RW US-based employees that were given  UK-style employment letters, such as the sample one I gave you, are our  employees, because of those letters; they were given ""offer letters"" by MG  before the MG/Enron deal went unconditional and in most cases they accepted  them, so they were MG employees when all MG employees became our employees.   If it is a fact that they are Enron employees, we have to figure out the  liability associated with terminating them!    It appears that on Monday, MG and Enron leadership will decide to exit some  of the London and New York RW business that MG acquired, and some (minimum 9,  max 15) of the former RW employees will need to be terminated during  August.   John Sheriff and Gary Hickerson both want to know the cost of that  decision.   Right now we are assuming that we are liable for the severance  periods stated in the offer letters to the people; we would like to be able  to avoid that cost  (estimated at $700k and $1.5M, depending on who is  redundant) or reduce it if possible.  However, if it is your recommendation  that we have to honor those letters, so be it.  If you have any questions, please call Melissa Laing (tie line 8303 6617) in  the UK and she can find me.

The RW employees may or  may not be ours.  It is my understanding that we own the assets of RW, and  that we decided to hire certain, key personnel from RW.  The remaining RW  employees do not automatically come with the assets.  I am working on  obtaining more information on the RW side of things from lawyers here in the  US.  Key to employment decisions will be provisions of the asset purchase  agreement, if any are applicable.  You might check with Jon Chapman in the UK  to see whether he has any more information on this point.  Thanks.

Assuming that you do:  I will bring copies of all the offer letters MG wrote to RW employees, I  think there are something like 27 or 28.  They are all very similar to the  one or two that I have already given you.  I believe that we will not want to keep some of the businesses that are being  acquired with Rudolph Wolff, particularly the FX business in New York.   Naturally, some of the people in the potentially discontinued business  received the onerous letters.  Gary Hickerson has to decide what he is going  to do with this by August 18, if not sooner.  With the letters that were  delivered , I would like to get an opinion from you on what we have to do to  terminate the people associated with the business, assuming that Gary wants  to shut it down.  Also, MG have 4 to 6 employees in Montreal.  We (HR) are trying to convince  the business side that we do not want any people in Montreal because of the  employment laws . . . but it does not appear that we will succeed.  We may  reduce the size of the office, though, and we may not want to put them on the  Canadian payroll, particularly is we only keep 1-2 people there.  Do you have  contacts in Montreal that can advise us on how to terminate any employees  that we choose to terminate?  What would be the Enron position on having them  on a separate payroll from Enron Canada?

Daniel  Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and  will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.   Congress passed the EEA in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate  America collects, uses, and protects valued information.  In addition to  explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include  ""hypothetical"" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines)  to illustrate his points.  This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls  (CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC's  Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of  issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of  competitive intelligence.  This particular speaking engagement is designed to  raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate  thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well  as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information.   I  believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find  ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.    The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:00 PM, in the 50th floor  Conference room.  Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell.      P.S.  By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will  concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the ""Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act (FCPA),"" and will likely be scheduled for the fall.

employees:  ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especially  proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.   I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that  you have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you  for that.    Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA  and Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make  sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and  that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.  To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen  Corporation -- to survey our organization; to ""take its pulse"" if you will;  to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we  could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the ""necessary tools""  and breaking down any ""barriers.""  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants  who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC will  meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight  our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments,  and the like.  This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the  goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.   Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that  input.    Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC  consultant.  Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest  opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we  cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it  will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not  received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts  with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and  Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.  Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that only  through open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.   Thank you.

Here are my comments:  1 - I think this needs to be a UK form contract rather than US. Otherwise I  think it is difficult for me to mainatin all the UK benefits (Pension, share  plan etc.,). All numbers bar base can stay in US$'s. The Base will need to be  translated at 1.5 into UKpds (ie pds150,000 then the car allce subtracted  pds10,800 and shown as such) and state in the contract how much should be  paid on US payroll and how much in UK (my current arrangements allows me to  keep about pds600 per month paid in the UK so I can pay UK bills). I am happy  to prepare a draft of this is you wish for Michelle and John Chapman to  review.  2 - I'd like confirmation that new base is effective June 1, 2000. This is  when we started these discussions.  3 - The cash retention amounts of pds45,000 are missing. We agreed this would  be paid 3/01 and 3/02.  4 - There are 3 stock option grants on appendix A of $100k each, but I  believe we agreed $120k on signing and $120k 6/01. Additionally given you  were uncomfortable with additional base bump in Jan 01 I suggested we add  that $25k to the second option grant making it $120k in options on signing  and $145k in 6/01. Incidentally, can we make these clearly 5 year options  with standard vesting (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).  5 - On Bonus targets, can we insert top 25% as a VP, top 50% otherwise, after  each target.  6 - On ENE LTI awards, I believe we agreed this years award of $300 would be  guaranteed. For 01 I would like again wording saying ""as a VP"" inserted after  25% target and top 50% otherwise.  7 - Not sure if we need to but obviously the Relo memo might need to be  referenced with regards to this not being the sole agreement etc.,  Thanks  David ",mary.joyce@enron.com,michelle.cash@enron.com,Thanks for draft contract,2000-08-10 06:13:00-07:00,sent
"Debi,  Your plan sounds good to me.  You all have done a good job of researching  this data, and I believe we are in a strong position.  My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting  resumes from them.  What is the harm in accepting them?  Are we obligated to  interview the candidate?  Given this situation, it is possible that telling  them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially  since their ""proven track record"" is only for one placement.  It does not  appear as if they are flooding us with resumes.  Let me know if my assumption  is not correct.  Also, I am not sure your apology is necessary.  It certainly is  well-intentioned, but I wouldn't want it to be construed as some sort of  admission of wrongdoing.  So, unless you feel compelled, . . . .  Thanks.  Michelle      Debi Vanwey 08/10/2000 02:03 PM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Jennifer Cronin/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Contracting Solutions  Our research is complete with John Nguyen and Mark Delaro.    There is only  one John Nguyen that works for Enron, and he is at EBS.   This is not the  same John Nguyen that was sent from Contracting Solutions.  I talked with the  Enron John personally and compared past employment to the CS John.    The  John Nguyen that was sent by CS was sent on 5/4 to Keith Dziadek for an  opening he had.   We got no response from Keith, which for him is considered  a no.    We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS.    He was  directly recruited by Ergos, presented by them, and hired through them.    Jennifer talked with Mark  and he states that he has never talked to a  recruiting firm named Contracting Solutions.   If CS did indeed present his  resume to Enron, then they should be able to produce the email with date/time  stamp.    Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet.   I feel Robert and  I should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation.   Robert  had mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week, and I  think we should make good on the promise.  Here are my recommendations - please give me your thoughts.  1)  I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone. 2)  Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John  Nguyen, based on above facts. 3)  Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time.   The recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list, and CS  is not on it since no one is interested in working with them.   We should let  them know that yes, they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract  placement, but this does not require us to accept resumes from them.    We  accept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with  recruiting.    We should offer to take another look at them in 90 days, give  them a second chance, and have the guidelines for the trial period well  defined.  They should contact me directly at that time. 4)  We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn, the  difficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them,  Kathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been  made, and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in  order to press the point.   They should be aware of the basis of Jennifer's  decision not to employ them as a vendor:   1)  inadequate resume flow  2)  poor working relationship with account manager. 5)  We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other  company including Continential, Shell Services, and Dynegy, and after  addressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred.   Nor did  she did send Mark Delaro's resume to Ergos.  We have no reason to believe  that she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron, nor that  she will in the future. 6) Cheryl Charles (Maddison) presented her resume to Robert and Ryan, and  Ryan forwarded to me in the past 2 weeks, and has not claimed association  with CS.   We have no recruiter openings at this time, and she has been  informed of this by Ryan and myself.

"Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice  Hoyt and Melissa,  I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort  of services for MG/RW.  It looks like there may be some key personnel we want  to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.   I am not  really familiar with the specific facts here.  The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract  personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their  activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and  other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  So, if the plan is  to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an  employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a  supervisor.  Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.  If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers  -- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.    It  is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting  agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other  alternative).  Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people  who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk  of the contract workers.  I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a  definitive conclusion.  So, let's try to discuss it.  I am booked until about  11 this morning, but am available after that.

This is where an agency employee claims that  he/she was treated like an employee, therefore he/she should get employee  benefits (vs. benefits from the agency company, which are probably weak).   Since we did a share purchase of MG, if the agency employees filed a suit  against MG claiming that they are really employees, I think that we would  have to defend it.  I am not an attorney, but I am going to send this to Michelle Cash, who can  advise us on the position we should take.  I would think that if we single  out certain employees to become Enron employees and the remainder stay as  agency employees, this would enhance the legal position of the agency  employees (versus everyone staying as an agency employee).  Michelle, can you  help us with this one?  Thanks.  Melissa, I also think we should minimize distribution on this discussion . .  .

We discussed how  the employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees, although they are  infact agency workers.  Ed confirmed that Martha and half a dozen other  employees quite clearly should become Enron employees and should get  applicable benefits.  The other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should  become Enron employees and should remain as agency staff.  He realises that the original granting of Share Options has slightly ""muddied  the water"" with regard to whether these employees are employees of Enron or  the agency.  He was not involved with the original decision to grant these  employees Share Options.  We discussed the issues (in broad terms, as I could not remember all of the  specific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals  Enron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy  thing to do.    However, this is his ideal scenario.  How viable is it that we can do this  for him?  He also made the point that Martha is the most senior executive in Henry Bath  Inc. and is one of his most valuable employees.

If we accept resumes from an agency it means  establishing a full working relationship with them which is time consuming  for the recruiter.  We have to constantly QA them and answer their phone  calls, and it is more work than it seems from the outside.   They almost need  to be coached all the time unless they are really good, which is rare.    CS  is one of the fairly high maintenance agencies.   This is why we are going to  a preferred vendor list.    We have lots of agencies that want to work with  us, and choosing those that we can count on to get us good candidates  quickly, and take the least amount of our time saves a lot of time for the  recruiters.   After Jennifer told Kathyrn she wasn't going to work with her,  Kathyrn did flood her inbox with unsolicited resumes.   That would certainly  make me not want to work with them.   I can force the issue and ask one of  the recruiters to work with them if you feel we need to, however I feel that  until Kathryn cools off a little, this would not be productive.    As for the  apology, I will always apologize if I am clearly in the wrong, however, I  think that definitely in this case it would be construed as an admission of  wrongdoing on Enron's part.   I'm fine with letting go of it.   This has been  a good learning experience for me.    There have been a couple of phone calls  this week where I was consciously more polite with agency/sales phone calls  than I would have been prior to last week.    Jennifer had some fear up  yesterday about addressing an issue with an agency because of the CS issue,  which is understandable, and we're working through it together.  I want her  to be able to stay in her power with these people, and we just need to learn  new ways to do that.   It's a tough job dealing with agencies day after day -  really wears you down.    We're going to write some scripts for talking with  them in the future, and the recruiters will route all the new ones through me  so they all get the same story.    We're also putting some new processes in  place so that we are consistent in our relationships with agencies.     Hopefully this will help eliminate some of these issues in the future.

You all have done a good job of researching  this data, and I believe we are in a strong position.  My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting  resumes from them.  What is the harm in accepting them?  Are we obligated to  interview the candidate?  Given this situation, it is possible that telling  them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially  since their ""proven track record"" is only for one placement.  It does not  appear as if they are flooding us with resumes.  Let me know if my assumption  is not correct.  Also, I am not sure your apology is necessary.  It certainly is  well-intentioned, but I wouldn't want it to be construed as some sort of  admission of wrongdoing.  So, unless you feel compelled, . . . .  Thanks.

There is only  one John Nguyen that works for Enron, and he is at EBS.   This is not the  same John Nguyen that was sent from Contracting Solutions.  I talked with the  Enron John personally and compared past employment to the CS John.    The  John Nguyen that was sent by CS was sent on 5/4 to Keith Dziadek for an  opening he had.   We got no response from Keith, which for him is considered  a no.    We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS.    He was  directly recruited by Ergos, presented by them, and hired through them.    Jennifer talked with Mark  and he states that he has never talked to a  recruiting firm named Contracting Solutions.   If CS did indeed present his  resume to Enron, then they should be able to produce the email with date/time  stamp.    Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet.   I feel Robert and  I should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation.   Robert  had mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week, and I  think we should make good on the promise.  Here are my recommendations - please give me your thoughts.  1)  I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone. 2)  Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John  Nguyen, based on above facts. 3)  Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time.   The recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list, and CS  is not on it since no one is interested in working with them.   We should let  them know that yes, they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract  placement, but this does not require us to accept resumes from them.    We  accept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with  recruiting.    We should offer to take another look at them in 90 days, give  them a second chance, and have the guidelines for the trial period well  defined.  They should contact me directly at that time. 4)  We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn, the  difficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them,  Kathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been  made, and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in  order to press the point.   They should be aware of the basis of Jennifer's  decision not to employ them as a vendor:   1)  inadequate resume flow  2)  poor working relationship with account manager. 5)  We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other  company including Continential, Shell Services, and Dynegy, and after  addressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred.   Nor did  she did send Mark Delaro's resume to Ergos.  We have no reason to believe  that she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron, nor that  she will in the future. 6) Cheryl Charles (Maddison) presented her resume to Robert and Ryan, and  Ryan forwarded to me in the past 2 weeks, and has not claimed association  with CS.   We have no recruiter openings at this time, and she has been  informed of this by Ryan and myself.

With all our discussions about Communication within Enron, I am now  communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to  other parties without change.  1)  Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the  upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period,  not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already  occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such  review period.  This is only fair to our employees so that they know the  criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance.  2)  The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are  willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without  a bunch of red tape.  There is this idea that unsolicited input works within  the system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and  it still requires that the supervisor approve such input.  There needs to be  an unobstructed communication line for this input.  The theory of upward  feedback should also be questioned.  I have never been asked to provide input  to my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that I  have worked for that position.  Are Managing Directors exempt from this  process?  This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner.   How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with  individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate?  3)  There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the  process.  There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute  minimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon the  job function.  I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to  provide input were not even solicited.  There was one individual that  partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was  not even asked for input.  4)  What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our  PRC definitions is still being debated.  It has been described by several HR  representatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.  Neither  one of the definitions describes such performance as ""simply doing the job"".   Because of such confusion, the reviewers when they provide input do not  effectively and precisely rate the employee.  What we end up with in the PRC  is an over-inflated representation of each employee and the committee has to  pull the entire group back a notch.  With better definitions and  communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions, it will  give us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be  lacking.

"Andrea,   You are right.  I remember that you wanted to be included, but somehow, as I  was trying to get away for vacation, I failed to remember to tell Twanda, who  was setting up the meeting.  I apologize for the oversight -- it was not  intentional.  I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent  meetings.  I am sorry about this one.    Basically, the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC -- is it a  compensation system or a feedback system?  Because the process tries to  address both, there is a tension between the organization's interests (comp,  promotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.)  This  tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the  fact that we have a comparative rating system.  This tension has given people  lots of heartburn.    To address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn't create  too much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that  comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we  evaluate employees.  The preference was to go to numbered categories instead  of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and  the comparative rating.  For example, a ""strong"" performer really could be  excellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third  category.  For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be  problematic.  Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the  categories to get away from the old ""HR"" language.  For example, a category 1  performer would have a descriptor that said something like:  ""Always raises  the bar; franchise player,"" etc. rather than a ""HR"" definition relating to  demonstrating criteria.  Also, people had the view that needs improvement and  issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn't much difference  between the two.  There was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem  more competitive.  Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC  appeared to be a ""black box,"" and the desire to explain and communicate more  about the process.  This was only the first meeting.  I will make sure that you are invited to  attend any subsequent ones, and I apologize for the first one.  Let me know if you have any questions.

The numeric ratings would be based on more relative  behavioral descriptors to categorize an employee's performance, and not the  absolute standards that the current descriptors represent.    I have been tasked with drafting the verbiage for this possible change which  will, of course, require review and approval by the senior levels of the  organization.

I  would recommend the leaders of the appropriate councils be involved.    Michelle Cash@ECT 08/25/2000 10:22 AM To: Andrea Yowman/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Re: Potential Change of Cluster Descriptors for PRC Reviews    Andrea,   You are right.  I remember that you wanted to be included, but somehow, as I  was trying to get away for vacation, I failed to remember to tell Twanda, who  was setting up the meeting.  I apologize for the oversight -- it was not  intentional.  I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent  meetings.  I am sorry about this one.    Basically, the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC -- is it a  compensation system or a feedback system?  Because the process tries to  address both, there is a tension between the organization's interests (comp,  promotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.)  This  tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the  fact that we have a comparative rating system.  This tension has given people  lots of heartburn.    To address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn't create  too much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that  comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we  evaluate employees.  The preference was to go to numbered categories instead  of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and  the comparative rating.  For example, a ""strong"" performer really could be  excellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third  category.  For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be  problematic.  Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the  categories to get away from the old ""HR"" language.  For example, a category 1  performer would have a descriptor that said something like:  ""Always raises  the bar; franchise player,"" etc. rather than a ""HR"" definition relating to  demonstrating criteria.  Also, people had the view that needs improvement and  issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn't much difference  between the two.  There was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem  more competitive.  Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC  appeared to be a ""black box,"" and the desire to explain and communicate more  about the process.  This was only the first meeting.  I will make sure that you are invited to  attend any subsequent ones, and I apologize for the first one.  Let me know if you have any questions.

The numeric ratings would be based on more relative  behavioral descriptors to categorize an employee's performance, and not the  absolute standards that the current descriptors represent.    I have been tasked with drafting the verbiage for this possible change which  will, of course, require review and approval by the senior levels of the  organization.

I have spoken with persons in HR and benefits and have put together  the following ""headlines"" for employee matters.  This list is a first cut,  based upon my discussions with persons I could reach today; thus, it may not  be exhaustive.  Details of certain issues, as described below, will have to  be worked out.  Of course, your team may choose to modify/delete items from this list,  depending on the exact nature of the deal.  In the interest of time, however,  I am sending this list to our lawyers at V&E to begin drafting the employee  provisions of the sale agreement, which I understand you would like to see on  Thursday.  Any modifications based upon your team's comments should not be  difficult.  The employment provisions may include:  Buyer will hire all employees identified by Seller. The hired employees will have a title that is at least the same/equivalent as  their title at Enron for a two-year period after closing. Buyer will give all hired employees credit for years of service at Enron for  purposes of participation in Buyer's benefits (though not accruals), thus  allowing the hired employees to have immediate participation in Buyer's  benefit and compensation plans (e.g., 401k, vacation eligibility, etc.). The hired employees will be paid, at a minimum, the same base salary they  earned at Enron (which would include the merit increase for 2001) for a  two-year period after closing. The hired employees will receive the same level of total cash compensation as  their last year of Enron employment for one full year after closing (the  buyer can make this happen through base salary, bonus, etc.). The hired employees will receive benefits (e.g., health insurance, life  insurance, etc.) that are comparable to those they had in their last year of  employment with Enron (although we probably will have some discussions over  our sick leave policy, which is generous). Buyer will retain severance benefits at Seller's level for one year after  closing, after which the hired employees will be eligible for severance under  the Buyer's plans (with credited service). Before Buyer terminates the employment of a hired employee (other than for  cause -- to be defined), Buyer shall inform Seller, which will have the right  to re-employ the employee at Enron, with credited service. For employees with less than 5 years of service, some concession for unvested  portion of Cash Balance Plan may be necessary.  Open issues/questions include:  Equity:  What is to be done with unvested equity?  For example, in December,  every Enron employee will be granted stock options worth 25% of their base  salary (based on the Black-Scholes valuation).  Also, persons with other  equity grants may forfeit those grants upon closing.  An evaluation of the  various plans and participants will be necessary to determine exactly where  any issues exist, as well as possible resolutions of those issues.  In light  of the appreciation in Enron's stock, this equity issue may be significant. Pension:  What will happen to hired employees with potential eligibility  under Enron's pension plan?  If you have any questions about these issues, please give me a call at x  3-6401.  If I receive additional feedback, I will let you know.  Thanks.

We do not want to react to, and treat, the symptoms (number of absolute  categories), without full consideration of the root cause and setting a plan  to address it.  The real change issue as I see it is job description and  ""position"" classification.   The real project is to rationalise the job  structures within Enron - simplify wherever possible.  Target a cut from 24  categories to say 12.  This impacts not only the PRC, but how we look at  compensation across the levels, function performed (e.g., commercial,  commercial support, technical) and specialization areas (e.g.,  legal,  accounting, IT, engineering, HR, etc.)  With respect to current yearend PRC, it is hard to change the agreed process  midstream.  It is doable if we can show where/how certain of the categories  are ""equivalent"" and should be considered together.   Only caveat is to  ensure we do not render the root cause untreatable by addressing symptoms.   Tim / Gerry:  How would you like to approach this?  Two key groups we need to link in are  Compensation (Mary Joyce, Pam Butler) and PRC (Gina Corteselli, Andrea  Yowman).  Let talk early next week.

In other areas it is harder and grading provides a methodology (far from  perfect) for grouping and providing structure around a set of skills and how  they are valued in the organisation. To lose them without providing some  other method of measuring value e.g. a more robust PRC process, would run the  risk of making a sometimes too subjective process even more subjective.  Give me a small number of loose grades anytime. So we should aim for nearer  to 8/9 and head away from the 24 - having 7 levels for admins does smack of  bureacracy.

My view remains we should have a strong ambition to significantly reduce and  simplify the current grade structures. Far from adding additional levels a  fundamental analysis should be made of the need for any more than 5 from top  to bottom. In this regard I would lay down the following challenge for your  comments: why would the following structure not work better in promoting a  flat, entrepreneurial, open, fast paced organisation, while also  significantly reducing the bureaucracy:  Number of PRC levels Commercial   Support/Technical   Key 1    MD/VP    Same     Collapse 2 2    Deal Makers    Management    Collapse 3 3    A&A's    Specialists/Consultants/Professionals Collapse 3/5 4    Admin (non- Exempt)  Same     Collapse 7!

"Debbie, would you please forward this to Deanne, Lisa Anouilh, and Mary  Thamm?  I've lost those email addresses!  Thanks.  Hello girls!  Is everyone ready to party on Friday???

Beech is off of  Newcastle between Bissonnet and Bellaire.   Alternative:  Take Loop 610, exit Bissonnet, go inside the loop, then go  south (right) on Newcastle.  Beech is off Newcastle.  In the interest of keeping this simple and quick (since I am going to be  travelling from Boston that day), I am going to order fajitas and serve  margaritas and wine.  Rather than have people bring or do stuff, everyone can  just toss in some cash (it won't be much more than $10-ish) based upon how  many people will be there.  So, let me know, and I'll count you in (and get  your booze!).  So far, I have ""yes"" from Blaine and her friend who makes the jewelry (bring  your orders), Mata Kroger, Rank, Scofield, Stith, Gussett, and Blanco.   Sholeen is a ""no"" because her neighbors are giving her a going away party,  and she thought it would be kind of tacky not to show up.  Let me know if  these plans have changed.  If we have left anyone out, please include them on the list and have them get  back to me to say they'll be there.    See you Friday!

Should we include the standard ""affiliate"" language for clarity and to  maximize our flexibility?  2.  Can you tell me the basic differences between the PWD and SSD?  3.  Do we want to impose the Enron Code of Ethics referred to in para. 3a.,  Performance Standards?  4.  I personally believe that we should delete reference to the ""Staffing  Service Fee"" in para. 4b and the ""Liquidation                Table"" in para.  4c.  These type of fees/factors are subject to many outside influences and  can fluctuate considerably with the marketplace.  I think that we may lose  some negotiations leverage by locking any such rates in the basic contract.   Those kind of issues can still be worked on a case by case basis and  incorporated into the contract by amendment, or possibly, the PWD.

One could argue ( and  they obviously are ) that health and welfare coverage constitutes part of  their employment and should be paid to them as part of their separation.  If we provide it to one then we really need to be consistent and apply it to  everyone.  I'm sure they are speaking to each other on a daily basis.  2) Russell Gilardi's attorney has made comment that one could interpret his  contract to mean that he has a fixed term contract through the end of the  year.  Here is the wording verbatim:   'Commencing on your agreement to the terms of this letter, both you and the  Company will be required to give not less than 3 months notice in writing to  terminate your employment, such notice to expire at any time on or after 1st  January 2001.'  I think Hoyt missed this last part when he sent you the info for the  separation agreements.  For your info, other RW employees with this  particular type of wording had their contracts fully paid out.  3) Joel Insinga is requesting that his non-compete be reduced from 6 months  to 3 months.   He was with MG for a little over a month.  I've asked the SVP  of the division for his thoughts and should hear something tomorrow.     Thanks and hopefully we are nearing the end.!

One could argue ( and  they obviously are ) that health and welfare coverage constitutes part of  their employment and should be paid to them as part of their separation.  If we provide it to one then we really need to be consistent and apply it to  everyone.  I'm sure they are speaking to each other on a daily basis.  2) Russell Gilardi's attorney has made comment that one could interpret his  contract to mean that he has a fixed term contract through the end of the  year.  Here is the wording verbatim:   'Commencing on your agreement to the terms of this letter, both you and the  Company will be required to give not less than 3 months notice in writing to  terminate your employment, such notice to expire at any time on or after 1st  January 2001.'  I think Hoyt missed this last part when he sent you the info for the  separation agreements.  For your info, other RW employees with this  particular type of wording had their contracts fully paid out.  3) Joel Insinga is requesting that his non-compete be reduced from 6 months  to 3 months.   He was with MG for a little over a month.  I've asked the SVP  of the division for his thoughts and should hear something tomorrow.     Thanks and hopefully we are nearing the end.!

"Anne,  I have reviewed the P&S Agreement for Triple Lutz.  From my perspective, it  generally looks fine.  I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add  any he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.  In Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.  I  believe this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be  identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds  $250K.    We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the  provisions of Section 4.13(iii).  Section 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not  required by law.  However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the  future, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key  personnel to stay with the company through closing.  This may be done with  the Buyer's consent, but we may be tying our hands.  Section 6.2(e) contains  a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.  In addition, Section 4.8 states that we won't enter into or amend any  employment contracts.  We do not renew employment contracts at a single time,  and the contracts of key personnel may expire.  Do we want to tie our hands  and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?  Section 6.2(l)  also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.  In Section 4.10, the wording ""(other than Environmental Laws)"" suggests that  we are not in compliance with environmental laws.  Rephrasing that sentence  to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.  In Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind  to customers.  I don't think we can say that, given that we regularly host  client development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and  provide Enron goodies to people all the time.  Perhaps a limitation on de  minimus gifts would be more accurate.  Also, a reference to our Code of  Ethics may work here.  In Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value,  or does it include equity grants that vest over time?  A reference to ""cash""  payments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock  options/restricted stock that vest over time.  In Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates  vesting -- Pat, do you know?  Should Section 7.3 be italicized?  I have not seen the latest of the Employee  Matters Agreement.  Have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in Texas for the  purposes of dispute resolution?  Anne, let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any  other questions.

Some interesting reading. Although it doesn't explicitly relate to  foreign assignments, I am aware that our assignments to and from Europe are  predominately white males and I am assuming that this is the case globally as  well.  I am sure that if Enron was ever filed with a lawsuit for  discrimination, this could be an area that would negatively affect the  outcome of Enron's defence as foreign assignments generally provide career  development opportunities that most non-white males at Enron are missing out  on.

This case will be watched very  closely because 1) it was filed against Microsoft, and 2) because of the  large potential class of plaintiffs.

Please feel free to share this with your management.  ````````````````````````````````````````````````   No. 200 Monday, October 16, 2000 Page A-3 ISSN 1522-5968  News    Discrimination Suit  Filed by Microsoft Salaried Employee Alleges Discrimination Based on Race, Sex     SEATTLE--A suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp. alleging the company  maintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African  American and female salaried employees, affecting pay rates and promotion  opportunities (Donaldson v. Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P,  10/4/00).  Such discrimination at the company ""is the standard operating procedure,"" the  lawsuit said.   The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job  benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about  400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees.   Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate  discrimination of any kind.   ""We take these kinds of issues very seriously,"" Murray said regarding the  lawsuit. The company has an ""active diversity policy"" and seeks to recruit  and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could  not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit.   The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who  worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former  African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct.  4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint  said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26  percent are women.   Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including  21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft  employees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said.   The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The  named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of  all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female  salaried employees at Microsoft.   ""African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely  subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting  the terms and conditions of their employment"" at the company, the complaint  said. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil  Rights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are ""systemic in nature,  and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's  operations,"" the lawsuit maintains.    'Excessive Subjectivity' Alleged  The complaint said the company allows ""excessive subjectivity"" in decisions  involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against  employees in the class who complained ""either internally or externally about  Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving  unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating  them.""   The lawsuit said the company ""uses an excessively subjective evaluation  system"" that allows managers ""who are predominantly white males, to rate  employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.""  Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scal, but scores of  five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the  company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each  score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said.   ""Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a  certain number of them must still receive the lower scores."" Any employee  with a 2.5 score is placed on a ""personal improvement plan"" or asked to  resign, the complaint said.   ""Stack rankings"" are used to rank employees in the same job category and  organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be  ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically  higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said.   ""Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal  popularity with other managers"" because the rankings mix employees working  for different managers.   In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company  also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries  ""substantially lower"" than those paid white males doing similar work, with  the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit  said.   Furthermore, ""excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria"" are applied in  promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African  Americans and female employees.

I think the following would be a fair offer for both of them.  Additional 15,000.  This would give Paskoff and additional 2.5 months salary  and Cirino almost 2 months salary.  This get them closer to the 12-13 months  pay they are both asking for.  Plus, Michelle brought up a point about them  incurring attorney's fees and this should well cover it. Payment of their COBRA premiums through the term of their MG contract ( 9 mos  ) No  on the bonus payments No on waiving or reducing the non solicitation of customers, unless Hutch  want's to accommodate this.

We are obligated under the confidentiality agreement that Enron has signed to  keep all information provided to us confidential and to return all  information, including any reproductions, at the end of this process.  Therefore, I ask that where possible you minimize photocopying (we have  EB2943 set aside for our exclusive use) and let me know what photocopies you  have made.  Based on the management presentations and other information available we have  changed the scope for our potential acquisition of the GP assets. We will:  Proceed with the Leaf River mill with the expectation of submitting a binding  bid  Perform some additional due diligence to determine whether we should further  pursue the Woodland mill, and Not pursue the Brunswick mill.  Given the altered scope no work is required in evaluating Brunswick. By Oct.  1st we will decide whether to submit a bid for Woodland. GP still requires  that binding bids be submitted by mid-November and this date will apply to  both Leaf River and Woodland. Regardless of the delayed decision with respect  to Woodland we have little time to understand the issues/risks and to  conclude on the impact on whether Enron would want to own these assets and at  what cost.   We want your feedback as soon as possible so that we can incorporate that  information into the internal management approval process and consequently  the bid(s) that we will be submitting. Our current schedule has the  management approval process beginning on November 9th.  If you have any questions, please contact me.

"My understanding now on this is that we are talking about the Bridgeline  deal.  In that deal, Enron and Texaco both assigned employees to work for the  Bridgeline entity.  It is done under a secundment arrangement, and the  employees are sent there via an assignment letter.   (Pat, you may recall  that we visited about this process a while back, although I may not have  given you the transaction name at the time).

First he has the Enron Corporate indemnity that will pay for  his defence and any judgements according to the indemnity agreement (between  him and Enron) He needs to see the indemnity agreement given him when he  became an officer.   The insurance policy will reimburse Enron for the  defence and judgements made against the officer paid under the indemnity  .   To recap the officer should be provided a copy of the Corporate Indemnity and  a summary page of the D&O policy.    If it were me I would be very comfortable with an Enron Indemnity in my hands  and the D&O insurance  as back up.     The indemnity is very broad.  There  may even be things that the Corporation has agreed to pay for that the D&O  policy does not.

No. 200 Monday, October 16, 2000 Page A-3 ISSN 1522-5968  News    Discrimination Suit  Filed by Microsoft Salaried Employee Alleges Discrimination Based on Race, Sex     SEATTLE--A suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp. alleging the company  maintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African  American and female salaried employees, affecting pay rates and promotion  opportunities (Donaldson v. Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P,  10/4/00).  Such discrimination at the company ""is the standard operating procedure,"" the  lawsuit said.   The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job  benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about  400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees.   Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate  discrimination of any kind.   ""We take these kinds of issues very seriously,"" Murray said regarding the  lawsuit. The company has an ""active diversity policy"" and seeks to recruit  and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could  not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit.   The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who  worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former  African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct.  4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint  said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26  percent are women.   Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including  21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft  employees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said.   The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The  named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of  all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female  salaried employees at Microsoft.   ""African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely  subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting  the terms and conditions of their employment"" at the company, the complaint  said. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil  Rights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are ""systemic in nature,  and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's  operations,"" the lawsuit maintains.    'Excessive Subjectivity' Alleged  The complaint said the company allows ""excessive subjectivity"" in decisions  involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against  employees in the class who complained ""either internally or externally about  Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving  unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating  them.""   The lawsuit said the company ""uses an excessively subjective evaluation  system"" that allows managers ""who are predominantly white males, to rate  employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.""  Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scale, but scores of  five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the  company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each  score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said.   ""Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a  certain number of them must still receive the lower scores."" Any employee  with a 2.5 score is placed on a ""personal improvement plan"" or asked to  resign, the complaint said.   ""Stack rankings"" are used to rank employees in the same job category and  organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be  ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically  higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said.   ""Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal  popularity with other managers"" because the rankings mix employees working  for different managers.   In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company  also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries  ""substantially lower"" than those paid white males doing similar work, with  the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit  said.   Furthermore, ""excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria"" are applied in  promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African  Americans and female employees.

"Sorry about the earlier email!   The following contains a summary of  high-level employment/labor issues based  upon the review of the documents in the data room here in Houston.  We still  need to have a conference call with the HR team at GP to ascertain the  climate of labor relations and other employment issues.  Woodland  1.  Employment Claims:  In the list of insurance matters, there are several  employment-related claims.  Those include sexual harassment allegations,  disability discrimination, retaliation, and mistreatment.  It is unclear  whether those are ongoing claims or not.  I would question whether the mill  has had harassment prevention training, and if so, when.  Also, are there  other employment claims that are not identified in the documents?      2. Labor Union matters:  Rick Johnson is going to review the collective  bargaining agreements.   I am waiting on a list of union grievances, which is  supposed to be forwarded to me today.  3.  I saw nothing about employment contracts, change of control agreements,  or other documents that may require a buyer to provide benefits after closing  for either Woodland.  Leaf River   1.  Litigation Summary:  The company provided a summary of litigation.  Three  of the four are personal injury claims -- one is a fall down stairs by a  delivery person (settled on 7/14/00); another is a contract employee who was  injured when a propane truck on a forklift exploded in his face, and the  third is another contract employee who fell down some stairs (settled  7/27/00).  The fourth is a race discrimination claim from 1991, which has  been on hold due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy.  The summary states that the  corporate law department has more details about the personal injury claims.   We may want to obtain more detailed information as we proceed in this  transaction.  Are there other litigation matters or pending claims?  (E.g.,  EEOC).  2.  No employment contracts.  I saw nothing about change of control  agreements or other documents that may require a buyer to provide  post-closing payments.  3.  Workers Comp:  There are several workers comp claims for 1999 and 1998.   I would suggest that our risk/insurance groups review these claims to make  sure that they are not unusual.  Dee Lenfest is going to review the material on employee benefits and should  provide a separate analysis on that topic.

We should probably look carefully at  their current jobs to determine if they are DOT-covered or not.  If they are  performing DOT-covered jobs, their employer should be required to have a DOT  Drug and Alcohol Testing program, if not it is not necessary to test them on  a random basis.  The only random testing this company allows is for  DOT-covered  and safety sensitive employees in NEPCO and OEC.  Also we have  no means to test employees from other companies since our random selection is  accomplished through our payroll system, nor do we want to be in the business  of testing other's employees.

In other words if I resigned in 4 years (and assuming  no further service contract had been put in place) the company could prevent  me taking another job for upto 3 months after the termination if there was  pay for that period.  Two other points; The new paragraph in 3.4 could be read to infer that the Monthly Base Salary  for the non-compete period would be paid up-front. Would it be safer to pay  monthly conditional upon compliance with the obligations? Have we thought about the enforcability of the 12 month non-compete for  resignations during the term? This is not a concern to me and I am content  with the existing arrangement for my contract. However, as a far as the  precedent is concerned I would like a provision we could definitely enforce.

I do have one observation about the call. While I don't know anything about the transaction, the conversation about employment and benefits would have been facilitated if Enron had previously submitted a written schedule of all of the documents and information Enron required in completing its due diligence review, and used that written schedule to make reference to the data that has not yet been received.  Enron should not let the other side's data schedule or lack of a complete schedule control Enron's due diligence agenda.  Enron should know in advance what information it wants and use a check off sheet to manage the due diligence process.  That way, the other side will better understand what Enron expectations are.  I use this kind of data management tool all of the time and it is very helpful to be able to refer to when it was presented to the other side, how long they have had it and what items are still missing.

"Felicia,  This is a merchant asset, which we currently own 100%, but plan to sell down  in the coming months.  It absolutely has separate HR functions from Enron --  they do not participate in Enron benefits, and we are working hard to prevent  any claims that we could be a joint employer with it.    Thoughts?  Michelle        Enron North America Corp.    From:  Felecia Acevedo @ ENRON                           11/02/2000 08:56 AM    To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Privileged and Confidential communication to my attorneys    Michelle,  who is GSP?  Are they a legal entity?  Are they on our payroll?   If they are we filed EEO-1's for them.    Below is the criteria to file an  EEO-1 report:  Standard Form 100 must be filed by -  A.  All private employers who are: (1) subject to Title VII of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 (as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of  1972) with 100 or more employees EXCLUDING State and local governments,  primary and secondary school systems, institutions of higher education,  Indian tribes and tax-exempt private membership clubs other than labor  organizations; OR (2) subject to Title VII who have fewer than 100 employees  if the company is owned or affiliated with another company, or there is  centralized ownership, control or management (such as central control of  personnel policies and labor relations) so that the group legally constitutes  a single enterprise, and the entire enterprise employs a total of 100 or more  employees.   B.  All federal contractors (private employers), who: (1) are not exempt as  provided for by 41 CFR 60-1.5, (2) have 50 or more employees, and (a) are  prime contractors or first-tier subcontractors, and have a contract,  subcontract, or purchase order amounting to $50,000 or more; or (b) serve as  a depository of Government funds in any amount, or (c) is a financial  institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds and  Notes.   All multi-establishment employers, i.e. employers doing business at more than  one establishment, must file: (1) a report covering the principal or  headquarters office; (2) a separate report for each establishment employing  50 or more persons; (3) a consolidated report that MUST include ALL employees  by race, sex and job category in establishments with 50 or more employees as  well as establishments with fewer than 50 employees; and (4) a list, showing  the name, address, total employment and major activity for each establishment  employ-ing fewer than 50 persons, must accompany the consolidated report.  All forms for a multi-establishment company must be collected by the  headquarters office for its establishments or by the parent corporation for  its subsidiary holdings and submitted in one package.  For the purposes of this report, the term parent corporation refers to any  corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so  that the latter stands in the relation to it of a subsidiary.  The OFCCP has always held that subsidiary companies that do not have direct  govt contracts must comply with AAP regulations if the parent company or  other subsidiary companies benefit from government contracts.  Their line of  thought is that the subsidiary without government contracts benefits  indirectly from the contract as well.   If GSP is completely free standing  and they do not participate in Enron's benefits, abide by our policies or  procedures , participate in our bonus process that may partially or wholly be  funded by Enron Corp. , etc., they may have some type of argement not to  comply  but I doubt it.  If we own them over 51% I don't see a way they could  not file EEO-1's and have an AAP.  We do all the AAP's in Corporate so if  this is a freestanding Business Unit I need to know.   Thanks!  Felecia      Michelle Cash@ECT 11/01/2000 07:49 PM To: Felecia Acevedo/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:    Subject: Privileged and Confidential communication to my attorneys  Felicia,  Does this sound right to you?

Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do      sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal      government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier'      contractor.  (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I      have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him      today.)  Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to      abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors.       Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare      affirmative action plans.  In addition, we do not feel that we are      subject to an OFCCP audit.       Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not      included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's      status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1      and AAPs.

"Fran, any word from Nancy?  Thanks.  Michelle  ---------------------- Forwarded by Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT on 11/14/2000 11:12  PM ---------------------------   Michelle Cash 11/02/2000 05:17 PM To: Timothy J Detmering/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anne C Koehler/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patrick  Wade/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Fran L Mayes/HOU/ECT@ECT, fmackin@aol.com, David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Project Triple Lutz -- HR Issues with Bidder D  This email summarizes my conversation on employee matters with Nancy Quigg  Young, which took place  yesterday.  Logistics.  The most significant area for the employee matters involves the  logistics of the buyer hiring the employees.  In the original agreement that  we proposed, we would allow the buyer to interview employees, select the ones  they wanted to hire, and require that the buyer keep them employed for at  least 2 years.  Their counter proposal was that they got to hire who they  wanted, have us pay severance on all others, and they would have no  obligation to keep them for any length of time.  Since then, there have been discussions internally that we want all employees  to go with the sale, with the buyer taking the action of severing employees  (although we would fund severance costs under the Enron formula).  I raised  that proposal with Nancy, who is going to discuss it with her business  clients.    In the alternative, if the buyer selects the people it hires, and we have to  eliminate the jobs for those not selected, I informed her that we would  require an indemnity for claims made against us based on the selection  process.    Base Salary.  The counteroffer made by Bidder D does not provide that the  employees hired from HPL would receive at least the same base salary as they  earn at Enron.  This is important because a severance payment could be due if  an employee does not accept a job at a lower salary.  Karen appeared  unwilling to agree to pay divested employees outside of the buyer's salary  bands (note:  paying outside of a salary band in the context of an  acquisition is standard procedure, but she was acting as if it were an  incredibly difficult accomplishment).  She claimed that one problem lies in  not knowing the exact salary for each employee at issue.  We pushed back on  this and offered to provide average salaries for each job level, to allow her  to get comfortable with the ranges.  Fran Mayes will provide this  information, which may eliminate this issue.  Bonus.  In our proposal, we asked that the hired employees receive a total  bonus payment that is at least equal to what they earned their last year at  Enron.  Bidder D did not provide any such guarantee.  Karen said that she  needed our ""bonus formula"" before she could commit to this.  I explained that  we have no bonus formula and that our bonuses are based on performance of the  company and the individual.  We previously had provided total bonus amounts  for the entire group, and she could make a determination of bonus costs on a  consolidated basis for her deal folks to calculate.  j  She said she was ""not sure if they could get there"" on the bonus issue,  particularly since she thinks our bonuses will be extra high this year.  I  offered to discuss whether we could modify the amounts by averaging the last  two years, which she thought might make it better.    Unvested Equity.  When I explained to her that we could not supervest  unvested options, she indicated that there was a ""possibility"" that the  amount could be made up in stock options of Bidder D.  I think this is the  ""win-win"" position, but I think it will have to be pushed.  Vacation.  Their vacation plan maxes out at 4 weeks; ours maxes out at 5  weeks.  She thinks she may be able to propose that, for the first year the  employees work for the buyer, they can use the vacation accrual from Enron,  but after that, they are subject to the buyer's vacation plan.  This approach  is reasonable.  WARN Act.  There is the slight possibility of WARN Act implications, in the  unlikely event that closing occurs within 60 days of signing.  The WARN  Act  requires a company to give employees 60 days notice of a plant closing or  mass layoff.  This situation probably would qualify.  Thus, we would have to  give 60 days notice to all employees who potentially may be affected.  We can  pay in lieu of notice, in the event that the closing (and thus the  terminations) occur sooner than 60 days after closing, but we may want to  spell out who bears that cost, if it is incurred.  Benefits.  Other than the vacation benefit described above, it appears that  Bidder D has benefits that generally are of the same nature as Enron's  benefits.  Thus, allowing the hired employees to participate in the buyer's  benefits plans, with credit for years of service at Enron, likely would be  comparable to their situations here.  I expect that we will hear from Bidder D with their proposals on these issues  once Fran provides Nancy with the salary data.  Please let me know if you  have any questions.

I know you are in the process of getting the NDA completed, but I don't want our progress to be held up by the legal process.  In our last meeting, there were several documents shown that you had not seen in the past.  Attached, you will find the documents you requested.  Business Model Overview The ""business model.ppt"" file contains the slides describing how iGeneration is creating web professionals and the web job role certificatons/skill sets. Please let me know if you have any questions.  Project Manager Resource As an enterprise partner, an Project Manager will be assigned to Enron. This person is a resource of iGeneration and will be responsible for implementing the solution.  The ""project manager.doc"" file should provide you with an overview of the project manager's roles and responsibilities.  Pricing Model The ""iGeneration TalentLink Pricing Grid.doc"" will outline standard pricing and features model.  Please keep in mind, the pricing model does not account for training, so modifications will have to be made as we progress.  Skill Set Analysis We have reveiwed all of the web related job reqs listed on Enron's career web site, and aligned them to iGeneration certifications.  It is quite compelling how the two align.  I look forward to sharing this information with you.  I know you wanted to see a detailed version of our certification skill sets. The files are quite large, so I only included a couple.

"Hoyt,  If GSP LLC  would assume the liability at the time of return, why would it  risk bringing them back for light duty work?  Why not wait until they are  fully released, particularly if one of them is going to sue under workers  comp scheme?

We would like to bring them back to      do light-duty work, to get them in the swing of working again and also      to get some adminstrative work done.       I am concerned that bringing these employees back to work on light      duty will cause these cases to become an Enron liability rather than      an MG liability. I discussed this with Pat McCarthy, the labor and      employment law attorney we are using in NJ, and he said that the      liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought      them back . . . it would still be an MG liability, UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE      HURT HIMSELF AGAIN.  In which case, GSP owns it.       However, Pat said that a lot of what determines the ownership of the      worker's comp cases is written into the purchase and sale agreement.      He said that there may be language that addresses an employee's return      to work from worker's comp.  I know that we have an ongoing dispute      about worker's comp with MG at this point.

"David,  I think this point is moot for the time being because (as of last Tuesday) we  are not dealing with Bidder D.  I think it is ok legally to go this way -- although there is potential  liability under the WARN Act (the plant closing law).  We probably can  schedule around that exposure, though, by giving everyone who possibly may be  affected 60 days' notice.   Practically, however, this would not be my favorite approach.  I'd prefer it  if we could have the ability to compete for top performers, but we should be  able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and  present for possible hiring by the buyer.    I would like more information about what is meant by ""ENA does not interfere  with"" the offers made by the buyer.  Does that mean no counteroffers?   To answer the question of whether we can bind all of Enron, I would say that  it is unlikely, unless we want to ask.  It is easier to commit only the  wholesale group, rather than ask Corp., EES, Broadband, etc.  whether they  will abide by the agreement, so I would recommend limiting it to that group,  if possible.  We may be able to include the pipelines, given that they have  been involved in this transaction.  Let me know if you have any questions.

I would like to  propose something like the following:   1.  We provide Bidder D with a list of all Designated Employees, their  position, historical compensation.  2.  Bidder D covenants to make offers to ___% of certain pools of Designated  Employees e.g. commercial, operations, engineering, trading, etc.  3.  Bidder D covenants to make offers that will not allow Designated  Employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance  plan.  4.  Between signing and closing, Bidder D provide us with a list of Offerees  - Designated Employees to whom Bidder D intends to make offers of     employment.  5.  ENA covenants that we will not interfere with Bidder D's offers (can we  bind all of Enron?).  6.  If an Offeree turns down the offer (in writing) then ENA is free to  continue to employee Offeree.  However, if we do not continue to employ the  Offeree, no   severance is owed.   The intent of the above is to encourage Offerees to take the offers - they  give up severance rights if they don't - but provide us the opportunity to  continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we  want to keep.  Also it caps our severance obligation by requiring Bidder D to  specify how many offers must be made.  Bidder D is certain to want more than  this but I am uncomfortable saying we can't continue to employee any of the  Offerees.  Please advise.

Thanks.  Michelle    Transactions  Major Events of September - November 2000  Garden State Paper -- closing and transition.  Triple Lutz -- issues surrounding potential divestiture, including internal  discussions, review of data requests and responses, review and comment on  both PSA documents, negotiations with both buyer's representatives, and  discussions with clients.  Issues include salaries of employees hired by  buyer (effect of Enron severance plan), other benefits for divested employees  (including unvested stock options, insurance, vacation, etc.), process for  divesture, payment of severance obligations, possible redeployment, etc.  Crane -- monitor due diligence, PSA review and comment, client discussions.  Falcon -- review diligence reports, client discussions.  E2  -- limited involvement in PSA and schedule review, data requests.   Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  Triple Lutz -- continued negotiations and document drafting.  Transition  issues for divestiture will continue to be significant.  Litigation by  persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not  to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible.  East Coast Power:  If we sell our interest in ECP, there will be many  transition issues due to Enron's providing benefits, payroll, etc. for ECP  personnel.  Also, there will be transition issues for other services,  including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP.  Crane/Falcon -- could move forward; Crane is more likely.  Issues of labor  unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues.   Litigation  Major Events of September - November 2000  No employee-initiated litigation for 2000.  Non-compete litigation:  Currently, suit pending against Alonzo Williams in  Sharolyn Wood's court.  Suit filed, no TRO sought.  Service in process.  Minor litigation:  Marentz & Co. v. Enron.  Suit for non-payment of placement  fee.  Maximum damages $75K.  Discovery period ends this week, court-ordered  mediation to follow.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect that we will be filing non-compete litigation in February and March,  as people leave after they are paid their bonuses.    We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non-compete litigation.    Documents Generated  Major Events of September - November 2000  New Consulting Services Agreement:  I prepared a new form of Consulting  Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work  Description for Net Works contract personnel. I received minor comments from  outside counsel as well as client group feedback.  I will finalize the  agreement, so that the new document can go into effect on 1/1/01.    Standard Agreements:  I prepared:    ___ draft employment agreements.   ___ draft consulting services agreements.    ___ separation agreement and releases.   ___ retention letter agreements.  The number of employment agreements seems low to me, particularly in  trading.  My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person  in trading under contract, but wants to wait and see how they perform.  There  are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our  non-compete provisions.   Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect that, after bonus amounts are announced, there will be a flurry of  contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus  pool.    Investigations  Major Events of September - November 2000  Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations:  I  directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the  company decided to employ them.  I and the team reviewed the results with  Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of  the consultants' surveys.  Sally Beck is contemplating communication to  employees on results of survey.  [Other proposals can be discussed verbally.]  Texaco Hacker:  We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the  Texaco computer system using an ID of a former co-worker.  He then sent  inappropriate emails to her co-workers, posing as her.  The investigation  results led to termination of employment for cause.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated  following PRC/bonus discussions.    Training  Major Events of September - November 2000   Increased role as trainer.  I provided interview training for all Net Works  employees who are involved in the Technology Track (about 10 sessions).    Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001    EIM:  Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials  Group.  The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition  of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family.    All of Wholesale:  The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated  early next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months.  Refresher  training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went  through the first round.  Pre-Hire Testing   Major Events of September - November 2000  Many Wholesale groups are looking at pre-employment testing as a method of  screening out applicants.  I am working with the Training and Development  groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards.  I have suggested  experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests  will result in a successful employee.  Re-Skilling:  One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of  potential employees who may be re-skilled to perform IT jobs working under  Beth Perlman.   Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  I expect the testing issue to continue to be hot, particularly since John  Lavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the A&A  program.   Employee Relations/Terminations    Much of my time is spent providing advice on employee relations/termination  issues -- approximately 10-15 per week (total).  No two situations are alike,  and they require significant time.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  After PRC/bonus time, this area of practice will be exceptionally busy.  The  company will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on  a performance improvement plan.  Generally, I review those before they are  put in place.  If they are not successful, then terminations are likely  (probably early in the first half of 2001).  Those issues are time-consuming  and full of risks.  Work for Portfolio Assets  Major Events of September - November 2000  Ecogas:  wind-down issues.  Mariner:  Change of Control Agreements.  CGAS:  harassment prevention training -- arranged for Littler, Mendelson to  provide training for CGAS personnel.  East Coast Power:  Agreements, advice and counselling on various issues.  Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  CGAS:  Revising employment agreements for key personnel.  Mariner:  Employment agreement negotiation.   Conclusions   ENA:  ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of  manager and above.  I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring.  Lavorato has  placed processes in place for hiring at that level, including the requirement  of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of  manager or above.    Salaries need to be reviewed for equity (by gender as well as by race).  Net Works:  Net Works has hired over 800 employees and contractors in 2000.   I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be  managed out.  Generally, the IT personnel are not the best about counselling  and documentation, so there may be significant work to be done to  ensure  that risks are managed in that situation.  I have seen improvement in that  group working with HR, and they have invited me to conduct training, so it  may improve over time.  Contractors are another issue at Net Works.  A significant portion of the  work force is contract personnel.  Microsoft issues could arise if  contractors are allowed to stay on too long.  Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue.  Net Works has too many  employees in the ""exempt"" category who should be classified as ""non-exempt.""   I have raised this issue with HR, and they are working through it.  It will  not be an easy fix.  EIM:  The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of  talent as well as M&A activity.  HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle  diligence for EIM, but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle  the job.    EGM:  EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other  groups within Wholesale.  That, plus the added earnings pressures, will make  retention of key personnel essential.  I expect to see continued pressure to  shorten the non-compete duration for this group. ",twanda.sweet@enron.com,michelle.cash@enron.com,Quarterly Business Review,2000-11-26 18:00:00-08:00,sent

I don't agree to all the terms in here, and I really don't want to spend a lot of time with ELT to negotiate the agreement.  For example, the part where we will be billed for developmental costs if we cancel within a certain period of time.  From my perspective, that is inappropriate since I spent more time than ELT on developing this product, and  you are simply delivering a product that you and I already prepared and completed on several occasions across North America.  There will be one new scripted section, but that should be from the actors, and it should not be significant.  Also, there are not appropriate confidentiality provisions, etc.  So, I would have to negotiate it with ELT for it to be acceptable to us.  The last time, you just billed for time, and the actors billed separately. I prefer that approach, if we can do it that way.  If I am being a major prima donna and it creates a big problem for you internally, let me know, and I can review it and comment back to ELT.  Thanks.

"Michelle -  Since this deal is beginning to heat up again, I wanted to get you back in  the loop.  The earlier e-mail is a good overview of the structure proposed  for ownership.  Some minor movement of employees may be required, but it is  not anticipated at this time that many, if any, employees will be  terminated.  A few key individuals have change of control severance  agreements, but overall there is no change of control trigger affecting the  employee base.   I have attached a copy of the Legal Risk Memo I provided to Mark H. in  advance of approvals.  It contains a summary of the deal and a general  outline of the identified issues, including two related to pension issues in  Quebec.

He is his usual self today  (happily -- he was kind of a pest this weekend --  you really saw him at his  worst, unfortunately).  We watched How the Grinch Stole Christmas today on  the Cartoon Network, and he was happy as can be.

Thomas at GARFIELD Date:    11/3/00 7:17 AM        Jim Burkhead: Dave (Syracuse) and Marty (Miami Ohio) are both going to      campus on the 14th.  If you could move your date at Maine up to that      week from the 29th, then we could convene after all three interview      trips and decide who we want to bring on-site.       I propose (based on Marty's suggestion) that we try to bring all our      leading candidates in for a mill visit on the same day (or perhaps one      day for Dec grads and one day for May grads, if we get that many      interested candidates), preferably the last week of November.  It will      be a busy day, but then we can knock it all out then.       Regarding your campus visits, we are looking for at least two process      engineers, December grads are fine (actually preferred at the present      time), and we should also look at environmental engineers if they are      available at the school you are visiting.  In order to hire two      process engineers, we probably have to bring eight in for a mill      visit.       Margo, is there any way we can get some GSPCLLC brochures or handouts      for Jim, Mary and Dave to use on campus?  FYI, Houston Legal is recommending that we do not emphasize the Enron connection.  I think that we are probably okay with the reference to Enron in the attached blurb that Marty and Dave put together (attached) but let's avoid suggesting to candidates that they can hire on here and then move into Enron. Jim and Marty, when you send the attached doc to campus, you might want to add your name at the bottom in addition to Dave's to make sure that the students  know that they can contact you.  David Howe and Mike Parker, do you want to go to any of these campus visits?

I have taken that agreement and redrafted it to provide for direct  representations and warranties from the Banks to Enron regarding such issues  as title, status of contracts, financial statements, and otherwise.  This agreement should be viewed as a preliminary draft only as I did not have  the benefit of reviewing the schedules which will form part of the  agreement.  I understand those schedules are being prepared and will be  forwarded to us together with a possibly revised version of this agreement.   Also coming over is a form of debt purchase agreement.  Once I have received those agreements and have had an opportunity to review  them together with their schedules I expect further changes will result.   Further changes may also result from the continuation of due diligence  through the course of this week and next.  However, I think the enclosed is a dramatic improvement from Enron's  perspective over the form of purchase and sale agreement proposed by KPMG.  I look forward to discussing this with you.

"Hello!  An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.  There have been  three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.  The topic is  technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.  In this 4th  edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own  time.  However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously  would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the  book.  She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary  information, however.  What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?  She is  willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not  think that would be worthwhile.  My opinion at this point is that she can do  it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of  course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific  information.  I welcome  your perspective, however, given that this is a new one to me.  Thanks for your thoughts.

Again, I  was able to contact Rodney Tow, and Tow reported to me that he spoke with Joe  Walker of TMAC this morning and told him that Enron did not want him at the  party.  Tow will follow that up with a note to Walker.  I believe Walker's confusion was created by Diane Neilsen.  Before he called  Walker, Tow read to me a telefax that Neilsen had sent to Walker after  hearing from Tow that we did not want Walker at the party.  The fax simply  said that Enron did not want any type of religious orientation in the show,  but never said that Enron didn't want him at the party.  I also asked Walker how he was doing on getting our security in place.  Tow,  who had just walked into the office when I called, said that he was working  on it, that he had just received a letter from Neilsen regarding it (which he  apparently had not read), and that he had to let me go because he had clients  on the line.  On another note:  I received a copy of a transmittal memorandum from Kriste  Sullivan to Mike Rosen, which attaches an unexecuted copy of a confidential  draft of the Master Consulting Services Agreement between Enron Corp. and  Event Resources Inc. in this matter.  Kriste says in the memo that her  records do not indicate that execution copies were prepared.  The signature blanks are for Mark Palmer of Corp. and Ken Price of ERI (who  has left).  I was going to try to interview Price anyway regarding such  things as where ERI kept its money, whether he believed that when he signed  the Hilton agreement he was signing as an agent, and other matters.  I can  also ask him if he ever signed any master agreement with Enron.  What do you  think?

Based on the recitals for this transaction, and other provisions of the Agreement (Sections 7 and 10) it appears that the employee benefit plans are not excluded.  Generally, when such employee benefit plans are included in an asset transaction, the buyer wants to obtain representations as to the funding, compliance and administration of the plans.  These kinds of representations are not in the Agreement.  The bottom line is that the buyer needs to rely on Canadian counsel and actuaries to gives buyer the level of comfort it desires to have with respect to these issues of funding, compliance and administration so that they can be inserted into the financial model for determining the offering price.  You may wish to obtain a formal opinion letter from the Canadian counsel and actuary regarding the level of comfort the buyer requires.

Since the requirements of the Pay Equity Act have  not been identified to management as a concern, I need to ensure that this is  a real issue (mostly from a $'s exposure standpoint) vs. something so remote  that it should not even be discussed.  Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

S. domestic employee transfers  occur between Enron BUs.   The current situation results in significant  Enron excess OASDI payment  annually, and creates issues with employee due to overwithholding resulting  in employee complaints and ill will towards HR, Payroll, and Enron.  The  document depicts apparent options, and a potential solution, to the current  situation.  This is viewed as an HR customer service issue to ensure Enron  employees receive the best overall service possible in their interface to the  HR function and systems.   It is my understanding that Enron Executive Management feel that employee  transferability among the BUs is important, and wishes to see more movement  of employees (as well as thoughts and ideas) between the BUs in the future to  enhance employee opportunities and Enron's value.  This being the case, I  would expect the Enron cost and employee impacts and issues to be acerbated  as additional and increased employee movement occurs in the future.    We need Legal review of the issues and opportunities as presented in the  document to determine a solution to the current - and pending future -  situation, and look forward to any guidance you can provide in resolving the  problems the current situation creates for Enron employees who transfer  between Enron entities within a tax year and to mitigate potential future  issues.    If there is not a Legal obstacle, we will then go to Tax to address the  specific tax entity issues.

"Michelle, ? Sorry, I should have been more clear on the 4 - 6 % vacation  pay. That is  the statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act. It  applies to  non-union employees. It only applies to union employees if the  equivalent  provisions in the collective agreement do not ""meet or exceed"" the  Act's  provisions. Since the collective agreement's provisions are better than  the  provisions in the Act, the Act's vacation pay provisions do not apply to   union employees. ? In terms of the payment schedule, for union employees the  collective  agreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at the start of  the  year. I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for non-union employees, but   I'll check on that. When their actual time for vacation comes up, they may   actually have to take that time off without any pay if they've already  elected  to take the pay earlier. ? For both union and non-union employees, vacation pay is earned  and accrued  in one year and paid out the next. So in 2001, all Celgar employees  will be  entitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of their 2000  earnings. ? With respect to the standard employment contract, there really  isn't one,  save for the letter of employment that KPMG sent out to all  employees. The  letter from KPMG to Doug Cargill is a sample. It was in the  package I sent  on Friday last week. If you don't have it, please let me know and  I'll send  it. ? There are also position descriptions for every union and  non-union employees  that are given to the employees upon hiring. These might  also be considered  part of the contract of employment, though they are not  incorporated into a  letter of employment. ? Hope that answers your questions. Please let me know if I may  be of further  assistance. ? Dean  >>>  <Michelle.Cash@enron.com> 12/11/00 01:25PM >>>  Thanks,  Dean.  Two questions have arisen based upon your diligence  summary:  1.?

Just in case y'all didn't have the opportunity to discuss  it, I did get names from her of those with whom she had previously worked.  She was hired at Enron by Jim Hughes, and is currently working with Bruce  Lundstrom.  She has also worked with Anthony Duenner, who is now commercial,  but who was at B&P and worked on the PGE acquisition.  At Reboul, MacMurray she worked with John MacMurray and Isabelle Barzun, but  all of the attorneys with whom she worked at Milbank have since left the firm.  Hope this is what you needed...

Sorry, I should have been more clear on the 4 - 6 % vacation  pay. That is  the statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act. It  applies to  non-union employees. It only applies to union employees if the  equivalent  provisions in the collective agreement do not ""meet or exceed"" the  Act's  provisions. Since the collective agreement's provisions are better than  the  provisions in the Act, the Act's vacation pay provisions do not apply to   union employees. ? In terms of the payment schedule, for union employees the  collective  agreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at the start of  the  year. I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for non-union employees, but   I'll check on that. When their actual time for vacation comes up, they may   actually have to take that time off without any pay if they've already  elected  to take the pay earlier. ? For both union and non-union employees, vacation pay is earned  and accrued  in one year and paid out the next. So in 2001, all Celgar employees  will be  entitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of their 2000  earnings. ? With respect to the standard employment contract, there really  isn't one,  save for the letter of employment that KPMG sent out to all  employees. The  letter from KPMG to Doug Cargill is a sample. It was in the  package I sent  on Friday last week. If you don't have it, please let me know and  I'll send  it. ? There are also position descriptions for every union and  non-union employees  that are given to the employees upon hiring.

An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.  There have been  three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.  The topic is  technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.  In this 4th  edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own  time.  However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously  would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the  book.  She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary  information, however.  What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?  She is  willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not  think that would be worthwhile.  My opinion at this point is that she can do  it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of  course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific  information.

TRAVEL DISPATCH offers you a jump on special travel deals and news.  http://email.nytimes.com/email/email.jsp?eta5  \----------------------------------------------------------/  Companies Turn to Grades, and Employees Go to Court   By REED ABELSON  An increasingly popular technique for evaluating employees is prompting lawsuits charging discrimination at three big companies.   At issue is the ranking of managers, professionals and sometimes lower-level employees from best to worst, or grading them on a bell curve, and then using that ranking to help determine pay and sometimes whether to fire someone.   In their suits, all filed over the last year or so, employees at Microsoft, Ford Motor and Conoco say the rating systems are unfair because they favor some groups of employees over others: white males over blacks and women, younger managers over older ones and foreign citizens over Americans.   A growing number of companies are turning to grading systems, also known as forced rankings or distributions, as a way of making sure managers evaluate employees honestly and make clearer distinctions among them. At companies that do not compare employees with one another this way, nearly every employee can come away feeling above average, like the children of Lake Wobegon. But under the grading system, managers are forced to identify some people as low performers.   At General Electric, for example, supervisors identify the top 20 percent and bottom 10 percent of their managerial and professional employees every year. The bottom 10 percent are not likely to stay.   As John F. Welch Jr., General Electric's chief executive, wrote last month to shareholders, ""A company that bets its future on its people must remove that lower 10 percent, and keep removing it every year =01* always raising the bar of performance and increasing the quality of its leadership.""   Ranking or grading employees is also common at technology companies like Cisco Systems and Hewlett- Packard. But recently the concept has been catching on more broadly, according to management consultants. One reason is that as the economy slows, companies often lay off employees. Cisco, for example, announced earlier this month that it would let go as many as 5,000 workers =01* and would use grading as one way to identify people to lay off.   ""Companies are playing their version of `Survivor,' "" said David Thomas, a professor at the Harvard Business School.   Another reason is that some companies are eager to copy Mr. Welch, long viewed as one of the most successful managers in America.   Defenders of these systems say anyone who gets a low grade is likely to view the process as unfair. "" `A' students love grades; `F' students hate grades,"" said John Sullivan, a human resources professor at San Francisco State University.   But the techniques, which some employees label with terms like ""rank and yank,"" have come under sharp criticism. While they appear to offer an objective way to judge employees, they can be vulnerable to bias, Mr. Thomas said. Managers may stereotype employees when evaluating them on vague criteria like career potential =01* deciding that older workers, for example, may have a harder time keeping up with new technology.   In some cases managers can view these systems ""as a tool to be used to weed out the ones you don't want,"" said Thomas S. McLeod, a lawyer in Canton, Mich., who represents employees suing Ford in another case.   Critics of the system also argue that companies should not apply a bell curve, in which a small number of employees get the highest and lowest rankings and a much larger number are grouped in the middle. The bell curve model assumes a normal distribution among a very large group of random individuals, not small groups.   What is more, across a company, people who belong to a particularly talented unit will suffer if a certain number of them must be given poorer grades than they would get in another unit.   ""You end up with dysfunctional results,"" said Edward E. Lawler III, a business professor at the University of Southern California.   Some lawsuits contend that Microsoft's grading systems are discriminatory. One, filed last October, seeks class-action status on behalf of blacks and women. The suit states that the rating system ""permits managers, who are predominantly white males, to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.""   According to the lawsuit, employees are rated on a five-point scale, with only a certain percentage permitted to receive each score. Employees doing the same job in the same unit are also given a ""stack ranking,"" from most to least valuable. Managers decide those rankings largely using what are called ""lifeboat discussions,"" where they choose which employees they would want with them if stuck in a lifeboat. Managers had no other clear criteria, according to Christine Webber, a lawyer at Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll who is representing the employees.   Grading is highly subjective at Microsoft, according to Peter M. Browne, a former executive who is also suing the company, charging discrimination. Mr. Browne, who is black, said managers were forced to use a curve in evaluating even small groups. He said he had to rate a group of five on a curve, for example, in deciding which ones would not receive stock options.   ""You weren't told anything =01* just meet the curve,"" Mr. Browne said.   He says managers ended up favoring people with whom they socialized. ""People gravitate to people who are like them, and the system just forces that,"" he said.   Microsoft defends its system as fair and helpful. ""We want to give the highest compensation to the very top performers,"" said Deborah Willingham, senior vice president for human resources, adding that the system included checks and balances to ensure fair treatment. Employees can appeal their ratings, for example, and are largely responsible for developing the criteria by which they are evaluated.   Ms. Willingham also said the company did not ask its managers to give a fixed percentage of their employees any given score. ""We don't force that curve to look any certain way,"" she said.   Microsoft has no formal ""stack rank"" policy, she said. And when managers do have lifeboat discussions, they are a tool to consider which employees they would want to keep if they were starting again.   While the company would not comment on the lawsuits, Microsoft ""expressly prohibits discrimination,"" Ms. Willingham said.   Similar criticisms emerged in a lawsuit brought last month against Ford. It argues that the company's new grading system discriminates against older workers. The company, which adopted what it calls its performance management process a year ago, gives its 18,000 managers A, B or C grades. Last year, the company awarded 10 percent an A, 80 percent a B and 10 percent a C.   Ford also faces a second lawsuit asserting that it unfairly discriminated against older white males in its grading.It would not comment on the litigation but defended its use of grades. ""We believe the system is fair and nondiscriminatory,"" a company spokeswoman said. ""We are in a very competitive industry, and we need all of our employees to be the best they can be.""   At Conoco, employees contend that the company discriminated against United States citizens and older workers when it laid off a dozen geophysicists and other scientists in 1999 based on a ranking from one to four, according to a lawsuit filed last year. The majority of those let go were Americans, according to the suit, as opposed to British, Norwegian and Canadian professionals.   ""The rating system was selectively enforced, and there were instances of manipulation,"" said John Zavitsanos, the lawyer representing the workers. Even though some were given higher ratings on earlier rankings, they were eventually given the lowest possible rating of four.   Conoco, based in Houston, has extensive operations in the North Sea, and many of the senior managers at the division in question are British, according to Mr. Zavitsanos.   While Conoco said it could not comment on the litigation, it said its evaluations were based on several factors, including performance, skills and expertise. The company said ratings often changed as more information was collected and people were evaluated in larger groups. Conoco company also denied that decisions were based on anything other than individual capabilities.   Companies ""do need something in making pay decisions, downsizing decisions,"" said Jim Kochanski, a consultant with Nextera Enterprises. The problem is that companies may not take enough care in deciding how people should be ranked. ""They can get it very wrong,"" he said.            http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/business/19GRAD.html?ex=3D986016138&ei=3D= 1&en=3De2 02a0228246c717  /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

"Hi, Jim.  We had a great group of people working on the CLE committee this year.  The committee was a combination of people identified by the various general counsels, plus people I knew and thought would be reliable volunteers.  I believe that one of the current committee members would be a logical choice to chair next year's law conference CLE program.  (I know that I would have felt a little more confident had I sat on the committee before taking the helm).  Although most of the committee members contributed to the effort, any of  the following lawyers would be strong candidates to chair next year's CLE committee:  Carlos Sole, Rose Engeldorf, Michelle Hicks, Susan Scott, Marianne Castano, Brenda Funk, or Kriste Sullivan.  David Koogler, who was not an active member of the committee, but nonetheless was responsible for a speaker, also would be a good choice (in fact, for some reason, EBS is under the impression that it is next on the list, so David and Michelle would not be surprised if they were tapped for the job -- co-chairs may be a good idea).  Let me know if you have any questions or would like any more information on the committee or other aspects of the law conference CLE program.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, I enjoyed chairing the committee and thank you for the opportunity.

Today we had a post-conference meeting with the group that worked on the conference, and we went over what worked well and what didn't.  It was very productive.  One of the things that came out of our meeting was the need to promptly appoint next year's Chairman of the CLE committee.  Michelle feels that putting that person in place now will greatly aid in the transition from this year to next year's planning.  As a matter of fact, she is meeting with her committee for the last time next week and would love to announce the new chair at that time.  So, could you please think about to whom you would like to give that distinct honor?  I've asked Michelle to e-mail you information about her committee and her suggestions regarding a chair.

"Hi, Felicia.  As I told Cindy, there is no easy way for me to determine which contracts I have done in the past are for corporate versus other business units.  I simply don't organize my documents that way.  Instead, I do a numeric list of documents, and the documents are identified by employee name, as opposed to business unit.  As of now, I have over 4500 documents on that list.  So, I can't easily pull out corporate agreements.  I can say that most of the corporate agreements I have done have been for RAC or Finance, so Sheila Walton probably has kept track of them somehow.  The others most likely were at VP or above level, so I think they have been captured by corporate comp.  I hope that gives you information, even if it doesn't provide exactly what you are looking for.  Let me know if you have questions.

"Gina/David, I think we need to have some guidelines for these types of questions.  My view is that we should encourage people to be contacted while out on leave to identify reviewers and submit a self-evaluation.

Should the supervisor select?  What should we do in terms of the self evaluation of listing 5 accomplishments that will be flashed on the screen during PRC meetings?  Should we just leave theirs blank?  If it is blank will it be viewed as a negative?  Can the supervisor contact the individual at home to ask them who they want for reviewers and what do they want to put for 5 accomplishments?  If the employee knows that we are going through this process and wants to select reviewers and do their accomplishments from home, should we allow that since they are on leave?   Sorry to throw all of these questions at you, but the EES HR group has thrown them at me and I agreed to send you one e-mail to keep from all of us contacting you.

"Please respond to  Michelle,  I hope your week is going well.  Please find attached the resume of Mitch Ludwin. Mitch has great academics (JD '89 cum laude-top 8%, Law Review, Order of the Coif, etc.) and extensive transactions experience with an emphasis on finance. Mitch is currently Senior Associate at Troutman Sanders in Atlanta. Mitch was originally from New York and began his career practicing for three years with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in that City. Mitch then joined Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander Y Ferdon, spending two years with the firm's New York office, followed by a year and a half with the firm's Los Angeles office. Upon dissolution of Mudge, Rose, Mitch joined Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson in Los Angeles.  Mitch then accepted an opportunity with Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, where he practiced four years. Mitch joined the firm to participate in the start up of the firm's project finance practice and to be closer to his wife's family. This area of the firm's practice did not develop as anticipated and the attorneys brought in with this expertise moved to other firms. Mitch joined Troutman to focus on asset-based lending. I would be happy to provide any additional information concerning Mitch which you may wish and to arrange an interview, if you so desire.

I realize that there is some  concern that Wanda is a litigation threat, so for the purposes of soliciting  legal advice and in anticipation of litigation, I am forwarding my  recollection of today's meeting to you:  Wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as ""unfair and  discriminatory"" treatment.  When I asked her what she meant specifically (and  did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning), she said that she  did not intend the legal meaning of those terms;  rather, she, on  a  ""personal"" level,  felt that the company should have treated her better.  She  mentioned specifically: that no one ever called to explain in detail why she  had not been further promoted at Enron or given more responsibility at Enron,  that she viewed the job in Sally Beck's organization as unsatisfactory  (because Sally should be treated as a peer, not a superior), and that she  felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the  company. I described several options for her: Take the job she was offered in Sally Beck's organization; Take the job in Rick Buy's organization (I said I would have to talk to Rick  again) Take severence under the standard package; Take severence as a ""business reorg"" but consult with Enron for a period. At first she seemed most interested in the fourth option (although she wasn't  particularly happy about any of the  alternatives), but at the end of the  discussion expressed interest in the second option. A large part of the conversation involved discussion of Wanda's complaints  about how she had been treated.  Most of Wanda's concerns focussed on jobs  she did not get, or jobs she felt were taken from her, reduced scope of  control, and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate  with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about  job assignments.  I suggested that there were likely two sides to the story  and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some  insensitivity.  I also pointed out that in all my conversations I heard good  things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated  her unfairly. Wanda did complain about many things, but never once complained about her pay  at Enron.  Mary, these are my recollections from today.  Do you have anything to add?

The online site contains the documentation required to meet our regulatory obligations including the AAP narrative, goals and utilization analysis.  We have also included links to critical EEO/AA policies and related information.   We are excited about this opportunity to simplify your access to this critical and important information.   Please reference this web-site when you have an open position that needs to be filled or when considering transferring and promoting employees.   The URL link is listed at the bottom of this message.  Through our Affirmative Action Programs we take positive steps to ensure that we deliver on our commitment to EEO.  Affirmative Action is not about quotas for women or minorities nor is it about preferential treatment to less qualified candidates because of their race, gender, disability or veteran status.  Through affirmative action, we seek to establish a ""level playing field"" for all employees and applicants, regardless of race, gender, disability or veteran status.  We use statistical analyses of employment patterns as indicators of whether the playing field is truly level.  The AAP contains proprietary information, therefore it should not be shared with anyone outside of Enron.  If your operating company is participating in a bidding process where EEO/AAP information is requested, please forward those requests to the corporate Office of Labor & Employee Relations at EB1561 or call (713) 853-3086.  Please refer to Enron's Code of Ethics book for guidance concerning your obligations of confidence with proprietary company information.  Although the AAP contains proprietary information and belongs to Enron Corp., the narrative section is to be made available for review during regular work hours to all job applicants and employees who ask to see it.  We ask that these requests be forwarded through Human Resources and that the web site you are accessing not be shared.  We would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the strong commitment of Enron Corp. to the principle of Equal Employment Opportunity in its personnel policies and practices.  It is our Company policy to recruit, hire, train, and promote into all job levels, the most qualified employees and applicants for employment, without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability, or veteran status.  All employee selections are based on (1) inclusive recruitment and outreach efforts, and the merit, qualifications and competence of individuals for the particular positions, and (2) consistently providing equal employment opportunity.  We believe that a diverse workforce is a strength, and that as we implement personnel policies and practices which foster fair treatment on the basis of race, sex and disability, we promote equitable employment opportunities for all employees and applicants.  Enron administers all personnel programs and employment opportunities without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, pregnancy, national origin, physical or mental disability, veteran status, or status as an alien authorized to work in the United States.  Such employment programs and opportunities include, but are not limited to, compensation, benefits, transfers, layoff, leaves of absence, return from layoff, training, education, tuition assistance, and Company-sponsored social and recreational programs.  We have developed and implemented the 2001 Affirmative Action Program (AAP) to support our commitment to the principle of equal employment opportunity and meet federal and state requirements.  The AAP describes, in detail, the policies and procedures used in the Company's operations to carry out its commitment.  Your company's EEO Officer, as stipulated in your plan narrative, is responsible for administering the Company's Affirmative Action Program and will report to senior management on a continuing basis with regard to the progress being made under the AAP.  If you have questions, comments or concerns about Enron's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action policies, please speak with your supervisor or your Human Resource Representative.  As with any rollout of a new web-site, errors, while not expected, may occur.  Please contact AA Program@enron.com if you are unable to log-in or experience any difficulties.  We would recommend that once you access the site you add it to your ""favorites"" list for future reference.    http://aap.enron.com/default.asp?u=2142&p=VEQIPSML  ",david.oxley@enron.com,michelle.cash@enron.com,Re: FW: 2001 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN,2001-06-01 14:08:00-07:00,sent

The following article appeared in the Chicago Tribune today:  Under a settlement agreement signed with the National Labor Relations Board, Midwest Generation LLC, a wholesale power supplier to Commonwealth Edison Co., will begin negotiating as early as next week with the union representing 1,150 of its electrical workers, officials said. The move comes less than two weeks after the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local authorized a strike. The sides have disagreed over when the current contract expires; under a separate agreement, Midwest Generation was released from its obligation to maintain the existing contract through June 2002, company officials said.  Would there be any way to obtain details about this, or is it probably a confidential settlement? Thanks for the advice.

But, if CRDC defaulted then Chris Cline, Tim Elliott, John Dickinson, and Enron could be responsible for the remaining payments. He believes that if CRDC defaults and the other defendants do not agree among themselves as to the amount and manner in which Clonch will be paid, then Clonch will be required to institute one arbitration action against each of the remaining defendants.  Additionally, he believes that under the agreement the parties did not agree to joint and several liability.  I asked him as to why he allowed his clients to be potentially personally liable on the payments owing to Clonch by CRDC.  He explained that it was a ""no brainer.""  He reasoned that Elliott, Cline, and Dickinson are the chief officers of CRDC and they will do everything in their power to prevent CRDC from defaulting, because they do not want to be subject to personal liability.  Rick also told me that Kevin also agrees with this interpretation.   After speaking with Rick Brown, I spoke to Rich Walters, who informed me that Clonch refused to accept Enron's offer to guarantee payments under the settlement agreement beginning 2002 until 2007 at a maximum of $1000 a month and $12,000 a year. Rich Walters told me Karen Miller's interpretation of the handwritten settlement agreement.  Her interpretation is in accord with Rick Brown's interpretation.  For these reasons, only intends to sue Enron and not Cline, Elliott, and Dickinson for violation of the settlement agreement.     Please call me so that we may discuss. Thanks.  Tim C.

"Hi, Janel,  I thought that I initialed those already.  If I didn't, I'll do it when I get back after my vacation next week.  In the meantime, go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at VP level sign for Corp.  If I didn't initial, you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer, because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature.

Affirmative Action Plan development is supported by specific software that was implemented in January 2000.   ? The Plans consist of two primary elements, the narrative portion and the statistical portion.  ? Narrative was reviewed for legal merit in January 2000 by George Chaffee, Attorney at Law, Littler Mendelson, Walnut Creek, CA and by a local consultant, George Pharis, President, Strategic Direction Resources Inc.  o Recommended changes were incorporated into the FY 2000 AAPs.  The narrative section of an AAP is generally the same each year with few changes necessary. ? The statistical portion requires an intense amount of labor each year.  The database of the plan has to be confirmed for accuracy ? Plans are reviewed against the previous year's AAP for continuity ? Once we have drafts of the AAP (narrative and statistical portion) for a business unit: o Draft plan and a memo are sent to the business unit HR head for review o HR head requests any changes and confirms their buy-in before the plan is finalized and distributed to their organization o Execution signatures are obtained o Plans are distributed to management level employees to guide their hiring/promotion and termination decisions throughout the course of the plan year. o Quarterly utilization reports are completed and sent to the business units to allow them to track their progress achieving AAP goals o If a ""new goal"" is warranted from quarterly reports, it is highlighted for the business unit to consider as they move forward through the rest of the year  Recommendations:  ? 02 Plan narratives drafted and reviewed by appropriate legal counsel.  (Complete no later than Y/E 2001)  o OFCCP changes to regulations became effective December 13, 2000.  New Regs have reduced some narrative                requirements however underlying responsibilities are still implied   ? AAP Plan drafts provided to HR Head and respective legal counsel for review, change, and approvals before being submitted for execution signatures ? OLER to revise and communicate new execution milepost to get AAPs completed. Earliest data access date is Jan 15 - (reflecting Y/E promotions, terms etc)    OLER is committed to supporting an effective AAP process for client units.

It occurred to me that we often are successful in resolving these things quickly and cheaply by having someone at Enron call a contact at the new company, TXU, and bring the issue to a head. So far as I know no one has made such a call in this case.  I recall from the Union litigation a few years ago there was an Enron exec who went to TUFCO by the name of Mark McNally. We deposed Mark in that case and he was very professional and cooperative. McNally had been at Enron and (I believe) Houston Pipeline for 15-17 years. He's now been with TXU 4 or 5 years and is CFO. A call to him might get this off dead center. I'm copying Mark on this email because I know Mark knows McNally well.  What do you think?

Please find attached the resume of Mitch Ludwin. Mitch has great academics (JD '89 cum laude-top 8%, Law Review, Order of the Coif, etc.) and extensive transactions experience with an emphasis on finance. Mitch is currently Senior Associate at Troutman Sanders in Atlanta. Mitch was originally from New York and began his career practicing for three years with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in that City. Mitch then joined Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander Y Ferdon, spending two years with the firm's New York office, followed by a year and a half with the firm's Los Angeles office. Upon dissolution of Mudge, Rose, Mitch joined Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson in Los Angeles.  Mitch then accepted an opportunity with Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, where he practiced four years. Mitch joined the firm to participate in the start up of the firm's project finance practice and to be closer to his wife's family. This area of the firm's practice did not develop as anticipated and the attorneys brought in with this expertise moved to other firms. Mitch joined Troutman to focus on asset-based lending. I would be happy to provide any additional information concerning Mitch which you may wish and to arrange an interview, if you so desire. I anticipate receiving a transactions list, which I will forward to you. I have also submitted Mitch's resume to Enron Energy Services for consideration.  Regards, Bruce Menke   - Ludwin, Mitchell F.

When an employee is being terminated HR is giving them an agreement instead of severance pay.  The question is can it be taxed by the W-4 or does it have to be taxed as supplemental pay.  My understanding is if an employee receives payments from an employer that are not part of their ordinary wages, it is considered supplemental wages and if the payment has been clearly indicated as other than ordinary wages it is taxed at the flat 28% (which will soon be 27.5%). I would appreciate your input as to whether we could set up an agreement element in the system and tax it at the W-4 rate and not have any tax issues down the road that Enron could be held accountable, and what regulation could we use for support.

L, T   -----Original Message----- From:  Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Cindy Olson- EVP HR & Community Relations@ENRON Sent: Sunday, July 08, 2001 5:31 PM To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON Subject: HR Organizational Changes   In the past few months, Enron has received numerous requests from other companies to share some of the processes and systems that we have developed within HR.  Also, several new businesses have been created recently by consulting companies to pursue what some financial analysts believe is a huge untapped market in aggregating HR services.  Recently, we completed an internal review to consider what role Enron could play in this arena and have decided to explore some very specific external opportunities.  Due to the time commitment required to pursue these opportunities, we are assigning dedicated resources to this effort.  Effective immediately, the HR community will have three major areas of focus that will be working together in order to optimize HR transformation and commercialization.  Taking the lead roles will be myself, Mary Joyce and David Oxley (see below and attached chart).  ? I will lead this new effort in addition to continuing to lead those areas of HR that are our prime candidates for commercial opportunities.  Reporting to me on this commercialization effort will be:  Brad Coleman with the overall lead; Andrea Yowman who will focus on software applications such as PEP, Expertfinder and Global Compensation; Sarah Davis who will focus on Worklife; Elyse Kalmans who will focus on Community Relations; Cynthia Barrow who will focus on Benefits and Wellness; and Yevgeny Frolov and Dan Brown who will focus on E-learning and Talent Management.  I will continue to report to Steve Kean.  ? David Oxley will take the overall lead for HR across all business units focusing on continuing to increase the value HR brings internally to Enron.  The networked recruiting, Organization Development and Training and Business Unit Compensation consulting functions, the Global PEP team, as well as the generalist consulting responsibilities for all Corp. groups, will report directly to David. The HR leads for EWS, EES, EBS, ETS and EGAS will report jointly to their business unit OTC's and to David from a functional HR perspective. In this regard David will now report to Steve Kean.  ? Mary Joyce will add Global Information Management, Corporate Compensation services and Reporting/ Analysis, to her current Executive Compensation responsibilities.  Kathy Schultea, Felecia Acevedo, Cindy Ward and Suzanne Brown will report into Mary's organization. Mary will continue to report to Steve Kean.  ? With Drew Lynch's promotion to COO Metals and David's increased responsibilities, Robert Jones will take the HR lead for EWS Americas. Robert will report to the EWS OTC. Jon Chapman has been appointed head of HR for EEL, based in London, and will report to the EEL OTC. Both Robert and Jon will report to David from a functional HR perspective.  Additional realignment of resources will enable our team to further improve daily employee services, partner with Business Unit initiatives and maximize opportunities for commercialization.  These modifications are as follows:    ? Scott Gilchrist will lead HR for the newly formed EGAS.  As such he will focus his attention on the asset positions in South America, Latin and Central America, the Middle East and Asia.  The European assets will continue to be a part of EEL.  Scott will also work closely with Rebecca McDonald and Sandip Mallick in relation to our assets in India.  Scott will report to the EGAS OTC, Rebecca McDonald and David as above.  ? Michelle Cash has agreed to take the lead of the Corporate OLER function for an interim period to determine how it should operate and be organized.  She will report to me for this particular function, but of course will remain primarily a part of the EWS legal function reporting to Mark Haedicke.    ? Sheila Walton will lead the HR Generalist activities for all Corp functions.  Jo Ann Hill, and all of the corporate generalist functions currently under Jo Ann, will report to Sheila Walton.  Sheila will continue to report to David.  ? Sarah Davis will add the Click at Home program to her current responsibilities, and will continue to report to me.

"I guess that I would look at this a bit differently.  We are not penalizing a person for the cost of obtaining a visa; rather, it is the fact that he did not come through on his accepted offer and start to work for us that is the issue.  Does that matter?   -----Original Message----- From:  Goode, Diane   Sent: Thursday, July 12, 2001 2:40 PM To: Cash, Michelle Cc: Daffin, Margaret Subject: Recovery of H-1B Visa Fees  Margaret Daffin and I had a conference call with Alice Gruber regarding recovery of our expenses related to obtaining H-1B visas for new employees.  Margaret estimates there have been three/possibly four instances where an individual has walked away from a position after we had committed time and money to process the visa application.  According to Alice, the DOL regulations changed last year.   The regulations do not allow an employer to penalize a foreign national for the employer's cost of obtaining the visa.  The regs do allow the employer to recover ""bonafide liquidated damages"" in the amounts ""stipulated by the parties at the beginning of the contract.""  The ""liquidated damages"" may vary from state to state.  Since our offer letter does not put these candidates on notice of our intent to recover such costs, there has been no stipulation by the parties.  If we put them on notice, then the most we could attempt to recover would be our attorneys fees, not the filing fees.    However, Alice does not recommend that we attempt to recover our costs.  She thinks the legal fees for trying to recover these monies would outweigh the H-1B costs ($3,000.00 on average).  Also, Alice expressed concern that if we add some type of ""notice"" language to the offer letter, that we will force some candidates to accept jobs with other companies that don't threaten to recover these costs.  She believes this could have a ""chilling"" effect and cause us to lose quality candidates.    I asked if we could put some kind of notice in the packet that Margaret Daffin sends out to the Candidates explaining what information she needs to process their visa applications.  We can do that, but that may drive some candidates away.  Alice thinks the unstable economy will reduce the number of candidates who walk away after the visa has been processed.  s. Apparently this was a fairly common practice in the last couple of years when the economy was stronger and the candidates were more cavalier about turning down positions.     Let me know what you think.  Alice would like to be very involved if we decide to try to collect these monies.

EBS Office of the Chairman Sent by: EBS Announcements 07/12/01 11:10 AM     To: EBS Worldwide  cc:   Subject: Changes at EBS     To:  All EBS Employees Worldwide  From:  EBS Office of the Chairman  Subject: Changes at EBS  Date:  July 12, 2001  Since its inception, EBS has seen dramatic changes in the communications industry.  The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two years ago has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains committed to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly respond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.  The Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be adjusting the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This means that we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our commercial efforts.  To achieve this, we will take the following steps:  EBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will involve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those units within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and costs of the support functions.  All EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:  Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele We will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.   North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.  Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.  All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to most effectively meet the future needs of EBS.  The Portland office will be closed by October 1.  Portland employees will be advised by their supervisors of their relocation or redeployment status by July 27.  These changes will affect many EBS employees through relocation, redeployment, severance or movement to another part of Enron.  We have not yet worked out all of the details of these changes, but your supervisor will apprise you of how this affects you as soon as possible, and no later than July 27.

"Michelle,  As I indicated in my voice mail this morning, I am working with Janice Priddy, Manager of Enron Corporate Payroll, on a significant employment tax refund project.  We are in the process of quantifying potential FICA, federal unemployment and state unemployment tax refunds related to both internal and external acquisitions involving employees.  Essentially, if we are able to determine that the predecessor company had beneficial unemployment tax rates, we may be in a position to either retroactively or prospectively take advantage of those rates.  In addition, mid-year transactions may also result in a refund of amounts paid by Enron in excess of certain federal and state wage bases (Enron may be entitled to take credit for those wages paid by the acquired company prior to, but during the same calendar year, as the transaction).  We obtained Enron Corporate Data Sheets from Kate Cole and Deborah Korkmas was designated as a legal contact related to several external acquisitions. We have prepared a short, one page questionnaire, which will assist us in determining whether a significant refund opportunity exists related to these particular acquisitions.  According to the Corporate Date Sheets, Deborah is the legal contact for the following acquisitions:  2000 - Garden State Paper Company, LLC (FEIN: 94-3371710) 2000 - KUCC Cleburne, LLC (FEIN: not listed) 2000 - Tenaska IV Partners, Ltd. (FEIN: not listed) 2000 - Harrier Power Corporation (FEIN: not listed)  Please complete the attached questionnaire for each acquisition with as much information as possible.  If the acquisition did not involve employees, just complete the top portion of the questionnaire and answer questions 1 and 2.  In reference to question 5, since it is unlikely that you have access to such detailed payroll information, if you could provide the states in which the predecessor had employment, we will then be in a position to contact state agencies to gather more detailed information.  Thank you for your assistance in this process.  If you have any questions, please call me at (713) 237-5346 or Janice at x37839.

If any of these employees are considered for re-hire, please ensure           that the following procedure is followed:           1.      Any former HPL rehired into Enron must come in via a resume submitted to an open posted position.  (i.e. No slam dunks)          2.      The candidate should be interviewed with other qualified candidates. (i.e. No single candidate on the job applicant summary).          3.      If the candidate is offered a position, it cannot be at a higher level and/or higher salary (i.e Inducement).  FYI, all HPL                  employees received an increase when they started at AEP.   The exception to this is if they are being rehired into a                   higher level position.           4.

The purpose of this e-mail is to tell you about a new program which we are rolling out that will benefit the ENTIRE ENRON HR COMMUNITY. It is called the HR Warehouse. It is a collection of folders located on the O Drive  which have been set up to increase communication between the various BUs' HR groups. The idea was born out of our experiences in the HR Forum, where various members of the Enron HR community would share ideas, goings on, etc. The primary goal is to increase efficiency.  Why re-create the wheel when it is already on the road elsewhere? We all have a variety of programs, processes, forms, etc. which we use in our daily work life. Through this repository, you can now share your ideas with others, and put their ideas to work for you. Also, there is a parking lot for HR related questions, where you will be able to get answers/ advice for whatever problems/ issues you are dealing with. The document below is the framework for this program. The only way this will be effective, however, is for people to use it! I am in the process of setting up security access for these folders, and need your assistance. Can you please e-mail me a list of EE's who you feel would benefit from the HR Warehouse (actually, everyone could, but we need to restrict access!). Also, if you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know.  Thank you!

Sent: Tuesday, July 31, 2001 8:54 AM To: Cash, Michelle Subject: Heads Up   Last night Sheila Walton asked if I would be interested in being the Generalist for Corporate HR (just an extra assignment along with my other responsibilities).  I told her I would be interested but would need to talk with you about it and of course she would need to discuss it with David.  The reason I'm interested is because it would allow me to keep up with what is happening in the Generalist world.  When I was the HR Rep for HR North America, I mostly dealt with Employee Relations type issues for the HR group.  Although those type problems with HR occur infrequently it requires someone who could handle information confidentially and with sensitivity.  Sheila feels that someone from our group would also lend a certain amount of neutrality since our group is somewhat separate from the other Corporate functions.  Also it is right in line with my primary responsibility now, dealing with Employee Relations issues.  Sheila said she would provide all the administrative support needed and there is staffing to deal with hiring.    I expect that the added duties would take less than 5% of my time.  Although I already have my hands full now with the OLER duties I think I could make it work even if it means extending my work day or doing more week-end work.  I recognize the big undertaking that we have going with the Employee Relations and would not compromise the quality of work that would be needed to be successful.  What do you think?

That relationship shall be determined based on common law=  as illustrated in case law and currently under U.S. Internal Revenue Servi= ce Revenue Ruling 87-41. Accordingly, for purposes of applying Opinion 25, = a grantee meets the definition of an employee if the grantor consistently r= epresents that individual to be an employee under common law. The definitio= n of an employee for payroll tax purposes under the U.S. Internal Revenue C= ode includes common law employees. Accordingly, a grantor that classifies a=  grantee potentially subject to U.S. payroll taxes as an employee under Opi= nion 25 must also (except as provided in paragraph 6) represent that indivi= dual as an employee for payroll tax purposes. A grantee does not meet the d= efinition of an employee under Opinion 25 solely because the grantor repres= ents that individual as an employee for some, but not all, purposes. For ex= ample, a requirement or decision to classify a grantee as an employee for U= .S. payroll tax purposes does not, by itself, indicate that the grantee is = an employee for purposes of Opinion 25 because the grantee must also be an = employee of the grantor under common law.

"VINSON & ELKINS LABOR & EMPLOYMENT E-LERT ___________________________________________________________  Court Holds Employer Owes At-Will Employee Duty of Care in Conducting Investigation  In Texas Farm Bureau Insurance Companies v. Sears, the Waco Court of Appeals held that an employer had a duty to its at-will employee to use reasonable care in conducting an investigation into his alleged misconduct.  This case adds additional cause for concern among Texas employers dealing with allegations of employee misconduct and, in conjunction with other recent cases regarding such investigations, indicates a further erosion of the at-will employment doctrine.  The dissenting judge recognized the significant impact that this holding will have on that doctrine, titling his dissent ""At-Will Employment is Dead.""

Since Enron's employees are assigned an SAP identification numbers (P number) and an HR number, could Enron as a company use these IDs instead of the SS numbers?  This will be safer for all employees.  For example, I am concerned when I buy the monthly bus passes and I have to fill in my SS number.  I do not feel secure at all to see my SS in so many databases at Enron, especially when some databases are from third-parties (out-sourcing).  We could use our badge number there instead of our SS.  Please let me know how your organization can help the Enron employees feel safer about the safeguard of their SS number.

This is a detailed list that includes information about the tables which Enron has purchased to support various non-profits. If an Enron employee has volunteered to fill a table, their name will appear in the far right column. Please share this information with the Executive with which you work, as we would like to utilize every table that we buy. When an Enron employee volunteers to fill a table, we encourage them to leverage it by inviting co-workers, customers, community leaders, etc.    If you volunteer to fill a table, it is important that you immediately let me know, and I will serve as the liaison with the non-profit organization.  Attached is the updated Community Relations Tables Report.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me directly.  Thanks,  Hilda Bourgeois-Galloway, CPS Enron - Community Relations hbourge@enron.com <mailto:hbourge@enron.com> 713/345-6805   ",misha.siegel@enron.com,michelle.cash@enron.com,RE: Community Relations Tables Report,2001-08-10 07:50:00-07:00,sent

Has Enron determined that it will no longer be involved with DealBench.com and given permission to allow Mr. Munk to independently raise funds for a proposed management buy-out or sale to an independent third party?  or Has Enron determined that it will not go forward with DealBench.com at this time, but it is possible in the future that it will still be involved with DealBench.com?  I note that Mr. Munk states that Enron is actively seeking a buyer for the platform.  What discussions have taken place with respect to a transaction for the purchase of DealBench.com.     Regardless of Mr. Munk's intentions, as stated in his letter of August 7, 2001, Enron must make a determination to allow Mr. Munk to use Enron's idea, etc. for DealBench.com as it is proprietary and belongs to Enron and not Mr. Munk.  If Enron has made the decision to sell DealBench.com and Mr. Munk, now no longer an Enron employee, is able to put together a group to purchase this Internet platform, I don't believe that this would constitute a violation of the Conflict of Interests Policy as described in Enron's Code of Ethics.   It appears that Mr. Munk is requesting permission from Enron to move forward with respect to DealBench.com as described in his letter.   Please confirm Enron's intentions with respect to DealBench.   In addition, please advise of any communications/discussions with Mr. Munk regarding DealBench.com and his ability to be a part of DealBench.com in the event he finds a buyer or becomes part of a group which purchases DealBench.com.

The only exception to this is individuals engaged in an electronic communication service or a remote computing service to the public are obligated under 42 U.S.C. 13032 to report child porn to the Cyber Tip Line at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  I looked at the definitions of ""electronic communication service"" and ""remote computing service"" and the second does not seem to apply although the former could apply.  The statute appears to qualify both as providing those services ""to the public"" so I would not think an email system for employees would apply.  The definition of electronic communication service is pretty broad though.  If you want me to investigate this further let, me know, but I would think we have a good argument that we do not provide these services to the public.  The child porn statute, 18 U.S.C. 2252A, covers pornography involving girls under the age of 18, so much porn could be child porn.  There are enhanced penalties for certain types of child porn and for child porn involving children under the age of 12.  There is an affirmative defense under the statute if the possessor of child porn destroys it or reports it to a law enforcement agency.  Therefore, it seems the best course of action is to destroy anything the company has and there does not appear to be a reporting obligation.  Ashley anonymously called the FBI and the DA and their responses are indicated below.  The information obtained from the FBI and DA's office is consistent with my recommendations.

Bluewater is a provider of prepaid calling cards. They purchase minutes from wholesale telcom carriers on a take or pay basis and then resell them to retail customers. Bluewater is responsible for marketing the minutes to the retail customers, and all volume and price risk for the minutes.          I developed for Bluewater a model that allows them to structure their prepaid calling cards to maximize profitability while minimizing volume risk. The model uses their historical calling profiles and allows them to compute the expected profitability of a given calling card platform. The model utilizes statistics as well optimization theory.          My current  working relationship with Bluewater is a licensing aggrement which allows them to use my model on an ongoing basis. They pay me a percentage of their monthly revenues for use of the model. As they collect more data from their switch I am occasionally asked to recalibrate the model (about once every 2 months).           That is the extent of my envolvment with Bluewater.

In    maintaining contact with the OSHA  Investigator on this case, I've had    several amiable conversations regarding  She's status and stance in the    matter.  As you know, by virtue of my  initial call to the Investigator    (Randall L. Ounce) NEPCO satisfied the first  requirement of the 15 day    response window.  I advised him during that call  that NEPCO was in the    discovery phase whereby documentation was being collected  to support    NEPCO's position.  He admitted to not yet having dialogue with  the    claimant and therefore took no exception to our needing more time.  He    in fact added one additional week to the two weeks I had requested.  He    felt it may take this long for him to review the allegations and contact    the  claimant.  In a subsequent conversation a week later, I advised him    of the  fact that information was still coming in about the case.    Again, he stated  he was unable to contact the claimant despite numerous    calls to the claimants  home.  On August 15, 2001 I completed NEPCO's    formal response to Mr.  Koonce's which was mailed the same day    certified-return receipt.  I called  Mr. Ounce to advise him that our    response had been mailed.  Once more he  said that he had been unable to    contact the claimant.  She's plan is to  send written notification to    the claimant with a set number of days in which the  claimant must    respond.  In the event claimant doesn't, OSHA will close the  case.  At    this time, Mr. Ounce does not have a strong feeling the  claimant will    respond.  Additionally, after discussion of the supporting  documents,    timelines and the lack of response by the claimant, Mr. Ounce  admitted    to believing this to be a classic case of employee  disgruntlement.  My    feeling is that the case will be closed by OSHA  with no further action.    So that you may enter it into your file, I will  mail you a hard copy of    NEPCO's formalized response.

"I have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the Ecoelectrica offices.  It looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials.  Mere possession of these materials is a violation of law.  Our outside counsel called the FBI, which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there, it does not have  a duty to report it.  We also received advice that the Puerto Rico office of the FBI might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved.  Our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local FBI office and talk with a duty agent.  The number is 787-754-6000.  Given the situation of the possible sale, however, we may choose not to take that route.  In any event, if we don't report it, all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible.

"Tara,  Thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume.  He certainly has a strong academic and work history.  Unfortunately, it is not Enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law school.  We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here.  The rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.  So, please thank your friend for his interest.  If you would like, I would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school.  Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.  Call me with any questions.

You commented and stated that if anyone had any questions=  or  concerns regarding this matter to shoot a e-mail to you, and you would=   respond .  After that statement regarding redeployment, I felt  compelled=  to do just what you said-- send a message about my redeployment  experienc= e.  I am doing this for two reasons: 1) to  prevent what has happened to me=  (from the HR representatives side of  redeployment) from happening to any = other Enron employee whether redeployment or  any other experience with Enr= on's HR reps and,  2) to let  you know the redeployment process at Enron is=  effective and efficient  and two of  the MAIN values of Enron must be exal= ted higher.   Those values are Communication and  Respect. =20 =20     I received redeployment from  Enron Broadband Services- Investment grou= p on Monday, June 18th, 2001.   Sheila Walton, a HR rep spoke to me regardi= ng what the process would  entail.  During this meeting, Sheila mentioned t= he redeployment process to  me, but discussed and stressed to me more, my o= ptions  when I departed the company, rather than my options to locate anoth= er  position with the company, not at all promoting the advantage of  redep= loyment and its many success stories.  With no directions from Sheila  Walt= on, I took it upon myself to contact Joyce Barrett in the redeployment grou= p  for advice and guidance.  I met Joyce through a info-luncheon hosted for=   EBS assistants and the DoubleTree to give information about redeployment = and how  the process works and it's successes.  Because of a lack of  Commu= nication, to the redeployment department, after a  week I did not have any = information about me going into redeployment,  so at the end of the week, I=  had no location for a redeployment desk and I  was leaving my department a= t the end of the week of June 18-22.  =20 =20     Due to this lack of  communication, I had to take off Monday & Tuesday = June 25th, 26th, to have  my desk churned and locate a space for me for 45 = days.  Joyce Barrett  contacted me with a location and more information reg= arding my redeployment  process.  Located in 3 Allen Center, I set-up my se= arch for  a ""new"" job at Enron, and my goal was to do my best to find a job=   within Enron because that was a opportunity that I felt I owed myself and=   Enron as a whole, by becoming Enron proud and believing in the visions  a= nd values.  I met with Marie Jensen of Spearion to review my resume  and sh= arpen my interview tactics.  Joyce  Barrett, Michele Hargrave and Brinella = Knight were in contact with me to find  out how my job search was going and=  lending support in any way.   I  had many interviews with companies outsid= e and within Enron.  An  experience to meet new and interesting people and = a opportunity that I feel  I would have not been able to have without redep= loyment, so I  have no regrets about being redeployment.   I must tell you =  that I was afraid, because a lot about this process, I was unsure of and m= y  HR rep did nothing to assure me or inform me that this transition  is on= e that can be rewarding, as well as a strong  challenge. =20     With Enron's values  system, Respect, Integrity, Communication and Exce= llence in place and  strongly promoted by you  and Jeff Skilling (before hi= s  departure), I want to stress to you that my experience with the HR side = of  redeployment, has NOT carried out the value system that Enron promotes =  and I'm sure whoever sent the comment about redeployment in that meeting  = had every meaning of HR person representing Enron in such a  way that ""a jo= ke"" is a kind way of putting it. No one should be  treated this way.   On J= uly 31, 2001, I took a   temporary position in the Associate & Analyst Prog= ram headed by Billy  Lemmons and Traci Warner working with Jeff Davis, John=  Walt and Cathy Lira as  well as supporting the group as a whole.  I worked=  in this department  until  August 21, 2001.  I received a message from Shi= rley Cox,  Sheila Walton's assistant inquiring whether or not I had a  posi= tion within Enron.  I called Shirley back and gave  her information about t= he temporary assignment I had taken in the Associate  & Analysts Program. O= n  August 14th, a call was made by Sheila  Walton to a Sr. Admin in the Ass= ociate & Analyst Program,  inquiring whether I was working this department.=   The admin passed the  information to Jeff Davis and he contacted Sheila W= alton as to where I was  working and how long I had been working in the dep= artment.  With a  remorseful sounding voice, Sheila proceeded to inquiry to=  Jeff more details, to  which Jeff provided her.  I had overtime hours that=  I tried to put into the  system, but I was unable to get into the time sys= tem.  After the  conversation with Jeff Davis and Sheila Walton, I  find  o= ut Sheila  had started the process to delete me from the system,  before my=  original end date of August  15th.   I accepted a permanent position with = Enron Networks as a Admin  Assistant II on August 14, 2001 reporting to Sam=  Leuschen.  I started  that position on August 22, 2001. On August 24, 2001= , after 2 days  of employment was terminated from the position and Enron du= e to  Business Reorganization in Enron Networks. =20 =20     I am very concerned about the  way this matter was handled and the seri= es of events that surrounded this  action.  As a result,  I would like to d= iscuss with you and or  someone in the responsible capacity and go into fur= ther detail.   I have received a form letter stating that Enron can termina= te my employment at  will, at any time and for any reason.  I feel this act= ion has been provoked  for other reasons.=20 =20      In ending this message to  you, Mr. Lay, you must know that redeployme= nt at Enron is  a effective tool that should remain in place.  You should a= lso know and  commend those persons who work in and closely with the redepl= oyment group.   Enough good things cannot not be said about those people wh= o go  out of their way to get you the help, the encouragement, the tools yo= u need  while facing this process.  I realize that a business  decision was=  made, and EBS downfall was a business decision, but this matter is  not a = business one.  When redeployment takes place, the human side of you  feel s= omewhat lost, hurt and you take it personally,although I realize it  was a = business decision.  This occurrence was targeted and directed at  me person= ally by Sheila Walton. Human resources should work with the human  being to=  make you a better person through visions and values, not to be treated  in= humanely.  Whether they are Enron's values or values in  general, HR repres= entatives should portray what human  beings should have most of all...VALUE= S, and  when there is no communication, no respect, no integrity, ""the  jok= e"" begins and excellence is lost.. =20     I look forward to hearing from  you or someone in your office soon.

I hope all is well with you.   Below is a question from Mark Greenberg, an attorney here in EWS, about Arthur Andersen and whether we have some sort of Enron-wide agreement with them.  I would think that it would be in our best interests to have some sort of global agreement, particularly one with volume discounts in the event that all of Enron uses a certain level of service.   Is something like that in the works?  If not, do you believe that it would be useful?  If so, I would be happy to assist in drafting such an agreement.

Lately I have been asked to review letter agreements between EWS and Arthur Anderson LLP for services to be provided by AA.  These services generally relate to having AA personnel work on EWS projects on Enron property (in our offices).  I have asked GSS if we have any global agreement that would cover this, but have been advised that the only AA agreement we have is an old one that has probably been rolled in to the Accenture LLP group - which is an offshoot AA and, as I understand it, not affiliated with AA any longer.  The concern with the letter agreements is that they favor AA in most all salient terms, contain non-solicit provisions and are sometimes not provided to Enron before the work has been initiated or, at times, completed.  It would seem to me that either a Corp. or EWS master agreement should be put in place to handle these.   Let me know your thoughts and how you want to proceed.   Thanks.

"Yesterday, Steve heard back from Harold Busch at OFCCP inWashington.  Steve's description of their conversation was more encouraging than any of the discussions we have had with the Regional Office.  Steve gave me a general description of the conversation, which is summarized below.     Mr. Busch indicated that he wanted to discuss this matter as a ""last step before litigation.""  He said that although it was an old case, it was not a closed case from the agency's perspective because there still might be victims out there.  He also suggested that the open audit probably was a ""sore thumb"" for Enron.  Therefore, he was interested in talking about possible resolution.   Steve indicated that he appreciated that, but wondered what Busch had heard about the audit.  Busch had heard only from the OFCCP side, and had no perspective on Enron's side (although he had reviewed our response to the show cause notice).  In response, Steve did a little water dropping.  He told Mr. Busch that the Regional Office never identified a specific victim of discrimination or unfair treatment, but provided only a statistical approach.  He said that Enron did its own, individualized analysis.  Enron looked at specific individuals to find out why there were pay distinctions in those groups where there may have been a statistical concern.  In most instances, we found legitimate explanations for the disparities; in those where we could not, we took care of the situation.     Steve also clarified that there was a fundamental difference of opinion between Enron and the agency over which statistical analysis to use. The agency's approach was broad, which resulted in a demand for a big payment, as opposed to our individualized review.  Mr. Busch responded that this was why he thought it would be productive for us to get together.   Busch indicated that he was interested in closure of the matter, if possible.  Either it is closed through a conciliated resolution, litigation, or, if the agency is wrong, it could close the case itself.     At the end of the conversation, Steve indicated a willingness on our part to talk with him and his team.  Busch offered to come to Houston to meet, or to have Enron go to DC for the first meeting, with the second meeting taking place in Houston.  Steve thought that Busch may want to come to Houston.  In terms of timing, we are looking at the week of Sept. 24 as the earliest possible date for such a meeting.     All in all, it sounds like an encouraging conversation.  I believe that the first meeting should be in DC to reduce the likelihood of facing players from the local office, as I believe that they will pursue their prior view of the matter.  We are going to regroup next week to begin work on a high-level presentation to discuss with Busch when the meeting actually takes place.

Let me simply make a  list.  I apologize if this is not  Pulitzer Prize mat= erial.  Timeliness  is the most important factor at the moment. =20 Speak to the  organization.  Pull management  together first to discuss the= ir responsibilities as managers and give them  guidance.

We must each individually and =  organizationally replace that with something different. =20 Acknowledge that  individuals will respond and recover at different paces. =  Some will want to get back to work as  quickly as possible to regain their=  sense of normalcy and control.  Others will have difficulty focusing  for = a long time.  Most likely it  will be sporadic and not a constant inability=  to focus.  This is a very normal response to a  crisis. =20 Depending on your  organization and the level of direct impact, you may cho= ose to bring a  professional counselor or team of counselors on site for a = day or longer.  They can conduct group processes and  individual counseling= . =20 Another possibility is  a chat room where employees can share their experie= nces, feelings, and have a  place to vent.  The question will  arise, how l= ong should the chat room be operational.  For right now, don't set a time l= imit,  but review it in a couple of weeks or a month.

We changed our agenda to spend the last  half h= our of the day planning about how we would lead our organizations through  = this tragedy.  We discussed the role  of Human Resources and the Legal depa= rtments.  We wondered at the inconsistency of the  beautiful day, the sunsh= ine and the green grass in the suburbs of Minneapolis  and the horror we we= re hearing on the news.  We encouraged people who had two hours  of drive t= ime to leave a half hour early to be home with their families.  We all took=  calls and made calls during  the day to check on family and friends.

The sense he got from the call was that almost every company was planning to pay employees the difference between their normal wages and military base pay, exclusive of allowances, for a certain period which varied among the companies. Many were going to pay for 90 days; some, for 180 days, and a few for a year. One of the companies that was opting for 180 days had previously provided a pay differential for 4 weeks.    *  Another attorney was advised by a major energy industry client that it was paying the difference between the military pay and the employee's salary for one year.    *  One attorney has spoken to several firm clients over the past few days about this, and almost all of them are going to exceed the legal requirements by offering some form of continued compensation, but no specifics as to duration.    *  Another Littler lawyer was told by a large industrial client that it would pay the difference between military pay and normal salary, and continue benefit coverage, with no indication about maximum duration.

"The contents of this email are privileged and confidential.  Below is a quick summary of the general guidance provided by Mark Stubley during the conference call today.  If you have questions, please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-6401.  IBEW, Pipefitters, and others have tried to ""salt"" jobs down there in Florida.  The business agents will try to get out early and visit with the site manager to get a pre-hire agreement, if possible.  The business managers will take notes/keep diaries of their conversations with site managers and supervisors, so be aware of that possibility when you are approached by unions.  We should keep our own notes of conversations as they occur.  Should we designate one person to handle union relations?  We should have a very small group of people to have such a discussions, perhaps the HR site lead or the construction site manager would be the appropriate liaisons.  That way, we don't have the unions approaching our employees.  We have no obligation to have such conversations, but it is a good idea not to be antagonistic with them.   Better to be polite, let them know that we are mobilizing the project, but that we bid this work as a merit shop project and will not sign a pre-hire agreement.  We should not give them any information about our hiring process or plans.  We should tell them that we will be glad to consider their people at the time we are hiring, but that we are not taking applications at this time.  We should inform them about how to apply for positions at the site, which will be at an off-site Human Resources office.  We also are going to use the state employment offices for clerical personnel, but not for other types because we have not had much success in receiving qualified candidates.  There is a need for HR to look at the off-site office before the lease is signed.  Other issues surround gating at the facility.  How will it be gated?  Who will control entry and exits?  What about the other ways into the site?  How do we prevent persons from using an alternative entrance and then getting into our site to talk with our people?  Parking area will be on the other side of the plant.  There are roads between the parking gate and the building site.  Because of all these issues, we should look at a plat for the site and then look at the gating situation.  Back to Mark's suggestions:  Be careful of calls coming into the project.  Make sure that the receptionist or office manager knows what to say to callers.  Those calls should be directed to that site HR lead.  Also, should inform those people how to answer questions about hiring plans.  E.g., ""Are you hiring electricians out there?""  Those should be referred to HR's off site office.  Also, those people should know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees.  They should refer such questions to HR and not answer them.  We will have a script for the receptionist for such inquiries.  Be sure to follow the 30-day rule.  Also, follow our hiring practices consistently.  Ultimately, there will be training for others at the site after more employees are on site, perhaps the last week of October, on union avoidance and other issues.  One more follow up item is to make sure that our subcontracts have union harmony provisions.  Galen (Millie?) is going to send those to David Lund.  David Lund, Michelle Cash, and Mark Stubley will discuss the issue of which local counsel to get lined up in the event that we need someone locally.

All:   As some of you know, and many may not, we are still working on Project Fireball. Over the past month we have been negotiating with the Vulcan investors to create a structure that benefits both Vulcan and Enron.  We have gone from a structure where Enron would own 100% of the company to one that includes some equity, debt, and marketing. We feel fairly confident that we are close to agreeing on a deal that will involve the following basic components:  Enron will pay Vulcan $ 100 million cash for the following:          $  40 million will be to purchase somewhere around 18% to 19% of the equity in Triton Coal Company          $  60 million will be to refinance subordinated debt that Vulcan currently has with UBS (Enron will then provide financing of this $60 MM)          Enron will become the exclusive marketer for Triton coal and will receive a fee on each ton of coal sold (based on % of sales price)  We have indicated to Vulcan that we can close this deal within 30 days of their notification of acceptance of our bid. Some final due diligence issues need to be addressed by Enron before closing. The attached file includes a list of due diligence items that we have requested that are still outstanding.  Many of these may not apply, now that we will not purchase the entire company. Once Vulcan has accepted our bid we will need to move quickly and will need to let Triton know what outstanding issues we have to resolve. Please review this list and let me know by Monday afternoon of any items that we do not require in light of the new structure of the deal.  We will set meetings with many of you for Monday and Tuesday of next week to ensure a smooth closing process if we are selected.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

After sitting down with both, I made my recommendations and I got their feedback as well.  It seems that the following outlined recommendations is what we both agreed upon and would like to implement immediately.  However, I would like your blessing on this before I actually send out the communication to my team and the EWS HR Community.    I have attached our current termination process flow.    Recommendations from yesterday's mtg.   1) Begin requesting an American Express balance at the same time we send the request for the stock option summary.  2) Provide balance sheet in termination folder for generalist to conduct the Exit interview.  3) Reiterate to employee their signed corporate card agreement, Number 9, which you can see in the attachment below.   I understand that UPON MY TERMINATION I will have to pay any outstanding balance owed on the Corporate Card  PRIOR to receiving my final check.  I hereby authorize Enron to withhold from my check or checks, any and all amounts  outstanding.  4) Since the employe will be processing a final expense report and will be receiving a check from the expense report group, an automatic deduction from their final check for their balance should not be a great impact for them.  5) This will reduce the time and energy that HR Reps spend tracking ex-employees after the fact and confirming that they have paid Amex, after they have received their final Expense Report.  6) My team has the access to include Amex balance withholding as part of our SAP Termination action before payroll finalizes.  7) MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!  This reduces the liability that Enron has had to incur with Amex and will save our Company a tremendous amount of money.     8) For those balances that are more than the actual final check amount, the HR Svc Connection will work with the generalist on a case by case basis.  Again, if you could please give me your approval or feedback asap, that would be great.  Thank you ma'am.

Thanks.   -----Original Message----- From:  Cash, Michelle   Sent: Wednesday, September 26, 2001 2:02 PM To: Alvarez, Irma Subject: RE: AMEX card Agreement  I don't think you need to have a separate payroll deduction document at termination, but it probably would be good to provide them with a copy of the one they previously signed.  My thought was that it may make sense to remind all Amex card holders of the policy so that there are no surprises at termination.

I can work with Cheryl Slone, Johnny Ross & Ryan regarding the communication to all current Amex users. As for the communication to the HR Community, I can get that out today to make this new implementation to our Termination process effective 10/01/01.    Now, my only additional question now is, the employee has already signed the Amex Agreement as I specified below, do you see a need for me to include an additional document in the Termination packet for the employee to acknowledge as well for that Payroll deduction. I was planning on it since they have already signed the Amex agreement, but, if you think we (The HR Svc Connection) should, please let me know and I will prepare something and run it by you.

I think, quite frankly, that relying on the advice of such an outfit would provide more legal protection than talking to all of the lawyers in the world, although our advice could be an additional benefit.  As you know, we have an extensive task force report on workplace violence that would be relevant to this inquiry and could provide the basis for an analysis of this issue, although other areas would have to be explored.

"Michelle,  Kristin Walsh, a manager in Competitive Analysis, is returning from maternity leave on October 15th.  During Kristin's absence, the following changes have occurred in the group, and I just wanted to run them by you before we communicate them to her: 1)  Kristin will only have two direct reports instead of three. 2) Previously, Kristin's team as a whole was responsible for providing ENA (i.e. John and Louise, as well as traders) with competitive intelligence.  Instead of Kristen just overseeing the ENA process as a whole, Kristin and her two team members will have more specific duties, although Kristin will still be the primary point of contact for ENA.  Specifically, Kristin will gather and provide intelligence info for the Gas Team, and Kelly Holman will gather and provide info for East Power, and  Greg Whitman will do the same for West Power.  Robert Johnston, Kristin's supervisor,  and Scott Tholan, BUL, just felt like the level of service that Kristin's team was providing was not adequate because efforts were duplicated and Kristin could not provide enough ""face time"" with the head traders to gather and relay info, as well as directing her team.    Also,after Kristin's departure, it was learned that Kristen signed a contract for which she had no authority. Although Scott does not think that this has happened before, this particular contract blew up in their face.  Upon Kristin's return, Scottt, Robert, and I would like to communicate these changes to her (not in writing, just verbally), and just reitterate the fact that only Scott has the authority to sign contracts.  Additionally, we would like to tell Kristin that she needs to take a management training class so that she can learn to delegate and oversee responsibilities of the group, rather than micromanaging them.  Please let me know if this is going to create any additional problems, or if I need to take a different approach.    As always, thanks for your help.

Christy   Christy, we'd certainly appreciate it if you suggested Hewitt. We have a rather large center in the Woodlands, which is just outside Houston. Also, we have a number of consultants who work on the issues mentioned.  You could suggest Don Henderson as an initial contact. Don is a benefits lawyer in the Houston (i.e.., Woodlands) office who could help them locate the best Hewitt resource for the client. Don's number is 281-363-0456  I'm copying Don in case he has a suggestion of someone else who the client might contact.  It was good seeing you at the reception. Thanks for thinking of us!

She had a 3-month evergreen and was supposed to be paid her salary through that 90-day period.  Due to a computer glitch, Holly got terminated from payroll and did not receive a regular paycheck from August 8 through September 26.  As soon as Holly made Amy aware of the situation (Sept. 26), Irma got the computer records corrected and requested a check to pay monies due. The employee was sent a check via Federal Express.  Amy is concerned that we may have somehow ""breached"" the settlement agreement which would allow Holly to ignore her obligations re non-compete.  Is the non-compete still in effect as long as she got the money, even if it wasn't paid on time?   We know Holly is going to AEP at the end of the 90-day evergreen and Amy has already had to remind her of her non-compete obligations because Holly was seen lunching with an AEP executive.

I memorialized the key points in a summary email. Let me know if you or anyone else would like a copy of it.  On the issue of Ogletree training, I had mentioned that it might be more cost efficient to have someone in Florida conduct the training.  Mike had indicated a preference to use Mark Stubley at Ogletree.  Of course, since Mark has done it for us in the past, I am ok with him doing it as well.  I just was looking at the outside expenditures, as we all have been doing lately (particularly outside counsel bills), and thought that there may be some cost savings.  In some circumstances, outside counsel who have to travel cut their rates a bit for travel time (don't know if Stubley does that), so the cost differential could be minimal, but I thought I'd raise it since there are qualified attorneys in Florida who could assist in that arena.  I'll give Mark a call to finalize the issue of local counsel, which I do not believe to be significant.  Because Mark has contacted them, they already have run a conflict check and are ready to go.  All it would take to get them ""engaged"" would be a phone call.  There should not be any cost incurred at this point, because they only are on standby, so I think it is good to line them up.  I'll let you know if Jim Derrick has any issue with their recommendation.  I also have received recommendations for top-notch local labor counsel in Florida if we choose to go that route.

I would suggest that  you call Michelle (713-853-6401) anytime you have a concern with regard to  the progress of any labor and employment matter handled by outside or inside  counsel.  And if Stubley is concerned about who he would like to work with  in Florida, he is equally able to call Michelle and discuss it.  As for a review of the training on union avoidance by Ogletree Deakins, by  copy to Michelle, I'll ask for her input here.

I memorialized the key points in a summary email. Let me know if you or anyone else would like a copy of it.  On the issue of Ogletree training, I had mentioned that it might be more cost efficient to have someone in Florida conduct the training.  Mike had indicated a preference to use Mark Stubley at Ogletree.  Of course, since Mark has done it for us in the past, I am ok with him doing it as well.  I just was looking at the outside expenditures, as we all have been doing lately (particularly outside counsel bills), and thought that there may be some cost savings.  In some circumstances, outside counsel who have to travel cut their rates a bit for travel time (don't know if Stubley does that), so the cost differential could be minimal, but I thought I'd raise it since there are qualified attorneys in Florida who could assist in that arena.  I'll give Mark a call to finalize the issue of local counsel, which I do not believe to be significant.  Because Mark has contacted them, they already have run a conflict check and are ready to go.  All it would take to get them ""engaged"" would be a phone call.  There should not be any cost incurred at this point, because they only are on standby, so I think it is good to line them up.  I'll let you know if Jim Derrick has any issue with their recommendation.  I also have received recommendations for top-notch local labor counsel in Florida if we choose to go that route.

I would suggest that  you call Michelle (713-853-6401) anytime you have a concern with regard to  the progress of any labor and employment matter handled by outside or inside  counsel.

"Michelle -  We are struggling with the appropriate company identifier for business cards.  We are employees of Enron America, however some of our business cards show Enron North America (carryover from days of old), EWS (no longer/or will no longer exist), and some show Enron Corp (International Admin group).  Marge Nadasky in Corp Public Relations who deals with the Company logo and Company names on business cards, etc., has indicated that Legal prefers we use the operating company we are part of rather than Enron Corp (piercing the corporate umbrella issue).  She did say we could use just plain Enron if we are not part of the corporate group.    As part of a network services function which crosses all Enron business units, do you see any problems if we use Enron on business cards?

EMERGENCY CHECK IN POLICY FOR EBS FIELD OPERATIONS EMPLOYEES   In light of the recent tragedies that occurred in New York City and Washington, D.C., Enron Broadband Services Field Operations is adopting a new policy that requires field operations personnel to check-in during unusual situations and emergencies, whether natural or man-made.  Through this check in, management will be able to ensure that any and all necessary measures are taken to provide for the safety of employees.   Therefore, in the event of a disaster or emergency, all EBS employees and contractors shall call the Network Operations Center in Houston at 800 267-7028, as soon as they can do so safely, to advise EBS management of their status.  Since some personnel may be traveling or on a temporary assignment known only to their immediate supervision, all personnel are requested to check-in, not only those physically assigned to a location near the event.  Personnel on vacation or other leave should also make an effort to check-in so their safety can be assured as well. Phone contact is preferable, however, email or other communication services are acceptable. When you make the call, please provide the following information:  Name Phone number where you can be reached Immediate Supervisor Current location Assigned location Any assistance required  It is the goal and focus of the company to provide a safe and secure work atmosphere for all employees.

For some background, I've attached a memo that Enron Metals North America sent out to our staff on Friday.  We sent it out under the cover of our lead commercial and lead commercial support execs.  It is an acknowledgement and response to a memo sent out by the CEO and COO of EEL announcing their voluntary redundancy program.     Further to the memo, my colleagues in London HR have forwarded additional details on how the program will work in London.  These next four attachments contain general information about the program that can also be found on the EEL intranet site.  General information Application for VR VR Q&A UK VR Calculation    EEL plans on running the VR Program for 2 weeks starting today.  Following this 2 week program, they will then start a compulsory redundancy program with payout under the statutory requirements.  In preparation for this, each business unit will need to follow a selection process within each group to identify key employees. Here in North America, we are going through the same selection process.  Attached is the selection guide and an example spreadsheets we are using.          As much as we can, we want to offer a voluntary program in the US as well.  Doing so will help us send a unified global message within EEL; US employees will not be treated any different then their London colleagues.  However, as I noted in our telecon, our current involuntary severance is quite generous already and I can't imagine padding it even more.  I ran a quick calculation and based on the yrs of service employees carried over form MG, over 75% of our North America staff would eligible for over 4 months of severance.  There is a long history of tenure in Metals and the average time of service is 7 yrs.  Seems the selection process and criteria would also work for us in the US, as long as we apply it consistently, but I would welcome your thoughts.  Once you've had a chance to review it, please call me and we can discuss it further.

"Michelle,  Can you and the comp team help us identify who has contractual bonus targets for performing at the top 25%, 33% or 50% of the PRC ""criteria"" or ""performance scale"".  Obviously we have a number of contracts we entered into between Jun 99 and the beginning of the end of last year which have some sort of wording along the above lines in them. There are some critical questions I would like to get clarity on:  If BU's and support functions simply stop at 10/80/10 in their PRC's how will we deal with these contracts? Presuming all commercial staff are also relative ranked for bonus purposes separately to the PRC, can we use this scale instead (where it will be easier to identify a to half or quartile performance). Do we need to ensure that BU's and Functions that have people with such wording do split their middle 80%. If so how should we do this? Do we need to amend those contracts to wording that is easier to interpret? What proof or disclosure will we need to those individuals with this wording?

"Michelle,  All efforts to try to get Mo to reduce his contract pay and end the separation negotiations have been unsuccessful and on August 9th, he sent me an e-mail stating that he has decided to continue his garden leave with full pay & benefits and will await ""Enron's notification regarding termination according to his employment terms.""  We were prepared that he would come back with this and we will continue to pay him, but it's this last statement about the notification of termination that concerns me.

His contract states that if the Company terminates your employment without 12 months written notice, then the Company shall pay you the remainder of your salary for the 12 months from the date it gave your notice, in a lump sum.    His contract end date is 6/30/2002 and the last thing we want to do is to pay him additional money.  Please let me know what your legal interpretation of this notification clause is and whether or not we are required to give him a formal termination notice.

I immediately notified Bob Black and Mike Indivero by phone. I arrived on site about 9:40 and went to Tommy Cutrer's(Electrical Supt.) office and met with Joe, Tommy, Paul Wedell, Union Organizer for Local #630 of U. A. of  Plumbers and Pipefitters of the United States and Canada(based in West Palm Beach) and Otis (didn't get his last name) who we believe to be the Business Agent. Joe introduced me as the Site HR Manager and Otis offered us 1100 pipefitters and welders to do the mechanical work on this project. I told them that we were not in a position to take applications for pipefitters and welders because it was early  in the project and we have only 2 opening for carpenter helpers posted with the work force development commission. I told them at some time we would be hiring pipefitters and welders and they could apply for those positions at that time. I told them that we do not discriminate against anyone because of age, sex, race, religion or union affiliation. Otis the business agent asked if we were bringing all our people from outside the area. I  told them that Nepco has an Office in Lakeland, FL. where we are finishing up a power project and we would be offering employment to former employees who wanted to work in this part of the state. I told them that any of our unfilled needs would be filled by qualified craft personnel and that we would be happy to consider their applications. I exchanged business cards with Paul Wadell and told him to call me later in the month and let him know where our offsite employment was located. They left the jobsite.  Joe said that the conversations that occured prior to my arrival were not about our hiring policies. Joe deferred the hiring issues to me which is what Mark Stubley's recommendation were during our last conference call. Joe did an excellent job in keeping the hiring issues to a single point of contact. After they left Joe and I discussed several issues which we are moving on as quickly as possible. They are as follows.  1. Get ready for an OSHA or other Official visit in case the Union Organizer wants to be disruptive. Already prepped the site at 7:00 am Tuesday for visitors.  2. Made sure safety supervisor was on site and available to escort any visitors.  3. Contacted security company about implementing 24 hour patrols and single access gate.  4. Contacted fencing company to review fencing plan.  5. Instructed safety supervisor to place red barricade tape around jobsite perimeter with gates and signs to direct all employees and visitors to authorized access areas.  6. May want to consider ID badging system for Employees, Home Office Visitors, Vendors, Escorted and Unescorted badges. Keep Visitors/ Staff employee log for times when anyone enters or leaves the jobsite.  7. Have 1 project pager assigned to a different staff person each week to be the point of contact in case anything happens on site after hours that needs to be addressed.  8. I will get in touch with Carroll Scott with Fluor Daniel and Leonard Wallace with Foster Wheeler to see if they have any background on Pipefitters Local #630 and how serious an organizing campaign they might be willing to mount against Nepco.  9. Establish a project contingency plan on what to do if we have pickets at the gate.  10. Find out who we have as local counsel and notify them of this contact and what they might know about previous ULP's and organizing efforts by Local #630.  11. Contact Mark Stubley with Ogletree Deakins and advise him of this visit. Consider accelerating the Labor Relations Training date that was planned for Nov. with Bob King of Ogletree Deakins.  12. Have Tommy Cutrer, Joe Osler and Greg Renz write statements about what they said during their visit.  13. Post the property we control with signs that prohibit use of photographic, video or audio recording equipment on the property unless authorized by Mr. Osler.  14. Establish a Jobsite file maintained by the HR Site Manager of all union related activities and contacts to be used in our defense of any ULP charges.  If I think of anything else I'll let you know.",michelle.cash@enron.com,david.lund@nepco.com,FW: Jobsite Visit by Union Organizer - Lake Worth Repowering Proj  ect,2001-10-10 19:55:45-07:00,received

He has just a couple more questions.  1. Article 7.9 was adjusted to add the first sentence, which references articles of the employment agreement.  He wants to know the intent of this addition.  Also, article 4.4 is referenced and there is no 4.4 in the employment agreement.  2. Article 7.10 - He is still concerned about the situation where Enron is acquired by a company where he was employed.  I explained to him that such a situation would not fall under ""rehire"" by Enron.  However, he would like the last sentence to read, ""This provision would not apply if Employee is employed by an entity that may be acquired by or acquires a Company after the effective date of this agreement.""  These are all the items for you.  I'm still haggling with him over home leave and timing on shipment of goods.

Carol. I spoke with lara robinson this morning.

She also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released. Even if the person never returns due to a conversion to LTD she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees. Seems unusual to me.

"FYI -----Original Message----- From: Brownfeld, Gail  Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 10:01 AM To: Sanders, Richard B. Subject: FW: York Paper v. Enron/Holzer   FYI  -----Original Message-----  From: Clothier, Robert  Sent: Thu 10/11/2001 10:51 AM  To: Brownfeld, Gail  Cc: Klein, Samuel; Dubas, Jennifer  Subject: York Paper v. Enron/Holzer    Privileged and Confidential  Gail,  I had a productive conversation with Keith Dutill, the Stradley lawyer who I've known for decades and who is now representing York Paper.  The short of it is that he said he is very interested in trying to resolve this before the litigation machinery cranks up.  He will discuss it with his client and get back to me.  He said that York has ""strong feelings"" and then agreed with me that Enron feels the same way.  He felt that York has a ""good business sense"" and would be interested in reaching a compromise without spending a lot of dollars in legal fees.  Dutill does not know why two separate summons were filed in Delaware County. It's his understanding that the claims against Enron are largely the same as the claims against Holzer (with perhaps one or two exceptions that still relate to Holzer's employment with Enron).  He is working on a complaint that will cover both summons, and expects to file it in the next several weeks, certainly before the mediation conference on November 19th.  I said that we should try to start our own discussions before that mediation conference so that the mediator could focus on any areas of disagreement.  Here's how Dutill described York's claims:  Holzer worked for York Paper. When Holzer left York, York wanted to prevent Holzer from working for Enron. Holzer wanted to work for Enron, and so did Enron, so there was some ""agreement"" between Holzer/Enron and York.  In that ""agreement"", Holzer and Enron made ""promises"" about the way they ""would do business"" with York.  It appears that the promise was that Holzer and Enron would not bypass York Paper and deal directly with York Paper's customers.  Yet, according to Dutill, that is what Holzer and Enron did -- cut out York Paper as the middle man.  This has resulted in a ""fair erosion of business"" for York Paper.  It is ""not just a matter of subsequent solicitation.""  It also involves ""interference with existing contracts"" between York and its customers.   So, it would seem that York's claims might include breach of contract, interference with contractual relations and, perhaps, misrepresentation/fraud.  Interestingly, he did not mention any of the West Coast and Garden State Paper contracts we have been looking into.  If you have any thoughts, please let me know.  I will keep you informed of any further developments.

For this communication, I would like to focus on compensatory time off.  While Enron does not have a formal written policy on compensatory time off, we must not forget the regulatory obligations for administering this provision of the FLSA.   I encourage each of you to share this information with your client groups.  I recently overheard a conversation in the elevator where an employee was talking about all the comp time they had accrued and how they planned to take it before yearend.  Several immediate and simultaneous thoughts went through my head -- 1) is this an exempt or nonexempt employee, 2) where is this being recorded, and 3) what if this employee gets redeployed/termed or transfers jobs--would they expect to take this time off or in the case of a nonexempt employee be paid for it?  Unfortunately, we have no way to validate comp time since we have no tracking mechanism for this.  In the case of a nonexempt employee this could become a very risky situation.  Compensatory Time Off for Non-Exempt Employees  Compensatory time off for non-exempt employees must be used in the same pay period in which it is accrued.  If an employee works overtime in a workweek which falls at the beginning of a pay period, then the employee can take time off with pay in a workweek later in the same pay period.  If an employee cannot use all of the accrued comp time by the end of the pay period, then the employee must be paid for the comp time in the paycheck for the pay period.  Any comp time which is used by nonexempt employees must be provided at the rate of one and one-half hours off with pay for every overtime hour which is worked.  There is no cost savings in the use of comp time.    Compensatory Time Off for Exempt Employees  If an employer promises comp time to an overtime exempt employee, then the employee may be able to enforce the promise of additional compensation even though the employee was not entitled to overtime pay.  Enron's Overtime Pay and Reimbursement Policy states ""Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay.""   Responding to an exempt employee's claim that he or she is entitled to comp time is often difficult because records are not generally kept of exempt employee's hours of work--(I plan to devote my next communication to tracking an exempt employee's hours worked as this is often an area of confusion).  The provisions of comp time may also adversely affect the ""salary"" which must be paid for white-collar employees to be overtime exempt.   I hope this communication will be helpful and I welcome any feedback or suggested topics you may want additional information about.  Please feel free to pass this on to anyone I overlooked in your respective groups.

As reque= sted, I set out below what I believe are the significant issues in relation=  to the relevant documents.=20  Preface to policy  *     In relation to the ""Prefatory Statement To Employee Data Protection P= olicy"" I note that this prefatory statement and the associated policy relat= e only to employee data and it is therefore unclear what steps Enron is tak= ing in respect of other data.  *     The last paragraph on the first page of the prefatory statement state= s that ""we are implementing the Employee Data Protection Policy attached to=  this Preface in an effort to assure employees and the appropriate regulato= ry agencies that we have in place data protections that are comparable to t= hose mandated by the Directive and other similar data protection laws"".  En= ron's obligation is to ensure that it complies with applicable data protect= ion laws.  To the extent that the policy only relates to employee data it w= ill not satisfy regulatory authorities or others that Enron is complying wi= th data protection laws in respect of any other data.  Policy  *     In relation to the policy itself, this does not identify or require e= mployees to comply in a comprehensive way with the various data protection = principles under the UK Act or the Directive.  Where principles are reflect= ed, the relevant provisions are on occasion slightly misleading.  For examp= le, the policy says that data is kept ""as long as necessary"".  The relevant=  data protection principle is that data should ""not be kept for longer than=  is necessary"" (a difference in emphasis). It seems to me that the policy i= s seeking largely to fulfil the requirement that individuals (employees in = this case) are properly informed of the processing of their data.  This req= uires Enron to inform individuals of the data controller (or its representa= tive), the purposes of processing and any other information to enable the p= rocessing to be fair.  In this regard, section 2 identifies the purposes of=  processing employee data.  Have checks been made to ensure this is an accu= rate and reasonably comprehensive description of the purposes for which emp= loyee data are processed?  *     Section 2 of the policy states that Enron companies do not access sen= sitive data ""in making employment decisions described in (i) and (ii)"" of s= ection 2.  To what extent is any sensitive employee data processed by Enron=  and to what extent have any notices or consents been given or obtained in = relation to such data?=20   *     In relation to the consent sought in section 3, this does not clearly=  seek consent to international transfers of data.  The policy also seeks to=  deem consent stating that by continuing as an employee of an Enron Company= "" the employee agrees to the use of his or her data as described in the pol= icy.  It is unclear whether such a deemed consent would be effective.  To w= hat extent is it possible to seek employees' actual consent (e.g. as part o= f an annual agreement by employees to abide by applicable group codes of co= nduct, guidelines or policies)?  *     In relation to section 3, this provides that Enron may expand the use= s to which employee data is put as described in this policy.  Unless employ= ees are properly informed of or aware of any such changes, it is unlikely t= hat any such changes will be lawful.  *     In relation to section 4, this states that ""we have not established g= eneral guidelines for the use, disclosure and retention of personal data. O= bviously, the purposes for which we will process personal data, the type of=  personal data in question and relevant regulatory requirements will guide = us in such matters"".  It is unclear what the purpose of this wording is bea= ring in mind that it would not offer any comfort to regulators that applica= ble data protection laws are being complied with.  From an employee's persp= ective, it is not very informative.  *     In the second paragraph in section 4, the policy provides that each i= ndividual who is retained by an Enron Company is responsible for ensuring t= hat he or she takes into account the principles established by this policy.=   As mentioned above the policy does not clearly address all relevant princ= iples identified in the Directive. =20  Master Agreement  *     The master data protection agreement only relates to intra-group tran= sfers of employee data.  What is happening in relation to transfers of othe= r data?  *     To the extent that consents by employees to processing and internatio= nal transfer of their data have been or can be obtained (e.g. through emplo= yees agreeing to a policy that addresses this issue and) then this document=  would not be necessary as relevant conditions permitting international tra= nsfers would have been satisfied.  To what extent can employees' consents b= e obtained to international transfers?  *     The provisions in this document appear to be based on the European EU=  model contract.  However, they do not cover all the relevant provisions of=  the model contract and to the extent that relevant provisions are covered,=  they tend to be paraphrased in slightly inconsistent ways.  As a result, t= he question is to what extent can this document be relied on to ensure ""ade= quate safeguards"".  The EU decision adopting to the model contract states t= hat ""the scope of this Decision is limited to establishing that the clauses=  in the Annex may be used by a controller established in the Community in o= rder to adduce adequate safeguards within the meaning of article 26 (ii) of=  Directive 95/46/EC"".  The Decision does not state that similar terms adopt= ed by particular entities will also offer adequate safeguards.  The more th= at the Master Agreement differs from the EU model contract, the less certai= nly an entity can have that there are adequate safeguards in place.=20  *     Although many provisions in the model contract have been paraphrased = in the Master Agreement, I could not find provisions in the Master Agreemen= t corresponding with a number of provisions in the model contract, for exam= ple: clauses 2, 3, 4(b),  5(e), 6, 7(1), 9 and 11 of the model contract, an= d the detailed description of the processing in Appendix 1 of  the model co= ntract.  In relation to Appendix 2, it is unclear where the following are r= eflected:  Appendix 2, paragraph 3;  the various information requirements i= n paragraph 6(a) and paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of Appendix 2.   *     In relation to the Data Importer - is Enron Corp. the only relevant = data importer of employee data from Europe?  *     In relation to the definitions in the master data protection agreemen= t, it is unclear why this does not use the same definition as the model con= tract.   For example, the definition of ""data processor"" identifies relevan= t entities that are ""not a member of the corporate group"".  Why are Enron C= orporate Group members/excluded from the definition of data processors?=20  *     The master data protection agreement does not address the question of=  sensitive data and no definition of sensitive data is included.  Are any s= ensitive data transferred?=20  *     In relation to section 3(e), this lists again the various purposes of=  processing employee data.  The description of relevant processing should p= resumably track the description in the policy to which Enron Group companie= s are bound.  It is therefore unclear why it is necessary to list again the=  various purposes of employee processing rather than simply cross-referring=  to the policy.   *     Paragraph 3(f) states that data exporter will be responsible for obta= ining any necessary consents from the data subjects with respect of the pro= cessing of personal data.  To the extent that consents are obtained they sh= ould also cover international transfers of data.  To the extent that approp= riate consents to the international transfer of data is obtained then this = agreement is unnecessary.  Again therefore the question is to what extent c= onsents to international transfer of data by employees can be or will be ob= tained?   *     Clause 3(g) provides that the purposes for which data may be processe= d can be expanded and that the data importer will endeavour to inform the d= ata exporter of additional purposes of using such data.  This does not conf= orm with the strict ""purpose limitation"" in paragraph 1 of appendix 2 of th= e model contract.  *     Whereas clause 5(b) of the model contract entitles importers to eithe= r abide by the principles identified in the model contract or the laws of t= he data exporter (which need to be annexed to the contract), the master agr= eement addresses both these requirements (see in particular paragraph 5(b))= .  As a result, to this extent it imposes a potentially higher standard tha= n that required by the model contract.  How does Enron Corp propose to comp= ly with the laws of multiple countries as per clause 5(b)?  *     Clause 9(b) provides that the ""data processor will observe the obliga= tions of a data controller"" - this might mean for example that a data proce= ssor needs to register for data protection purposes with applicable data pr= otection regulators.  What legal obligation is this clause seeking to addre= ss?  The above comments are based on the UK Act however it is likely that simila= r obligations will apply in other jurisdictions.   In light of the above, the key issues are as follows:  *     To what extent is it possible to obtain consents from employees to in= ternational transfers?  To the extent this is possible then it is likely th= at an intra-group agreement will not be necessary; *     To the extent that such an agreement is necessary, we would normally = suggest that this is done substantially on the terms of the model contract.=   To the extent that the relevant terms differ from the model contract then=  there is a risk that the relevant provisions do not offer ""adequate safegu= ards"" as provided by the Commission decision.  If however, Enron proposes t= o make transfers under the terms of the master agreement then I would sugge= st the master agreement should be reviewed in detail so as to ensure that t= o the fullest extent possible, it accurately reflects all the relevant prov= isions of the model contract more closely, in particular in relation to rig= hts of relevant data subjects to enforce the contract as a party to it.

Then, in a relative heartbeat -- the thr= ee days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- her opinion of her employer=  did an about-face. The reason: Her bosses fumbled the crisis, the manager = says. Though nearly all offices and schools in her city closed early Sept. = 11, employees at her firm who had to leave early to pick up children or for=  other reasons met a snide or grudging response. One senior executive said,=  ""If you really need to, you can,"" the manager says. Those who stayed but k= ept one eye on the TV news were criticized for failing to focus. Managers e= xpressed no concern for employees' worries about traveling on business. ""I = expected much more compassion,"" says the marketing manager. The experience = has her considering jumping ship for another employer, she says. Handling t= he aftermath of the terrorist attacks posed an acid test for employers, oft= en fundamentally changing the employer-employee relationship. The mass emot= ions aroused by the tragedy were so primal -- fear, grief, anger and the dr= ive to protect loved ones -- that any managerial missteps took on larger-th= an-life importance. EMPLOYEES, RIGHTLY or wrongly, believed they were seein= g bosses' true colors. Their conclusions about what they saw either deepene= d their commitment or damaged it beyond repair. ""This is a sea change. Peop= le are seeing how important basic, trustworthy relationships are,"" says Fre= derick Reichheld, a director emeritus of Bain & Co. and author of ""Loyalty = Rules."" Some employers rose to the occasion. Lorna Paine, a sales executive=  in Houston for Business Objects, a San Jose, Calif., software concern, say= s her managers, from the chief executive on down, encouraged people ""to go = home to our families, do whatever you need to do"" after the attack. One vic= e president called Ms. Paine to give her his home number in case she needed=  anything. ""I've been working for almost 20 years. I've never had a vice pr= esident give me his home number. Never,"" she says. ""I am committed to this = company like never before."" At Trane Co., Doug Young, an asset management s= pecialist, says his employer's concern for employees, reflected in frequent=  e-mails, an outpouring of encouragement and educational materials, and big=  charitable contributions, deepened his commitment. Calling it his personal=  ""moment of truth,"" Mr. Young says his employer ""provided comfort and made = me proud."" Others fumbled the ball. At a Chicago consulting firm, a senior = supervisor coldly ordered employees on Sept. 11 to return to business as us= ual, one consultant there says. ""What we needed was to stop and say, 'OK, w= e're going to take a deep breath and think about this,' "" she adds. When sh= e weighs long-term plans, ""I will remember this situation and how my firm d= ealt with it."" If employees seem a little touchy, they are. As discussed la= st month in this column, the terrorist crisis knocked millions of workers a=  rung or two lower on the Maslovian hierarchy of human needs. Now, they're = focused on life's most basic requirements, including safety, security and c= onnections with others. These spark far stronger emotions than the higher-l= evel priorities of months past, such as recognition or achievement. VAULT.C= OM, a Web site that posts message boards on companies, drew about 50 postin= gs from employees protesting their postattack treatment, says Vault Inc.'s = Mark Oldman. Hundreds more came from human-resource managers asking for adv= ice. Indeed, several companies found themselves pilloried in the news media=  for simply following established policies -- for example, requiring employ= ees to account for time off taken Sept. 11. Embedded in the crisis is an op= portunity for employers to rebuild damaged loyalty. Fewer than one in four = workers are truly loyal to their companies and committed to staying, says W= alker Information, a customer- and employee-satisfaction researcher in Indi= anapolis. That could easily change. In an unusual twist, Walker received an=  e-mail request from an employee of one of its clients, a telecommunication= s company, to change the survey she had submitted about her employer. Her c= ompany handled the Sept. 11 crisis so well, the employee wrote, that she wa= nted to express her newfound loyalty. While loyalty may not seem to matter = amid hundreds of thousands of layoffs, research suggests it does. Loyalty s= hapes people's choices not only about where to work, but also about how lon= g, hard and wholeheartedly to apply their mental energies -- the fuel that = drives the New Economy. Employee attitudes also color customer relationship= s. ""When the only thing keeping employees on the job is fear, or golden han= dcuffs, those employees don't go the extra mile,"" Walker's Mark Drizin says= . In a reeling economy, going the extra mile is just what employers need. B= ut they're going to have to show some heart to get there.

As I mentioned, we do not have any lawyers actually resident in Mississippi, so we did the work here.  This analysis seems comprehensive enough.  Let me know if you need anything else. Kerry E Notestine  Littler Mendelson, PC  1900 Chevron Tower  1301 McKinney Street  Houston, Texas 77010  713.652.4748  713.951.9212 (fax)  knotestine@littler.com  www.littler.com  -----Original Message-----  From:   Zimmermann, Ashley  Sent:   Monday, October 08, 2001 7:51 PM  To:     Notestine, Kerry  Subject:        ENA agreement- review for compliance with Mississippi law  Generally, the agreement is compliant with Mississippi law.  It is not hard to comply with Mississippi law when it comes to employment agreements.  Mississippi is pretty much the opposite of California in regard to employee rights.  Mississippi does not have many restrictions.  Plaintiffs' employment attorneys would probably starve in Mississippi if it weren't for federal laws. Mississippi allows non-competes and protection of trade secrets and confidential business information.  It has a pretty broad view of what is included in that category, so I think the agreement is ok in that regard.  Specifically, the case law says that a covenant not to compete may be enforced if ""necessary for the protection of [the employer's] business and goodwill.""  See Texas Rd. Boring Co. of La.-Miss. v. Parker, 194 So.2d 885 (Miss. 1967).  The validity and enforceability of a non-compete is predicated upon the reasonableness and specificity of its terms, primarily, the duration of the restriction and its geographic scope.  See Redd Pest Control Co. v. Heatherly, 248 Miss. 34, 157 So.2d 133 (1963).  To be enforceable, the covenant must strike a balance between the interests of the employer and the employee, and its enforcement must not pose a threat to the public of monopoly or unfair competition.  See Empiregas, Inc. of Kosciusko v. Bain, 599 So.2d 971, 975 (Miss. 1992).   Incidentally, even if the court found the terms and categories of a non-compete to be too broadly defined, that would not be a problem because Mississippi courts can blue pencil those types of things to make non-competes enforceable.  The time and geographic restriction in this agreement would most likely be found to be reasonable under Mississippi law, as other courts have upheld similar restrictions.  The only concern I have in that regard is that the agreement says it will be enforceable even against an employee who is termed without cause, and Mississippi law holds that Court's should not enforce non-competes if the employee was terminated in an arbitrary or capricious manner or in bad faith.  However, I don't think that means we need to change the language in the contract, I just think you need to advise the client of that fact so it cannot expect to be able to terminate an employee in bad faith and still enforce the non-compete.    Mississippi allows for employment agreements to be arbitrated.  Thus, the arbitration provision is fine.  The only thing I might add is a clause which says, ""The arbitrator selected may not have any interest in the subject matter in dispute, nor can he be related by consanguinity or affinity to the parties entering into this agreement"" because that is a requirement under Mississippi law. Incidentally, my only other concern is that the agreement says it will be governed by Texas law.  Choice of law is an unsettled area in Mississippi when it comes to employment agreements/non-competes in Mississippi, so there is no reason why the client cannot insist on such a provision.  However, the client should probably be advised that such an area of law is always subject to change and it might be enforced by a Mississippi court regardless of what the agreement says.

To that end EEL has rolled out a voluntary redundancy program.  Following suit, Metals NA is also rolling out a Voluntary Separation Program to all staff in the US and we want to include those employees in Montreal.  I've been working with Michelle Cash to finalise the plan, attached are two documents that will give you a summary of the plan.  In essence, its 2 wks base pay per year of service PLUS 2 wks base pay per 10K of salary for an executed Waiver and Release.  Do you see any issues with making the Montreal staff eligible for this plan?  A general employee meeting is being held tomorrow to announce the roll out and Monday will be the 2 wk kick of the program when employees will receive more detail of the plan.  Practically speaking, we anticipate keeping only 2-3 people in Montreal.  Let me know what you think.

However, I firmly believe that this is not the real reason, the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager (Mr. Lowell Bezanis,Manager, EGM) who, I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me.  I have since filed a written complaint to Enron's EEO Committee.   This committee, having investigated the case, has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings.  As a consequence, my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected.     If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job, but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past 8 years.  The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for 30 days.  I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner, unnecessarily, since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife (not only towards myself but also to other employees, some of whom have left as a result) in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions.   I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability, often receiving compliments from clients.  This cannot be the only way to solve this issue!      The Trigger and Retaliation.      Since Mr. Bezanis has been my line manager, internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me.  On August 28, I attended a class of 'natural gas structuring'. Mr. Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs, however, I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge.   I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms. Shanna Funkhouser (my HR representative).  The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before Ms.Funkhouser.  Mr. Bezanis and Mr. Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered.  Feeling intimidated, I requested that I meet with Ms. Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO, as agreed previously.  She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment.  I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination. Ms. Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following:    -        the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work   -        that I was making jobapplications by company email   Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment.   As a manager, Mr. Bezanis has:   -        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals.  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval.   -        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance (PRC process) which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers' and clients' by review.  Until now, Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results.   -        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an 'energy index' as a potential useful trading instrument.  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite, but the reaction of Mr. Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first.  I was banned by him from developing the idea further.   Discrimination.    It is our belief that Mr. Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees, especially competent women, as equals.  His rough, stifling, and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms. Courtney Campbell, the other only woman reporting to him.     Hostile Working Environment.      The working environment under Mr. Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one. Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common. Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence.  We are managed by ""threats"" rather than constructive comments.     Wrongful Termination.   Knowing I was unfairly treated, Enron HR has not helped address my concerns.  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process.  Ms. Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair, but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases.  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers, no matter how wrong they are.  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time.    I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case.

How will my immigration status be affected when my employment ceases?   A:  Your work permit is specific to Enron and is not transferable to any other employer without additional processing by the INS.  A non-immigrant (H-1B, L-1, TN, etc.) is out of status once s/he has been terminated.  Once the non-immigrant is out of status, in theory, s/he should depart the US as soon as possible.  If the non-immigrant can find a new employer and file within approximately 30 to 60 days from the date of termination, the INS has generally overlooked the violation of the maintenance of status.  Keep in mind this is not a hard and fast rule, and the INS has the ability to enforce shorter or longer periods on a case-by-case basis.  If you are offered another job in the US your prospective employer will have to apply for a new work permit on your behalf. If you do not get another job in the US and you wish to remain here then you must seek permission to stay on other grounds.  Upon termination, the foreign national should contact an attorney and schedule a time for a full consultation (in-person whenever possible) regarding all issues.  There are often many issues which need to be addressed as each person's immigration issues are unique.   I hope this is what you are looking for.  Let me know if we need anything else?

"Hi Michelle,  The presentation went as well as it could.  There was quite a bit of stunned silence, but the questions are already starting to trickle in.  One particular question on unemployment insurance I'm not familiar with, hoping you or Drew can help.  Since the VSP is effectively a voluntary election, would employees qualify for unemployment insurance, specifically in New York State.  Under the involuntary program, is the severance payment offset by unemployment compensation?  You can see where this question is leading, some people may be hedging their bets on the time value of the money.

So I have scrubbed the data as much as possible and am attaching the business objects reports so that Kathy can run under her ID to capture the HR data.  This will prevent her from creating the report from scratch.  I would like to prepare a list of some of the required analysis and be included in the conversation with Jeanerette when providing instructions.  I will send this to you in the am.  Kathy,  If you can run the reports, export to excel and deliver a file to Michelle Cash tomorrow I would greatly appreciate it.  Please let me know if you make any changes to the query so that I stay in sync as I generate other reports.     << File: Diversity - Mid Year 2001 Download for calculating Standard deviation (expats).rep >>  << File: Diversity - Mid Year 2001 Download for calculating Standard deviation.rep >>   Please note the following challenges. Although HRGIS-WP and the Demographics Universe have a lot of the same datafields, Felecia recommended that I merge the performance data into the Demographics data.  I was unable to do this in BO because the universes are not compatible and BO only allows you to combine queries from the same universe. Exporting to Excel is really too manually intensive and I am trying not to create additional databases as done in the past. My plan is to document the processes, identify the going forward requirements and submit for automation.  The expats data in the UK is coming from SAP-UK and they do not configure for ethnicity on that version.  So in HRGIS-WP the ethnicity is showing 'Unknown'.  UK Expats also have two different records in the data warehouse and they are not tied together in anyway.  I manually identified the ethnicity that resides in the US version and coded the ethnicity as a variable in the expat query. There is still a lot of blank ethnicity fields and I will be send the HR Generalist a note to update the source system.   In trying to identify US employees, I came across potential mapping issues with the currency code.  Questions have been forwarded to Kathy Schultea for review.  There was one expat employee filtered out that was not on US payroll but showed his salary as USD.  A positive note:  Today Leticia Barrios provided me with an update to the data mart which now shows the data source.  Although the problem is not resolved, this made the scrubbing much easier.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Huynh, Catherine   Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 11:38 AM To: Cash, Michelle Subject: RE: Enron Metals North America Voluntary Separation  Michelle,  I'm quite happy with the lay out of the plan (great flexibility), but have just a few comments/questions.  Article 2.3, Can we make such a broad statement that is so biased toward the Company?  Article 3.1, I think the max payment is 56 weeks.  Article 5.2, Under failure to meet performance, can we reduce the 45 day period and reference oral notification as well as written notification?  One of my concerns is, if we notify someone that we accept their Voluntary application, but need them to work for the next 3-4 months, the employees' motivation level might be very low which will effect their performance level.  Or perhaps we can build a statement in to the Separation and Release Agreement stating that the completion of their transition of their role needs to be satisfactorily completed to receive the separation pay.  Also, somewhat related, do we expect to have the involuntary severance plan amended anytime this year?  As I'm working out the next stage of involuntary severance reductions, just need to know if the calculation is likely to change.  Thanks Michelle.

Somehow the waiver was never put in place for David and Louise when they came over.  I discovered this when working on the package for Pickering.    David has agreed to take the agreement to Louise and Mark, once he is comfortable.  We've gone back and forth with David a couple of times.  He now says he'll sign if we take out item 1 and the last sentence of 4.   I think we need item 1, but I've adjusted it on the attached to try to meet our needs.  David's concern is that the current wording puts ""salt in the wounds"" regarding the benefits they are giving up, or may give up in the future.  He wants to keep it simple.

"Can we discuss?   Thanks!   Mary -----Original Message----- From: Diomedes Christodoulou [mailto:diomedes@cumulouscapital.com] Sent: Saturday, October 20, 2001 12:03 PM To: Joyce, Mary Cc: Novak, John Subject: Enron payments   Mary Joyce,   I hope all is well with you.    I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.   After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the ""changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November"".    As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear.   These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24.   Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.   I look forward to hearing from you,   Regards,     Diomedes Christodoulou.",michelle.cash@enron.com,mary.joyce@enron.com,FW: Enron payments,2001-10-22 06:44:47-07:00,received

"Good luck.  I would like the message to be even stronger than that -- he is not supposed to hire any outside counsel at all, for anything -- that is supposed to be done through legal department, per Jim Derrick's strictly-enforced rules.  He knows this and continues to violate that rule.  I suggest that he must hear a strong message, with disciplinary potential if he does it again.  Otherwise, this will have to be escalated to Derrick, since it continues to happen again despite my requests that he not do it.  In fact, he never contacts me for anything, which makes me nervous.  I would suggest that you would want him to have the same processes that we have in the rest of Enron regarding terminations of employment, which is that they go through legal if they are for any reason other than ROF.  That way, we may be able to catch some of the issues before they become more significant.  Similarly, I would like to be informed of employee relations issues that could bubble up into legal concerns.  I don't have much optimism for this, but still would like to ask for it!

David has agreed to take the agreement to Louise and Mark, once he is comfortable.  We've gone back and forth with David a couple of times.  He now says he'll sign if we take out item 1 and the last sentence of 4.   I think we need item 1, but I've adjusted it on the attached to try to meet our needs.

I did not inquire specifically about NuTech--I assume Michelle is doing that.  Teresa      Aaron:  Based on our conversations, it is my understanding that the compensation committee has asked to review compensation plans for our affiliates if we own approximately 50% or more of the company.  The determination of exactly which plans must go to the committee will be made by Mary Joyce upon receipt of a bullet point presentation of the key terms of the plan.  The committee would likely review any compensation plan pursuant to which (i) employees receive equity interests without making capital contributions in cash or other property with reasonably equivalent value to the equity interests, (ii) employees receive equity interests prior to Enron recovering its investment, or (iii) employees are to be offered employment agreements with terms that are not within ""Enron norms.""  In addition, all significant terms of the compensation plan are to be disclosed in the DASH.  Do I understand this all corrrectly?  Is there anything I have omitted?

"SICK LEAVE POLICY   Policy  To keep the business and each department running smoothly and efficiently, it is important that every employee be on the job on time regularly.  For this reason, careful attention is given to promptness, absence record and overall dependability.  Enron recognizes, however, that an employee may occasionally be unable to come to work due to injury or illness.  As a result, the Sick Leave policy is designed to provide protection to employees against loss of income during pregnancy, illness or injury.  Eligible employees who are unable to perform their jobs due to pregnancy, illness or injury are eligible to receive sick leave pay for up to 1,040 hours (6 months) in a twelve month period, assuming certain procedures are followed.    Effective January 1, 2002, the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) runs concurrently with Enron's Sick Leave policy.  An employee who is still disabled after using the 1,040 hours of sick leave pay ends may qualify for long term disability insurance.  Sick days cannot be carried over from one calendar year to the next and employees are not paid for sick days either at the end of the calendar year or upon termination.    Proposed Policy Link  Procedures -  To be eligible for sick leave pay, employees unable to report to work must telephone their supervisor directly, each day of their absence, as far in advance as possible.  If their supervisor is not available, the employee's human resources representative should be contacted.  If an employee is unable to make the call personally, a family member or a friend should contact the supervisor.  The supervisor or human resources representative must be contacted each day of absence.  An employee who fails to contact his/her immediate supervisor or human resources representative may forfeit the sick leave pay and may be considered as having voluntarily resigned.  This policy must be followed unless an exception has been made for a particular absence, and a written memo to this effect has been sent to the employees' human resources representative.  On the fifth day of continued absence due to injury or illness, in addition to notifying the employee's supervisor or human resources representative, the employee must also attain a doctor's certification indicating the estimated date in which the employee will be able to return to work.

"Michelle -  Kim and I will be speaking with Jubran at 4:00 pm today.  If it is OK, I would like to offer COBRA costs of $7500 gross (current expenses for benefits are about $700).  Is this OK?  Also, with regards to section 5.3 of this agreement, can we add a clause that says he will be compensated for his time if needed to assist with litigation issues.....not sure if we have done this in the past, however, he has raised this as a concern.

"Michelle, We may reap the most benefit by having all the site HR Managers, Site Safety Supervisors/Nurse Practitioners, Mike Indivero, Tony Bolar Softich(Safety), Steve Olenik(Safety), Sean Mayer(Construction), Frank Petty(Director of Construction), Mike Ranz(VP Construction), Bob Black(Manager Of Projects), maybe a few other home office construction managers selected by Mike Ranz or Frank Petty in attendance.

You may even want to invite whoever is John Gillis's boss(or his designee) to sit in to emphasize the importance of this issue. Too often I hear ""Enron has plenty of money"" and ""Thats why we have lawyers"" -the truth being we are the guardians of our stockholders assets and we have a fudiciary responsibility to protect those assets for the health and well being of the company, the stockholders and the employees of Enron Corp. My experience has been that we do a good deal of back stabbing and finger pointing when HR, Safety and Construction get together and meet on anything. Liability/Settlement checks regardless of the amount needs to be an issue along with the improvement of the employment offer process and who is authorized to make decisions effecting employment offers. In the end if supervisors or managers fail to act prudently and in the best interest of the company then there is a penalty. The penalty being they won't get the opportunity to lose more of the companies money by making reckless decisions. Thats the approach I would take with these people.

"David,  You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance.    The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows:   ""Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________.""  This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria.  Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1, 2, 3, distributed as 10-80-10), then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria.    Given the huge change in our process, however, there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead, we should look at the top 25% of the peer group, instead of performance criteria, even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted.  As a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C).  That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus.  If there is a decision not to break  down the middle 80 further, then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high. For those employees, a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process.    Of course, it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race, sex, national origin, age, etc. in this process.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.     After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the ""changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November"".      As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear.     These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments,otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24.     Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.     I look forward to hearing from you,     Regards,        Diomedes Christodoulou. ",michelle.cash@enron.com,john.novak@enron.com,Enron payments,2001-10-24 06:36:57-07:00,received

I would agree that I should not be able to work on a deal that I was working on as a direct competitor (say ENE was executing a pre-pay with a client - I would not be able to go to an investment bank and compete for the same deal), but to put in a restriction on general corporate finance type activity seems overly broad.  Can you confirm that the concept is that not to compete on deals I have been working on.  2) I would like to discuss the assignment language further.  I do not have an issue with assignment to an affiliate, my issue is with the ability to assign to any other entity.  Based on how the contract is drafted, ENE could assign the contract to anyone, including in the extreme say 7-Eleven.  Not that I would expect this to happen and I understand that I would be getting paid during the time period, however, the work that I could be doing or firm working for, could make me unemployable beyond the contract period.  I am signing this contract and agreeing to stay with ENE or an affiliate, not any other entity.  What is the definition of affiliate (is this the same as used in the typical ENE docs, which ties to control) ?  3) On vesting.  My view is that I am signing a 2 year contract and the compensation should vest during that period (i.e. 1/3 now, 1/3 after 1 year and 1/3 at the end of the 2nd year, or 50% after yr. 1 and 50% after yr. 2) I would like to discuss your thoughts on this issue.

"My draft response would be:  The objective is for BU and Functional leads to identify their top and bottom 10% for discussion surrounding the issues you raise, as well as what the leadership believe is necessary in order to meet their business goals and whether these people could be better deployed in other areas or on other challenges. In relation to promotions, we would expect to see a high correlation between those promoted and those highlighted in the top 10%, however, leadership will review nominations for promotion from both the top 10% and the 80%. As a point of clarification, promotions of non-exempt employees takes place at outside this process and is a matter for the individual BU's leadership and supervisors.

I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which    have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to    contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and    Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The    payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.     After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after    leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to    the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South    America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works    with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November,    maybe even until late November as the ""changes in management at Enron    require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee    which would convene in early or late November"".     As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with    Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages    with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this    very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this    email to make sure that my position is clear.     These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no    reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation    Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been    extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron    up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the    process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these    payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions    that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday,    October 24.     Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the    appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.     I look forward to hearing from you,     Regards,      Diomedes Christodoulou.    ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

I realize that you must both be    extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself in a    position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email below to    your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the bottom line    is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to me    and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not even    responding to my requests for information.     I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to handle    this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to    make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the    unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already causing    me serious  problems and potential losses.     I look forward to your response.     Thanks and hope to see you soon.     Diomedes.     -----Original Message-----    From: Diomedes Christodoulou [mailto:diomedes@cumulouscapital.com]    Sent: 20 October 200118:03    To: 'mary.joyce@enron.com'    Cc: 'John.Novak@enron.com'    Subject: Enron payments     Mary Joyce,     I hope all is well with you.     I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which    have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to    contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and    Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The    payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.     After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after    leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to    the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South    America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works    with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November,    maybe even until late November as the ""changes in management at Enron    require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee    which would convene in early or late November"".     As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with    Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages    with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this    very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this    email to make sure that my position is clear.     These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no    reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation    Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been    extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron    up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the    process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these    payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions    that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday,    October 24.     Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the    appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.     I look forward to hearing from you,     Regards,      Diomedes Christodoulou.    ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

" Dear  Michelle:        On Tuesday, October 23, I met with Christina Solomon, counsel for Doug  Miller.  The elusive Liz Miller failed to attend, having been called at the  last minute into an all-day meeting.  We have tentatively agreed that we  will meet next week.        Despite Liz Miller's absence, I believe that the meeting was productive.  I  learned the following information:        1.    Doug Miller claims that there are three power grids that  are unrelated, that he worked only in the East for ENA and works only in Texas  for Calpine.  Thus, he claims that his duties and activities do not overlap  in any way with those he performed for ENA.        2.    Calpine did not know of Miller's non-compete at the time  Miller was hired because he believed it had expired.  He brought it to  Calpine's attention immediately upon being contacted by ENA.        3.    Christina argued, as she did in the answer and  counterclaim, that the non-compete agreement was fatally overbroad, as Miller  never had any duties involving the majority of the activities from which the  non-compete purports to bar him.         In response, I told her the following:            1.    We do not accept Miller's assertion that simply working in  another region will sufficiently insulate our trade secrets, since strategies  may not be confined to a single region.        2.    I pointed out to her that Miller's contract very clearly  states that the non-compete extends three months after employment even if the  contract term has expired.  I also pointed out that he was reminded of his  non-compete orally several times by ENA personnel upon his  resignation.        3.    I explained that the non-compete had been enforced on many  occasions and that it was carefully crafted with an eye to protecting the many  trade secrets to which Miller may have had access.  I argued that  strategies concerning one aspect of ENA's business might impact many other areas  and that, as such, the non-compete was not overly broad.  [She asked what  trade secrets we were trying to protect!!  I, of course, declined to  answer.]  Despite the fact that I believe that these facts are clearly  stated in our petition, she confessed to not having viewed the situation from  the ""trade secret perspective.""            We ended the meeting with her stating that Calpine and Miller were both  interested in trying to resolve the matter and that she welcomes a proposal from  us.  While she did not elaborate, I believe that they would entertain a  suggestion of some sort of limitation on his activities for some short  period of time.        Please let me have your thoughts about this matter.   Thanks.   Best  regards, Linda  Broocks",michelle.cash@enron.com,lbroocks@ogwb.com,Enron v. Miller,2001-10-25 15:20:13-07:00,received

Our goal is to be able to automatically deduct any outstanding balances (tax advances, expense advances/loans) from assignees when they terminate.  The collections are usually offset against the vacation payout & severance.    If EMPLOYEE's assignment by COMPANY, as described in this Assignment Letter, is terminated by COMPANY or by EMPLOYEE, upon such termination, regardless of the reason therefore, all compensation and all benefits to EMPLOYEE under this Assignment Letter shall terminate; and any outstanding balances due COMPANY will be deducted from any remaining payments due EMPLOYEE.  If EMPLOYEE's employment hereunder is terminated by COMPANY, then EMPLOYEE may be eligible for severance payments as set forth and governed by the Enron Corp. Severance Pay Plan (Restated January 1, 1993).  ...  Tim,   I added the wording to Section VIII of the letter, Item F, Terminations.  Attached is the full text for reference.

" Dear  Michelle:       I  just finished my conference call with Liz Miller (counsel for Calpine),  Christina Solomon, and Steve Schuler (Steve is co-counsel for Miller with  Christina).  Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at  the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary  concerns.  She made the following points:                    (1)    She has talked with several different people at various  levels of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats  the power grids as ""completely different"" regions, strategies for which are not  shared internally among those regions.                (2)    She asserts that ""how we do it at Calpine is totally  different from Enron,"" since Calpine is ""trading around a portfolio of assets  that we own.""  She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets,  trades differently.  When I replied that Enron does have power generation  assets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is  vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power  generation assets.            (3)    Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in  ""Urcot"" (sp??) in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.   According to Liz, Calpine's strategies concerning these specific regions is  divorced from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the  East or West.              (4)    Liz is of the opinion that Miller ""is not senior enough  that we would be looking for what he knows.""  He has no role whatsoever in  discussing or formulating strategy for trading.  Miller, she insists, is on  the receiving end only.  He takes orders, dispatching and scheduling  solely in response to orders he receives from others.            (5)    Liz acknowledges that, were Miller in a more senior,  responsible position, she would have the same concerns we are expressing were  the tables turned.  Miller is ""so slotted,"" however, that she believes that  he is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess  (though she and Miller's attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any  critical information, that the most critical information changes on a day-to-day  basis).          We  ended the conversation with the following  understandings:           (1)    Liz  will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a non-trading function for a  period of two months or so.                      --She hastened to add, however, that trading is the only area for which  they really have any use for Miller.  She then suggested that she could  explore putting him instead in the West (""I know Enron doesn't even have a  western desk here."").  I believe that any proposal she comes back  with will entail his continuing in some trading  function.           (2)    Liz  will try to determine how Calpine might provide assurances (acceptable to  ENA) that Miller is ""on the receiving end only,"" as she asserts, such that we  would be confident that he is indeed not in a position to use any trade  secrets he may remember.                      --On this point, I was clear that I did not know either what level of assurance  ENA would require or whether this would even be a feasible  alternative.                (3)    I am to explore with ENA whether this additional  information about Calpine's difference in trading strategy and the limitations  on Miller's duties alleviates ENA's concerns about protection of its trade  secrets.                    --Liz seems to believe that if the business people really knew the information  she is giving to me, they would not be concerned about the activities of this  low level person.        Liz has asked that we reconnect later this week to exchange answers to  these inquiries.  I look forward to discussing with you our  response.        Thanks for your assistance.

"I think we have had our release reviewed by NY counsel already, but it might be a belts and suspenders idea to have Drew look at it quickly.  I agree with Lizzette's view of the persons who don't sign the release; I believe that they probably have quit.  If, however, they rescind their application before termination, it is not a voluntary term.  If the situation arises, however, I think we should reevaluate at that time.

Michelle, do you think we need to have NY counsel review the separation agreement?  On the question of rescinding the agreements, I think that an employee who rescinds a separation agreement may not be entitled to anything because the person still has voluntarily quit and isn't entitled to any severance under any plan.  But for employees who try to rescind the application for voluntary severance (ie say they don't want to quit at all), I think we've led them to believe that they can do so without repercussion.  So, I would say that they remain employees who (1) ultimately still can choose to voluntarily quit, or (2) may be selected for termination, in which case we may owe severance.  Michelle, do you agree?    --Lizzette   -----Original Message----- From:  Huynh, Catherine   Sent: Wednesday, October 31, 2001 3:08 PM To: Palmer, Lizzette; Cash, Michelle Subject: Voluntary Separation Program Update  Michelle, Lizzette,  We have extended our application deadline to 9AM Monday since many employees have been asking for more consideration time.  I expect by Tues, Weds next week we will have determined which employees applications will be accepted.  With this in mind, can I ask you to take a look at the following acceptance and rejection letters?  These were used in London's program, and will need to be edited for use in the US.  Additionally, can you send me a copy of the Separation and Release Agreement to be used for the Voluntary Program?  I would like to familiarize the business leads on what it will contain.  Can you please ensure that the Agreement contains verbiage reference payment subject to adequate performance (per the Plan document).  We anticipate that the termination dates for the first wave of employees leaving under the is Program would leave by 12/31/2001. This means that the latest I can get the Agreement to them is Nov 15 so they will have the full 45 day consideration period.  With such a narrow timeline, I will try my best to get you all the information for effected employees soon as possible so that you will have time to prepare the Agreements.  Also, what happens in the event that the employee rescinds the Separation & Release Agreement?  Do they then, by default, receive involuntary severance?

"Thanks for the thoughts.  We are getting through it.  Cameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker, his yellow rain shoes, and his red fireman's hat.  So, instead of rain boy, he was a fireman.  I must admit that he looked absolutely adorable!!  Your bash sounds like it was a lot of fun.  I wish I could get Trey to dress up, but he really isn't into that type of thing.  We went to the opera Sat. night -- Tanenhouser.  Wagner really is uptight, isn't he?  Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit -- escaped into the music.  I went to a gala last week for MD Anderson Cancer Center.  It was amazing.  Joan Lunden MC'd.  The Houston Symphony provided music.  Video from George W. Bush.  Speech by GHW Bush.  Entertainment by one of the Irish Tenors, Lyle Lovett, Dhianne Carroll (who had a costume change even though she sang only for 20 minutes!), a 300-person chior, all accompanied by the Houston Symphony.  It was quite the event.  Persons there included the former President Bush and Barbara, James Baker, Alan Simpson, lots of local celebs, and me and my brother  (one of these things is not like the other!).  Still, we had a great time.  So, not all gloom and doom around here.  Well, I'd better get back to it.

I have to admit that it makes me feel better about  not understanding my 401K statements, the fact that analysts could even get confused about financial reporting.  All is well here, we had a kick-ass Halloween party, Rich looked fantastic as the Bride of Frankenstein (costume and make-up courtesy of me!), my friend Kim took some great pics, I don't have copies yet but when I do I'll send you one. Rich wore one of my bras and he put it and we put balloons in it and I said, how's that?  Well, he said, it's tight and kinda itchs. You're good then, that's how it feels - I told him. HA!  We joined SF carshare ( www.sfcarshare.org ) and used a car for the first time this past weekend.  We used a little green new beetle to go hiking on sunday morning. It was great. You pay per hour (2.50) and per mile .45.  I don't think we will use it very often, the way our lives are we really don't need a car very often, but it will come in handy once in while, and esp for hiking during the winter - and we're hoping someone will need to picked up at the airport or something.  And we really wanted to support SF CarShare to make sure they survive.  They are non-profit.  Did Cameron wear his slicker for Halloween or did he get tired of it before that?  Rich's step sister Liz wanted her son Bennet to be a cowboy and he wanted to be a power ranger or something.  She got him the power ranger costume and let him start wearing it a month before Halloween in the hope that he would be sick of it by Halloween and consent to be a cowboy.  Not sure what happened but it sounded like a good plan.....  Say hi to Trey and Cameron for me.

"Michelle-  Good morning, and I hope that this e-mail finds you well.  The reason for my message is to follow-up with you regarding the conversation myself, Darlene Donlan, and Greg DeLuca from our organization had with you a few weeks back.  We had discussed making additions to the Enron master PWD and getting copies of Enron's Code of Ethics, background check requirements, and Enron's benefits package regarding the indemnification clause.  Darlene, who is one of TEKsystems' Controllers, sent to your attention a copy of the revised PWD with payment terms and TEKsystems' services, and Mark has been working and communicating with myself regarding the other requested information.  I just wanted to follow-up with you to see what additional steps, if any, that TEKsystems may need to take in order to continue moving forward in the contract execution process.  If there is any additional information you may require of us on our end, please let me know and I will be happy to help assist in any way possible.  I know that you are extremely busy, and that you probably have other, more pressing matters to spend your time on.  Any feedback you could provide would be appreciated  and most helpful.

I tried to call you but got to your voice mail so I am sending you this email to clarify some questions I have.  Please confirm that when you mention the ""processing of the ECI payments"" you refer to the actual wire transfers and not to the process of confirming the amounts based on the ECI-Enron contracts - which I hope is complete by now.  Also, when you refer to the ECI payments does that mean that the Employment Agreement payment amounts are still under review? If that is the case and in the interest of gaining time please proceed with the payments of the ECI amounts which I take it are simpler to calculate (they depend on a formula and not on net income calculations like the Employment Agreement payments) and we can deal with the Employment Agreement payments later. Obviously if you have performed all the calculations for both payments I would prefer to receive the entire amount.  I realize this is a hectic time at Enron but unfortunately these payments are VERY late and as I described in my previous emails I have been postponing closing an important transaction which has considerable value to me for months now. Unless I receive at least the ECI related payments immediately I will be obliged to unwind other investments which may be done at a considerable cost to me.

"Vicki,  As mentioned in my voice mail on Friday, we have received a lawsuit filed by Michael Lindert against Enron Corp., EESO, and EES, Inc., in which he basically claims that he is due unpaid commissions.  He seeks damages of $1 million.  Jim Derrick passed this lawsuit to me, but let me know if you want me to manage it on behalf of EES.    I have contacted Chicago counsel (for information, not retention, purposes) to determine the answer date, which is 30 days.  I do not believe that we have been properly served, however, so we appear to have additional time.  The suit was filed 11/1, and we received it sometime last week, via cover letter to Ken Lay from Lindert (rather bizzarre, if you ask me).   The law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiff's firm; it actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in Cook County.  The case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of citizenship.  According to the Seyfarth, Shaw lawyers I contacted on Friday, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Law Division is not a place where we would want to be, and federal court is preferable.

I tried to call you but got to your voice mail so I am sending you this email to clarify some questions I have.  Please confirm that when you mention the ""processing of the ECI payments"" you refer to the actual wire transfers and not to the process of confirming the amounts based on the ECI-Enron contracts - which I hope is complete by now.  Also, when you refer to the ECI payments does that mean that the Employment Agreement payment amounts are still under review? If that is the case and in the interest of gaining time please proceed with the payments of the ECI amounts which I take it are simpler to calculate (they depend on a formula and not on net income calculations like the Employment Agreement payments) and we can deal with the Employment Agreement payments later. Obviously if you have performed all the calculations for both payments I would prefer to receive the entire amount.  I realize this is a hectic time at Enron but unfortunately these payments are VERY late and as I described in my previous emails I have been postponing closing an important transaction which has considerable value to me for months now. Unless I receive at least the ECI related payments immediately I will be obliged to unwind other investments which may be done at a considerable cost to me.  Please let me know if you have all the necessary information for the wire transfers available to you.  I look forward to hearing from you.

I am writing to let you know that the processing of your ECI payments has begun!  Because of the significant amount of activity here at Enron over the past few days, it may take a few days to finalize the processing.

Miller   Dear  Michelle:       I  just finished my conference call with Liz Miller (counsel for Calpine),  Christina Solomon, and Steve Schuler (Steve is co-counsel for Miller with  Christina).  Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at  the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary  concerns.  She made the following points:                    (1)    She has talked with several different people at various  levels of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats  the power grids as ""completely different"" regions, strategies for which are not  shared internally among those regions.                (2)    She asserts that ""how we do it at Calpine is totally  different from Enron,"" since Calpine is ""trading around a portfolio of assets  that we own.""  She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets,  trades differently.  When I replied that Enron does have power generation  assets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is  vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power  generation assets.            (3)    Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in  ""Urcot"" (sp??) in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.   According to Liz, Calpine's strategies concerning these specific regions is  divorced from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the  East or West.              (4)    Liz is of the opinion that Miller ""is not senior enough  that we would be looking for what he knows.""  He has no role whatsoever in  discussing or formulating strategy for trading.  Miller, she insists, is on  the receiving end only.  He takes orders, dispatching and scheduling  solely in response to orders he receives from others.            (5)    Liz acknowledges that, were Miller in a more senior,  responsible position, she would have the same concerns we are expressing were  the tables turned.  Miller is ""so slotted,"" however, that she believes that  he is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess  (though she and Miller's attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any  critical information, that the most critical information changes on a day-to-day  basis).          We  ended the conversation with the following  understandings:           (1)    Liz  will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a non-trading function for a  period of two months or so.                      --She hastened to add, however, that trading is the only area for which  they really have any use for Miller.  She then suggested that she could  explore putting him instead in the West (""I know Enron doesn't even have a  western desk here."").  I believe that any proposal she comes back  with will entail his continuing in some trading  function.           (2)    Liz  will try to determine how Calpine might provide assurances (acceptable to  ENA) that Miller is ""on the receiving end only,"" as she asserts, such that we  would be confident that he is indeed not in a position to use any trade  secrets he may remember.                      --On this point, I was clear that I did not know either what level of assurance  ENA would require or whether this would even be a feasible  alternative.                (3)    I am to explore with ENA whether this additional  information about Calpine's difference in trading strategy and the limitations  on Miller's duties alleviates ENA's concerns about protection of its trade  secrets.                    --Liz seems to believe that if the business people really knew the information  she is giving to me, they would not be concerned about the activities of this  low level person.

Michelle, since the Plan is not administered centrally, it can be a challenge to learn what past practices were, especially if they differed from different work groups.  I've have always recommended centralized administration because an ERISA plan is required to be administered uniformly and consistently in similar circumstances.    One place to check about past practices is Cynthia Barrow's group.  You may not know what all past practices were until the conclusion of discovery related to litigation.    I don't know what past practices were, but I would start with Cynthia's group which I view as the source and reference point as to what the recommended practices should be.

Here's something for discussion purposes only: Per the Enron analyst call, we've established which businesses are core to Enron and will move with the merger, as well as those businesses that are no longer core. To that end, we will quickly begin to restructure the company by downsizing non-core businesses and non-essential functions in an effort to immediately reduce operating expenses. The timing is unknown, but is expected in the next two to three weeks. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE REVISED SEVERANCE PACKAGE No one could have anticipated the convergence of events that have brought us to this point.  While many are saddened by the merger, we must acknowledge that this was by far the best alternative for Enron and its employees. All employees, including managment, are experiencing some degree of grief and disbelief.  Please continue to maintain your professionalism and treat your coworkers with respect during this difficult time.  This is a rough outline.  I'd enhance whatever we provide HODs.  Keep in mind too, that any new messaging is going to invite a whole new series of questions.  Some initial questions might be 1.) will the revised severance be set until the merger (could it be reduced again for a later round of layoffs), and 2.) will service be bridged if you are layed off by Enron but hired on by Dynegy after the merger.      -----Original Message----- From:  O'rourke, Tim   Sent: Thursday, November 15, 2001 11:41 AM To: Oxley, David; Gilchrist, Scott; Denne, Karen; James, Terrie; Palmer, Mark A.

In very short order, we will need detailed payment data so that we can begin setting up the first payments up for distribution on January 4, 2001.  Should these be W-2 distributions (wages), we will also need to know the Employer FICA amounts.

It appears that our offer letters refer to the bonus as a ""sign-on bonus"" and ""signing bonus"" and state that it will be paid within 30 days of hire.  The letter does not address what to do if we revoke, or if the applicant revokes.     I think that based on the ""signing"" language, applicants could argue that because they signed, we owe signing bonuses.    On the other hand, signing alone really can't be enough to justify payment; I don't think anyone would buy off on the idea that an applicant could sign, refuse to show up, and still be owed the bonus.    Balancing those considerations, I think a viable argument can be made that an applicant who signs and professes a willingness to still show up must be paid the promised signing bonus.  As such, I think we have some exposure here.  I can't assess how much, in part because I don't have an estimate of the dollars at issue.  I do, however, understand that we plan to revoke approximately 100 offers, not necessarily all of which will involve signing bonuses.

Ms. Davis would like to be reinstated to work at another NEPCO job site at the rate of pay at which she was employed while working at Jenks.  She would not, however, like to go to El Dorado, as she believes the people who mistreated her now are working there.  I told the investigator that I wasn't sure whether reinstatement was an option at all, given the reasons for her discharge.  I asked her what the alternative would be.  While she is obtaining that information, I told her that I would raise the reinstatement route with you.  Although Ms. Davis was terminated for undermining the brass-in, brass-out rule by leaving her station, the investigation revealed several mitigating circumstances for her actions.  One, the power was out completely.  She previously had indicated a fear of working on the site at night, but she had no flashlight or any way to reach anybody from the site.  Second, there is the contention that the security guard came by and told her to leave.  Third, this offense is not a terminable one under the NEPCO progressive discipline policy (although of course that policy provides for flexibility based on the circumstances).  Ben's investigation revealed some other reasons why he was concerned about how Ms. Davis had been treated; he can provide detail, if we want.    The bottom line is that I do not see this as a slam dunk situation, and I believe that some sort of resolution would be fruitful.  What that may look like remains an open question.

"I think this looks good.  For simplicity, I would use the ethnic codes we have in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones. That makes it easier to populate.  One other field to add would be visa status.     As with the other documents, I believe that the population of these documents can be done now, with just the blank for ""yes"" or ""no"" for layoff waiting for the rest of the process.  You probably will have to run these by the generalist, Valeria or someone in ER team, and the attorneys for the special risk factors column.

"David,  Late last week, I received a call from Kristen Kracraft, who does employment law at Dynegy.  She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.  In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?  I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.  Let me know your thoughts on this.

Using this revised design, every laid off employee, whether subject to WARN, would receive the same net amount of severance benefit, whether a WARN penalty had to be paid by the employer, whether a WARN notice was given in advance of layoff, or whether WARN did not apply to the lay off in any way.

She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.  In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?  I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.  Let me know your thoughts on this.

"While you were out, it was a bit crazed as you expected.  I'll hit some highlights for you:  Botchlett and Straub position statements: went out on Wednesday.  Chapman:  I sent the Ok. lawyer a letter and hired Lyn Mattson to investigate.    Roome:  Spoke with Trey (we had a case against each other a while back and get along well) and sent him a letter.  Left Haedicke a message asking if we should give anyone in particular a head's up that they mentioned the SEC investigation.  He says don't need to pass along.  Anthony Sexton:  Got out that separation agreement.   Ken Rice:  Sent Mark Haedicke a memo outlining the non-competition obligations and potential issues.  CC'd you on it.  Kitchen/Nettleton:  Further discussions with T&F, Oxley, Marcus, Tim Callaghan, etc.  Sounds like Marcus is happy.  We're getting packet for consular process out to T&F, they send to London, and we think that with some luck (depending on FBI delay on background check), January or February may hold their interviews.  Marcus decided not to switch to J&G.  RIF:  I helped out on some connected stuff, including helping Kerry with release language and speaking with counsel in Mexico so HR can determine what needs to go into calculations for analysis of shutdown of all Mexico ops.  Internet Use:  Prepared a memo for Oxley.  He hasn't responded about whether he wishes to use it.  He walked someone out the door (without talking to legal) for posting on the internet from work.

Luckily for the effort, I think all of these people, with the exception of Steven have a longer term position at broadband or elsewhere at Enron.  If this group of people or some subset thereof remains at Enron then I think we can get good litigation services from them re: broadband claims.  Call me if you have any questions.

A&B employees will receive bonus consideration however the amount is not dependant or determined by their A / B designation.   Accordingly, any mention of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the past, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contributions over the past year.   As result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, should not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aaron Brown)  2. The employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculated to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific term date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance pay, without a severance plan offset.

The insurance company may not pay the benefit regardless of what Enron wants to do.  If when the insurance company understands the circumstances, would be willing to pay a benefit to an employee on WARN leave of absence, then it would be a good idea to have the Welfare Benefits Plans Committee adopt a procedure for such insured plans that states employees on WARN leave of absence or furlough with pay are considered to be actively at work during such period that they are instructed not to come to their work location during such time.  As to Section 2.3(e) of the Plan, we could either delete that section and add a six month active employment eligibility period with no service bridge to Section 2.1, or revise (e) to state the same thing.

A&B employees will receive bonus consideration however the amount is not dependant or determined by their A / B designation.   Accordingly, any mention of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the past, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contributions over the past year.   As result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, should not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aaron Brown)  2. The employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculated to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific term date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance pay, without a severance plan offset.

"Michelle Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).  Sheri  When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?

Our proposed changes to the Trust are attached.  We have no changes to the appendices.  As we discussed earlier today, there are two other documents that we will require to establish the account: 1) Authorized Signers who can direct Wachovia as Trustee (form attached) and 2) evidence of authority to establish the trust (I have attached a very generic form that can be modified).  These forms will not be required to open the trust tomorrow, but are required documentation  On the issue of tax payments, Pam and I discussed W-2 wages vs. K-1 ordinary income, and you have indicated that these payments will be W-2 income.  As a follow-up item, we would like your counsel to write a letter to us confirming that this is the proper distribution method for this trust.  In very short order, we will need detailed payment data so that we can begin setting up the first payments up for distribution on January 4, 2001.  Should these be W-2 distributions (wages), we will also need to know the Employer FICA amounts.  Please also confirm the number of affiliates listed in Appendix C (3, I believe), and Participants/Payments in Appendix B so that I can finalize a fee quote by morning to include in Appendix D.  Please do not hesitate to call me at home this evening at (336) 712-9598 if you would like to discuss any of this.

Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:  ? Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.    ? After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.  ? Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will now be allowed, regardless of your age, from ALL company contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.    To move funds: On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu. On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."" This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.  To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://hewitt.resources.com/enron  or through benefits.enron.com.

"Michelle: Thanks for taking a look at this memo that Andre Sarasin of Papiers Stadacona would like to send out to his employees today. Please note that this will be issued in French, so this English translation is not perfect...but it least it gets the main message across. Please let me know what you think--both Peter and Cheryl have approved this.   Thanks, Jennifer x3-9964  The management of Papiers Stadacona met yesterday and this morning the union representatives as well as the staff personnel to answer their questions concerning Papiers Stadacona's situation and its owner's.  Mr. Sarasin repeated that the activities of Papers Stadacona are profitable and he has the conviction that it is in the interest of all parties concerned to continue the operations of Papers Stadacona and the Quebec Mill.  In several circumstances during the last quarter of century, the different owners of our company have had financial difficulties and, in every case, the Quebec Mill continued to operate for the simple reason that it is profitable. Mr. Sarasin believes that the present situation is no exception to the rule.  On the other hand, concerning questionings on the pension plan of employees, we are to be reminded that these funds are completely independent from the Company. Indeed, these are placed in trust with the Royal Trust and no creditor can have access to these funds.  The current situation can evolve quickly, but whatever is the result, our strategy is to fill our obligations, i.e. to make papers and board of quality, to control our costs and to continue to improve our productivity and the efficiency of our mill.

She was the admin with Joe Sutton's office who'd approached me and then insisted I had to come work with her in supporting Joe's office even after I had told HR and her I wasn't interested.  She was also responsible for eliminating me from Joe's office in his absence upon her return from her surgery after I had supported his office  having been complimented by him verbally to Pam in my presence as having taken what he referred to  as ""the best planned trip he'd been on in years with everything in place"". (This was in reference to his trip around the world when he went to India to meet with President Clinton.)  Pam said she's ""had me on her mind for a long time"" then proceeded with: ""I was going to call you at home but was uncertain that the number I had was correct, so decided to call you at Enron since I knew you were there.""  ""I had to call to tell you I've had you on my mind for a long time and that I need to tell you how very sorry I am for what I did to you, Cindy.  You didn't deserve to be treated like that.""  ""You are a fine person"" and then she broke down crying on the telephone.  Pam said she hoped in her heart I would forgive her and that ""she didn't deserve to talk to me"".    She said she had retired and was calling me from her home and that ""God had been talking to her and told her to make this telephone call and that she needed to call to apologize to me for what she had done to me."" She said twice, ""if there is anything I can do for you emotionally or financially, please call me and I will do whatever I can to help you.""  My only response to Pam was, ""Pam,  I  do not understood why you did it.""     Tim, in all of my years employed within the corporate environment, I have never encountered anyone like Pam Benson before who would harbor jealousy to the point where they would want to destroy a person's reputation among their peers and professional associates and manipulate someone's career.  Of course she caught me off guard calling me here at the office around 11:00 am which left me speechless.  I found her call strange as so much time has passed.  Her disruptive behavior only reflected her thoughts.   I just thought I'd share this with you.  Some people never cease to amaze me.

Robin deposited the check from Enron into my bank account last Thursday evening, December 13th.  On Friday, I mailed via FedEx my tax return with a check in the amount of $32,127.00.  The IRS received the check and my return on Monday, December 17.    Today I checked my account electronically and there was only $7,000 in the account.  I called Wells Fargo Bank because the amount did not balance with my records.  The Bank informed me that the Enron check is not credited in my account because the Enron check was not honored.  They don't show that the IRS has yet forwarded my tax check, but if it has not already been received and returned to the IRS IT WILL CERTAINLY HIT MY BANK TODAY.  Enron's bank notified my bank last night that the Enron check is being returned due to non-payment and that the maker of the check needs to be notified.  Enron's bank will not give further information as to the exact reason.  Please contact me immediately as to how Enron is planning to solve this problem.

"Mich,  I believe Anne Koehler led Greg to believe the estate couldn't hire from NETCO, but I thought you and I had discussed a clause that would allow the estate access to certain people they need who may be going with NETCO. May not be a non-solicitation clause but I'm sure it effectively allowed estate to get people back from NETCO if it needed them?  Can you confirm  David  -----Original Message----- From: Piper, Greg  Sent: Monday, December 31, 2001 8:27 AM To: Oxley, David Cc: Jones, Robert W.- HR Exec Subject: RE: employee issues between NetCo and Estate   I will let you and/or Robert work with Beth's group on this.  Jay's group and Jenny's group are probably OK with communication.  I think that if Beth's people and everyone else understand that although it will be a voluntary quit if they are on the NetCo list and do not accept a job with NetCo, their compensation will most likely be equal or better and they will be working for a going concern that is A rated.  Also, it seems that the NetCo people on Beth's list will be working for Webb assuming a deal gets done and they move over, so maybe you and Robert can work with Webb on this so that he can communicate with them as well if you think that is positive.  On the non-solicitation, if I was buying the trading company, I would like a one way non-solicitation where I could hire from the estate but they could not hire from me.  But practically speaking, I don't see why there needs to be one either way.  My logic is that in the first year, the estate would only hire back from NetCo an employee that was not liking it over there or who's job had become smaller, etc. and assuming the estate even had a job for them to do.  It just leaves the door open for a few people who may, within a year, want to move on and that the estate could use.  The estate will be a bankrupt entity with no trading so it is not like we can attract anyone who is happy and real valuable to NetCo. If there was not a non-solicitation either way, NetCo would also be free to hire from the estate a person they could attract.

It may not have been in talking points but I think I made it reasonably clear in all the discussions I have had. I can't see any purchaser concluding that the way to make money with NETCO is to cut costs and since Webb and Rub will run IT and Bob Hall back office, they will be deciding who does what.  As to the no hire from NETCO I will look into it, but as a practical matter I can't see why the estate would want to be hiring or that a purchaser would be in agreement.  Sounds like we need to sit them down and get them back on the right track. I have a suspicion that since Beth in particular was dead against communicating anything that this was not handled well in Networks. I am not hearing any issues elsewhere.

The talking points said nothing about a point in time when the option of going to the estate is closed and after that point not accepting a job with netco is a voluntary quit. Therefore I don't think people have that info. Also an attorney today said that the deal does not allow the estate to hire from netco for a year but that there is nothing about netco not hiring from the estate. Don't you think it should at least go both ways?  I am not the person deciding the above two issue  I am fine with a no option back to estate past a certain deadline but if that is the deal I think we should let them all know it.   Also the visa issue, I think, is not whether the new employer will accept them it is whether the new company makes them a bad offer and the option to go to the estate is closed andthey are forced to accept it or be on the street with the clock ticking on them to find a new job or leave the country  Greg Piper",michelle.cash@enron.com,david.oxley@enron.com,FW: employee issues between NetCo and Estate,2001-12-31 08:54:51-08:00,received

Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. = The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the=  unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally,=  people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the e= state which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to spons= or green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the fo= rm of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant. =20 I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as di= fficult as this may be. =20 The main points we need to communicate and build around would be; =20 Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at = least at current levels Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a p= erson as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typica= lly, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the curr= ent have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NE= TCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite th= e same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that=  is lost forever. Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enr= on's current arrangement, if we perform. Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of = cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. = This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a com= mitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to rep= ay it. Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each cas= e they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the sp= ecific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting per= iod but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take En= ron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their pl= an requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obvious= ly will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years=  in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contr= asted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is the= re a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on ne= gative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too=  much innuendo here. VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is a= pparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed l= ogistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these wil= l take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who hav= e VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will = not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the cou= nter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid travel= ing outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be=  legit. Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from s= cratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they wil= l support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enro= n estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officia= lly proclaimed. Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although e= ach counter-party has indicated a desire to ""normalise"" the terms with thos= e of their own company, over time. Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate pla= ns to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective bu= yer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working = assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, w= ill supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that indi= viduals may have had. Specifically, I expect that the new employer will not=  honor future equity, cash retention, target bonus or severance provisions = that may be in people contracts. Clearly, there may be some negotiation her= e. =20 Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary review= s, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out= , but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after al= l the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks = in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over=  the last 10 years. There may even be an ability to transfer (after a while=  to a different part of their organisation, if they have an internal postin= g process). =20 As to process from here, we want to identify those who DON""T want to go and=  why. I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an ""offer"" to switch and NOT accepti= ng it. As I mention above, many of the terms of the ""offer"" are unlikely to=  be a huge surprise, and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch t= hem out now for someone who does want to go. We should have 100% acceptance= , not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early wh= o had concerns, solving them or switching them out for someone else. =20 Jeanie/Amy/Michelle/Neil - looks like we need new updated talking points fo= r all.

If it's getting ""offered a lower paid job"" t= hat simply isn't in the plans of the NETCO transaction, unless Beth, Jay an= d Jenny are wanting to do that before the transaction (can't think why they=  would). Bottom-line, people will transfer to a SOLVENT, Aplus credit rated=  company, on the same salary on perform whatever job Jay and Jenny ask them=  to.
