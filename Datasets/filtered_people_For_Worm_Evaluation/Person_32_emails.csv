"I have reviewed the documents you forwarded to me and have the following  comments:  1.  Fuel Supply Agreement to be entered into between Glencore Ltd. and Enron  Fuels International, Inc. -    Page 15 - last sentence of 15.2 should read as follows:  ""The total cost of  such testing at the Unloading Point shall be shared equally by Seller and  Owner.""  2.  Fuel Supply Agreement to be entered into between Enron Fuels  International, Inc. and Empresa Energetica Corinto Ltd. -  Page 6 - first line of 7.1 (b) the number of days should be changed from  ""20"" to ""21"".  Page 15 - last sentence of 15.1 should read as follows:  ""Any costs of  testing at the loading port shall be borne by Seller's supplier.""  Page 15 - last sentence of 15.2 should read as follows:  ""The total cost of  such testing at the Unloading Point shall be shared equally by Buyer and  Seller's supplier.""  Page 21 - Insert the following sentence immediately prior to the last  sentence of 21.1:  ""In the event Seller's Affiliate withdraws from the Buyer  or the Project, (i) this Agreement shall immediately terminate and (ii) Buyer  (as purchaser thereunder) shall enter into a direct agreement with Seller's  supplier (as seller thereunder) on the same terms and conditions as this  Agreement, except Buyer shall provide such security as requested by Seller's  supplier.""  3.   Indemnification letter agreement - appears to be okay as reflected in  the redlined draft.  Please prepare on EI letterhead.  4.  Option Agreement - The purpose of this agreement is unclear.  The  agreements are assignable to affiliates; however, if a new fuel affiliate is  set up to take EFI out of the supply arrangements, EFI will not continue to  provide technical, accounting, management and other support without adequate  compensation, nor is EFI willing to give up its rights to transfer the  agreements to any other EFI affiliate.

"This is to confirm our conversation relating to the Option Agreement.  If EFI  is to sign, I believe that the following changes need to be made.  1.  The last sentence of paragraph No. 2 should be deleted.  The agreements  provide that EFI has the right to assign to an affiliate without EI's  consent.  EFI needs to maintain its right to so assign during the term of the  agreements.  2  Paragraph No. 3 needs to be modified by adding the words ""as reasonably""  before requested in the third line thereof; and deleting the word ""not"" in  the fifth line thereof.  Additionally, the last sentence needs to be deleted,  because the indemnity agreement needs to remain in effect for so long as EFI  is requested to perform any services under those agreements.

To: Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Bammel Gas Trust Assignment    Dan,   I think that given that there was a transfer of gas balances on the books  from HPLR to ECT on 2/1/99, we need to show the transfer of the Operative  Agreement rights and obligations to ECT first.  We can use the very same form  to effect a transfer of ECT's interest on to HPL  effective July 1, 1999,  with an acknowledgment of gas balances Schedule that will reflect the changes  in each parties balance on July 1, 1999.

"Barbara,  This relates to our meeting last Thursday when I asked Brenda if the Entex  Gas Marketing transactions stayed with Janet Wallis.  It is my understanding  that the Entex traders for both Entex and Entex Gas Marketing are sometimes  the same.  I recall times when Janet would request a deal under Entex and  then Entex would move the  transaction to Entex Gas Marketing.  They have  also gone the other way on some deals.    The same is possible with Southern Union Gas Company and Mercado in  Galveston and Port Arthur.    I raised the question because these may occur at or behind the city gate  delivery point. Brenda said that she was going to ask the business group how they wanted to  handle Entex Gas Marketing and Mercado.

Their questions/comments are summarized below.  TUFCO:  Tom has discussed with both Barbara and Steve that the desk (now  HPLC) will be ""trading"" with TUFCO on a monthly and daily basis.  He  understands that the term business needs to remain in ECT but that HPLC CAN  trade with TUFCO.  This needs to be confirmed. When reviewing the listing, all asked questions as to why certain  municipalities were not included in the ""prohibited"" listing.  I explained  our process of reviewing the counterparties, and how we noted the reason they  were excluded (ie, sales to City of Austin are for power generation only).   Can someone recap the counterparties reviewed as well as the logic for their  exclusion from the prohibited list?  I would like to review it with  Commercial. I assume that Melissa is addressing the Western Gas Resources, Inc - Texas  issue. I discussed with Tom his feelings on the ""marketing"" enntitiy agreements  remaining in ECT.  He believes it is more important to move as much of the  business to HPLC than any benefits derived from the contracts remaining in  ECT.  Therefore, we will assign those contracts with the marketing arms of  prohibited companies such as Entex Gas Marketing. I have talked with Joe Deffner regarding monetized contracts.  He is  discussing with Kristina Mordant of Legal who is researching the  documentation.  Initially they felt there were no large issues which would  interfere but reserved complete answers until the review is completed.  My  listing of monetized agreements include the following:  Brandywine,  DEI/Calpine, GSU/Entergy, Southern Union, TUFCO, Union Carbide and Entex. The transport agreements need to be reviewed.  Elsa Villarreal is out on  vacation beginning 5/28 until 6/14.  She is reviewing the listing today and  tommorrow, and is providing her advise as to terminations and new  agreements.  I will coordinate with Darren Farmer also.        Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

"Barbara,   I am not sure whether my response was sent or not yesterday.  My Notes Mail  crashed every time I tried to send an email.  The reason that I suggested  that Entex Gas Marketing and Mercado remain with their affiliated  distribution utility is that transactions with these entities are usually  behind the city gate, transactions usually bounce between the utility and the  marketing entity until a decision is made by the counterparty.  In the past  we have documented transactions as being with the marketing entity and Entex  has requested that they be with the utility, also the reverse has occurred.   However, if the utility will set up different marketing reps to keep the  business straight, then we should be okay with moving the marketing to HPL.

If so, it is possible to  manually change the confirm to fit the situation for the mean time.  Re 3.  I understand what Mary is saying, but in these cases that I'm  referring to (which I believe are rare), I believe the gas is flowing.  The  meter has been turned on and isn't the pipeline accepting the gas?  We are  still not nominating the gas, and because we have not put the ticket into the  system, we are withholding payment.  Now, from what I understand, client  services will make a manual payment, if they are called by the producer.   But, for 1 month or even 2 months, we have not made a payment, because client  services would not have known to make a payment, therefore, we are still in  violation.  It appears the best solution legally, would be not to turn on the  meter until the contract is signed.  I'm not sure that is a good business  decission though.  I know that there are cases where we don't know that the meter is still  flowing, or that it has been turned on.  I think the easiest thing would be  to make sure that we are covered with a GTC spot, taking out the language of  the recorded line.  Julie         Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

The traders on 35 are currently attempting to install a recorded line to  be used when negotiating.  2.  The difficulty with putting in a contract as unexecuted is that Unify  will not prevent the payment from going out the door.  I do not believe Unify  Settlements drafts based on contract status, it drafts on any Sitara deal  that replicated down, and Sitara reads unexecuted as a valid contract.    3.  We have posed the possibility of entering the contract as unexecuted and  enhancing Unify to hold payment as long as there was VP approval to hold  payment, but Mary Cook said that this process would be in violation of the  UCC based on the fact that we would partially perform (by accepting the gas  via the nom/scheduling process).  With this partial performance, withholding  the payment would not be appropriate under the law.    Please let me know your thoughts after reviewing my comments.  Thank you,  Melissa    Julie Meyers 08/27/99 03:36 PM To: Melissa Graves/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Kathryn Cordes/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: GTC'S AND CONFIRMS   While going through our confirmation process, there was some concern raised  on deals that we are not confirming.  I'm sure you are aware of the concern  that George W. had with not wanting a confirmation to go out to the producers  when they were trying to get a firm contract signed.  I spoke with Dan Hyvl  today and I wanted to relay to you his thoughts.  His first concern was if the Asset Traders were trading on a recorded phone  lines.  Apparently the GTC's specify that if there is a dispute with what is  on the confirmation, the recorded phone call would be the back up.  He said  that if these calls are not recorded, then we should not be using the GTC's.   In the case where the tickets are being held back until the contract is  signed (example: a ticket was submitted today to start back in June), then we  should be putting the contract in as unexecuted so the deal can be valued and  tracked.  His decision on that issue was based on my memory that if a  contract is marked unexecuted, Unify would not make payment.  If that is not  the case, we could still put the contract and deal in the systems, and have a  VP signed off that payment would not go out the door.  If deals are being done on an unrecorded phone line, Dan said that we would  need to do something different if the payment is to go out the door.  Like  for example, have the producer sign a one month contract.  Which I'm not sure  you would want to do that.  Otherwise, he said that the trades should be sent  down to 31 so they will be recorded.  I hope this makes sense.  Please call me, and let me know your thoughts.

"A Sixth Grade student has a penis so large, his parents warn him not to have  anything to do with girls.  They caution him he could easily kill someone.   Through the grapevine, his teacher learns about his unusual size, keeps him  after school and suggests they have sex.  He refuses expressing concern he  might kill her.   She laughs and scoffs at the idea and says she will elect  to be on top, in complete control, and nothing bad can happen.  He  reluctantly agrees but the teacher experiences such wonderful sensations, she  faints from pure joy.  Thinking he's killed her, the student runs from the  class room sobbing and crying, ""Oh my God!... I killed her!  I killed her!""   All at once he stops dead in his tracks, and a look of dawning comprehension  appears on his face as he says,... ""Wait just a minute!  I didn't kill her.

The more substantive revisions are as follows: (A) Section 5.1 was revised to match Section 9.1 of the Gas Purchase Agreement, (B) in Exhibit A, the Fort Union In-Service Date was revised to reflect the fact that it has already occurred, (C) in Exhibit A, Section L.1(i)., the reference to third party, and the related text, was deleted; and (D) in Exhibit A, Sections M.2, N.9, and N.10 were added.

Mortage concerns:  B. Recitals:  we want to make clear that the term loan amount can be ""up to"" $750,000 as opposed to ""is"" $750,000.   1.1:   Mortgagors need to be defined as all working interest owners in the leases and not the royalty or overriding  royalty owners.  Also stipulate that ownership of the Wellhead Gas Gathering System (WHGGS) ownership is  identical to the leasehold working interest ownership.  Here again Quantum will need to sign on behalf of itself and as  agent for its program investors.  EOW will sign for itself.  The nonworking interest owners will also need to sign for  themselves.   1.2.b:  Again stipulate that RI and ORRI owners not subject to mortgage or that all leasehold working interest owners  are bound.   2.1:  Mortgagee would be the assignee in this provision.   We need clarification on the ramifications of the assignment  being absolute.   2.4:  No duty of Mortgagee to produce rents is too much control to give Mortgagee even in theory.   3.1:  Stipulate that lien affects only leasehold working interest owners.   5.5.1:  Again mortgagor needs to be well defined.   5.1.(b):  Enernet of Wyoming (EOW) has granted a mortgage to secure the operations bond required by the Wyoming  Office of State Lands and Investments in the amount of $10,000. This mortgage is a permitted exception hereto.  EOW has also file of record AAPL Model Form 610RS-1989 Recording Supplement to the JOA and Financing Statement  in the ordinary course of business.   5.4:  The loss threshhold should probably need to be increased in light of the funding amount involved.   7.3:  The personal liability language referenced in this provision appears inconsistent with the in rem nature of the  mortage and therefore out of place.

BancFirst guaranteed the $25,000 MT BLM bond, $25,000 of the $50,000 MT State bond and  the $10,000 WY State Lands bond.  BancFirst required EOW to execute two $25,000 promissory  notes to secure the banks guarantees.  Enernet, Inc., (50% owner/member of EOW)and its owners  guaranteed the promissory notes for the bank.   EOW can immediately move to have one if not both of these promissory notes cancelled in order  not to impede the mortgage transaction with Enron.  Alternatively, in the very near future,  EOW will transfer all of its operated properties in MT to the new operating entity currently  being formed by Quantum and US Energy.  When the new operating entity is in place, EOW will  immediatedly transfer operations on all existing properties to the new entity.  Once  operations are transfered EOW will request cancellation of all MT bonding, which, will be  appproved by the BLM and the MT State Board of Oil and Gas upon the successful transfer of  operations from EOW to the new entity.  With the MT bonds cancelled, BancFirst will release  the mortgage in question.   EOW owns 2.5% of the Bonepile lease.  This should not be an obstacle in this transaction.  If Enron makes it one, it can be taken out of the equation.  The Enron record check in progress should reveal that 97.5% of the Bonepile lease should be free and clear of liens and encumbrances but for the JOA recording supplements filed routinely by EOW and other operators.  I will await the next communication from Dan Bump or Dan Hyvl.  -----Original Message----- From: dbump@ect.enron.com [mailto:dbump@ect.enron.com] Sent: Wednesday, February 09, 2000 4:07 PM To: dkg@enernetok.com; Roobannon@phillipsmcfall.com Subject: Mortgage Agreement   Gentlemen:  Latest version of subject document attached for your review.

"Dan,  Per my earlier conversation here are the details.  The original contracts are 078-27105-302 (NGMS & Entex) and 058-27105-301  (HPLC Mktg & Entex) .  The NGMS contract in Section 8 allows 1 year to  recover volume changes and the HPLC Mktg contract in Section 8 allows 2 years  to recover volume changes.  Per our conversation today, the contract  provisions override the state law and Entex should not be invoiced the  additional volumes.  Janet, since we cannot rebill Entex do you still want us to reallocate and  then write off the dollar amounts. This would enable us to be in sync from a physical volume side.   Please let  me know.

I am not familiar  with it and if we do have a legal right that overrides the contract then we  should explore this option.  Also,  what is the standard operation procedure?  Are we reconciling the  entire system and re-invoicing everyone whether it is for or against the  pipeline?

This came about due to a project that Volume Management is working on for  Brenda Herrod in reconciling the 1996-1998 Unaccounted For.  In comparing the measurement volumes at the various meters that make up the  aggregate meter 2000, it was discovered that some of the measurement volumes  had changed.  The Entex analysis  has been done for 1998 and had one  adjustment for June 1998 of 14,660 additional invoiced to Entex.  The 1997  analysis was done within the last month and this is when the discrepancies  were found.  I have done a preliminary analysis for 1996 and the only  material volume appears to be in April 1996 of 8,296 additional volume  needing to be invoiced to Entex.  The 1996 will be completed by Mid March.   I sent Ami the 1997 analysis to ask her how she wanted to address the issue  of whether or not you wanted to go back to Entex.      The Statute of Limitations is 4 years, so both the 1996 and 1997 adjustments  would fall within this timeframe.  Please contact me if there are any other questions or issues.

NOTES:  True Oil will probably become an LLC sometime this year.  Does that change  anything?  In Article 3.2 - True would like to know why that should be in there if we  are not lending money to them and they do not owe us money.  Article 3.4 - I added this. They would like some language added that gives  them the right to put compression in at their expense and the purchase price  re-negotiated should this article come into play.  Article 5 Force Majeure - Why is force majeure here and in the definitions?  Can one or the other be deleted??  Article 7.3 - True would like to know why there are set-offs here if we owe  them.  Article 7.4 - Is this paragraph necessary? Supposedly, True has not seen this  paragraph in any other contract.  Article 7.5 - filing of the Notice of Gas Contract - Where would this be  filed and why?  General Provisions - Seller's Representative Matters - I assume that the  first sentence, ""authorized agent....."", takes care of the Committed Reserses  that True does not have 100% ownership to. In other words, they cannot commit  ownership that they do not have.  Exhibit F - I added this Exhibit. The very last sentence about pulsation.

Stated  differently, the issue is whether quantities of gas required by General  Service Customers in the Beaumont Division or the South Texas Division should  be considered part of the Basket.  Transaction No. 1 - Revision No. 1 under the ENFOLIO Agreement states that  the DCQ obligations apply  to ""Customer's Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast  Divisions.""  Therefore, although this Transaction identifies the Delivery  Point(s) as those appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, the intent was  to exclude Beaumont and South Texas.  In an earlier conversation today, Dan  Hyvl confirmed that the foregoing was the appropriate analysis of this  Transaction.  Based on this call, it would appear that, although Exhibit C to the 76  Agreement lists multiple Delivery Points, the intent was to limit the  Delivery Point to the Customer group referenced in the heading of the  applicable ENFOLIO Agreement.  Dan further stated that the boundary lines were redrawn at some time prior to  December 29, 1998 (the date of the Restructuring Agreement).  We have not  seen documentation evidencing these changes.  In addition, it was discovered  that the ""Texas Coast Division"" (referenced on Exhibit C, as amended) is  actually the ""Gulf Coast Division.""  Dan mentioned that it would be prudent  for all parties to outline definitive boundaries of divisions for future  clarification.  Finally, he stated he would meet with you personally to  discuss these issues with you further.  I hope you find this information useful.

"Dan, At bottom of page is first run at contract.  Middle is changes to bottom.   Top is summary.  Call if you have questions.  1)  50,000 a day firm @ Index  (.01) 2)    0-60,000  first of the month nomination must be received prior to the  end of bid week (3 business days prior to end of month).  Also priced @ Index (.01) 3) Swing:  First 20,000 mmbtu/d priced @ GD Mid +.04 two days after      From 20,001 - 50,000 mmbtu/d priced @ GD Mid+ .10 two days after 4)Buyback:  Any volumes flowing less than first of month nom will be bought back on a  daily basis @ Katy Mid two days after.  Gary,  1. Backup swing - I can live with a two-tiered pricing structure for no-notice backup swing service. Just for clarification the tiers and pricing would be as follows:  a) 0 - 20,000 MMBtu/d at Gas Daily, Houston Ship Channel, Midpoint, two days after flow plus $0.04/MMBtu and,  b) 20,001 - 50,000 MMBtu/d at Gas Daily, Houston Ship Channel, Midpoint, two days after flow plus $0.10/MMBtu.  2. Firm Gas - The flexibility of the firm gas delivery is for plant maintenance only. I can drop the maximum volume to 110,000 MMBtu/d but that's it. Given our current maintenance schedule, the expected demand and your nominated volume would be as follows:    Month   Deer Park Demand  HPL Nomination   July 2000  207,000 MMBtu/d  105,000 MMBtu/d   August  207,000   105,000   September  207,000   105,000   October  190,000    95,000   November  210,000   110,000   December  210,000   110,000   January 2001 145,000    70,000   February  165,000    80,000   March   213,000   110,000   April   108,000    50,000   May   108,000    50,000   June   213,000   110,000  If you do the math, the total HPL nomination volume is 33,485,000 MMBtu for a daily average take of 91,700 MMBtu/d. The uncertainty is that the maintenance schedule is dynamic and the above numbers are subject to revision. That's why we need the flexibility.  3. Curtailment/Interruption - My expectation is that this is a firm gas supply. If I need to curtail and/or interrupt, it would trigger the buyback option and would count against my annual average. However, if you curtail and/or interrupt the buyback option would not be trigged and my annual average would be adjusted accordingly.  4. Nominations - your definition of bidweek is perfectly acceptable. Can I make a nomination of 105,000 MMBtu/d today?  ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary W Lamphier/HOU/ECT on 06/27/2000  11:34 AM ---------------------------   ""Shankster JL (Luther)"" <JLShankster@equiva.com> on 06/13/2000 04:43:18 PM To: ""'Lamphier, Gary'"" <glamphi@enron.com> cc: ""Coute, Sonia"" <COUTES@MSXSOPC.SHELL.COM>, ""Harrison, Rusty""  <RH310655@MSXSOPC.SHELL.COM>, ""Kendrick, Katrina""  <KK077836@MSXSOPC.SHELL.COM>, ""King, Alan"" <AK078371@MSXSOPC.SHELL.COM>,  ""Martin, William"" <WM127461@MSXSOPC.SHELL.COM>, ""Moseley, Richard""  <RM308499@MSXSOPC.SHELL.COM>, ""Osterwisch, Glenn""  <GO164578@MSXSOPC.SHELL.COM>, ""Buller, Thomas"" <THBuller@equiva.com>,  ""Carter, John"" <JCCarter@equiva.com>, ""Ricks, Ruth"" <RARicks@equiva.com>  Subject: Revised Shell Deer Park Confirmation - HPL   Gary,  Based on previous conversations, here is a revised confirmation outlining the terms of the award for gas supply to Deer Park.

"DAN - I've made a few modifications to the above referenced agreement to  reflect volume changes and pricing changes associated with the GRE deal.  The  deal structure has been modified to reflect an increase in the DCQ, a  $0.05  demand charge per DCQ and the ability for GRE to decrease its DCQ monthly.    Could you please review the changes I made, as well as clarify that the  respective pricing reflects gas purchased ""day-ahead"", not intraday.   Intraday gas sells will be negotiated/ quoted on an ""as needed"" basis.    What does not appear to be addressed in any of the contracts to be executed  by ENA and GRE is the agency relationship that will exist whereby ENA will  handle nominations, scheduling, invoicing , etc... The intent of our overall  arrangement with GRE is to provide an agency relationship pursuant to the  June 1, 2000 TRANSACTION TERM SHEET.  Is this agency arrangement going to be  documented separately?  If so, please prepare a draft.  Otherwise, please  incorporate into the below agreement language consistent with the June 1st  Transaction Term Sheet under the section entitled ""OPERATIONS"".      OSCAR - I've modified the agreement to reflect IF-FOM at Ventura for the DCQ  and GDA-Common High for all volumes in excess of the DCQ.  Also, as you note  above, I'm instructing Dan to clarify that this is day ahead gas.  Carl, in  his June 23rd term sheet broke out the pricing mechanism to include a ""day  of"" price.  I don't think we should show a price for intraday gas in the  Winter.  It will be overly expensive and probably will never be utilized.   Also, Carl raises the issue of utilizing third parties when ENA cannot  service their account (blancing services, etc...)  Conceptually, I am  indifferent, but if they don't use us than we don't nominate or schedule.  chris x31666        Oscar Dalton 06/30/2000 02:45 PM To: Dan Hyvl cc: Chris Meyer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jason R Wiesepape/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject:   Dan,  Great River Energy signed the reimbursement agreement and the transport  agreements.

Here is my quickie response.  We will not sign a binding agreement with SOCO until we know that we have the  gas under acceptable documentation, as outlined below:  If we must deliver at Elba to satisfy a deal with SOCO, then acceptable doc's  means that (1) Enron LNG will have final doc's with El Paso, (2) ENA will  have a Master in place with Enron LNG, and (3) our TA with Enron LNG should  say that they are selling to ENA subject to ENA closing/signing a subsequent  deal with SOCO (so we can ""leg into"" SOCO.)  If we get alternate or secondary receipt point rights from SOCO, which means  that we do not have to deliver at Elba, but we we can deliver from Destin,  then contractually and physically it makes no difference if we are firm or  not at Elba with Enron LNG.  The only problem is that we ought to be careful  representing that we are selling Elba as primary supply source with secondary  Destin, if we really are not going to get Elba finished.  Any further questions, let me know.  -- David       Dan J Hyvl 07/20/2000 04:55 PM To: Phil DeMoes/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Jeffrey T Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Fairley/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Southern Confirmation Letters  Attached please find a red-line redraft of the Confirmation Letters.

I think we can resolve  all issues as set forth below and in the attached revised agreement. Please  call me right away if you disagree, as I am posting this to the OPIC website  and the circulating the agreement for execution.   I will send a revised  agreement to Glencore in order to correct Section 5.3.  Doug--to the extent the side letter you referred to for Section 13.1 will  amend the Fuel Supply Agreements (which I assume it will), we will need to  show it to our lenders--please send the side letter to me ASAP.

Following you will find our comments:  1.- Section 5.3, in the note after the formula instead of "" values used in  calculating the above formula shall be set at ""0"" "", I suggest to write ""  Shall be taken out of the formula"". This is because if you set those value at  ""0"" you will have a wrong result in the formula. The issue is take out the  correspondent factor.  Agreed.  I will change this.    2.- Section 7.2 letter (a), first line: it refers that PQPC may cancel or  reduce any PQPC's order prior to the Cancellation Date. The Cancellation Date  is not less than 21 days prior to the fist day of the scheduled delivery  period (1.3). But in section 7.1 letter (b)  reads that PQPC's order should  be issued no later than 21 days prior of the fist day of the scheduled  delivery period. Does it make sense?, I mean, the cancellation date could  coincide with the PQPC's order day. Is it possible to have a Cancellation  Date not less than 15 days?  This is okay as written.    3.- Section 9.3. in the fourth line starting in ""the sixth (6th.) day after  ....""  Why it is different of the latest version of FSA between EPOS and  Glencore. In the FSA EPOS-GLENCORE is clear that "" the sixth (6th) day of the  calendar month following the calendar month in which the NOR date falls"".  This make sense since the invoice price will be the monthly average of the  prices of the calendar month in which the NOR date falls.  Corrected.  4.- Section 9.3 in line 18, why it is deleted ""average of the""  and in the  FSA EPOS_Glencore it is active.  This was also deleted in the Glencore-EPOS  FSA (at Glencore's request)  5.- Section 10.3 is missing the latest modification that was done in the FSA  EPOS-Glencore. Also that correction needs to be rewrite: ""EPOS shall be  responsible for additional demurrage charges caused by EPOS failing to arrive  at the unloading point during the scheduled delivery period to the extend  such demurrage cost are a direct result of such failure"".  Corrected.  6.- In the middle of Section 12.1, after "" which meets the specifications set  forth herein""  is missing ""said quantity to be officially measured at the  shore tank's up-gauge"" like was included in the FSA EPOS-Glencore.   Corrected.    7.- In Section 13.1. As we discussed some weeks ago, it is necessarily to  include that in no event the laytime should be less than 24 hours. I remember  that Doug Leach already talked about it with Glencore and every body agreed.   Doug Leach advised me that this would be handled in a side letter that will  also apply to Corinto.   8.- In section 13.2, after ""Section 10.2"" should be included ""and 10.3"" like  it is in the FSA EPOS-Glencore.  Corrected  9.- In Clause XVIII, the telephone of PQPC is (502) 368-1793 and the  facsimile (502) 368-2555. These numbers should be included.  Corrected  10.- Section 21.7, instead of ""Glencore and EPOS"" should be ""EPOS and PQPC"".

"Yes. I believe that is correct. I will review the documents with regards to  true assignment to a third party beyond assigning to an affiliate. But the  transaction was structured to give Enron complete commercial flexibility with  regards to restructuring or renegotiating the contracts. The sale is a bit  more than a restructuring but the remedy is likely to be the same. Either  Enron will retire the outstanding amounts under the monetization or give an  indemnity for any losses associated with the transfer. The banks will likely  accept either. Could you give me an idea of when the actual sale (cash  changing hands) would likely take place. If we close with conditions  precedent that are not likely to be met before 2001, I am less concerned  about the negative funds flow issue of prepaying the financing. Regardless, I  would imagine the outstanding amount under those contracts is getting quite  small through five years of amortization. Thanks.

This is to confirm that the contracts which were  monetized as a part of CASH II, being the contracts with Union Carbide, Texas  Utilities Fuel Company and Southern Union Gas Company, and the two contracts  with Entex, a division of Noram Energy Corp. (now Reliant Energy Entex, a  division of Reliant Energy Resources Corp.) could, if necessary,  be assigned  to an Enron subsidiary and that subsidiary could be sold to a third party  without necessarily having to unwind the prior monetizations.  Please advise  if this is not correct?  I will notify you with the specific contract  information if these contracts are included in any sale to a non Enron entity.

As you are aware, Enron is currently in the process of amending a number of  guarantees with respect to various Engage Energy entities.  Under the  project, the   US$25 million guarantee provided to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries to  guarantee the obligations of Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage Energy  US  L.P. ,as provided by The Coastal Corp. (the ""Existing Guarantee""), is to be  replaced with a number of guarantees which are segmented by the Engage Energy  entities and the type of contract (i.e. physical v. financial).    As part of this project, Russell Diamond has provided Enron Canada Corp. with  revised credit terms for dealing with Engage Energy Canada, L.P. under which  Westcoast Gas Inc. is to provide a US$20million guarantee of the obligations  of Engage Energy Canada L.P. under the existing master physical gas  purchase/sale agreement between the Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron  Canada Corp. (the ""ECC Physical Master"") as well as the master physical gas  purchase/sale agreement between Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron North  America Corp. (the ""ENA Physical Master"").   Russell had allocated US$15  million of the replacement guarantee to the ECC Physical Master and  US$5million to the ENA Physical Master.  Due to other inadequacies in the ECC Physical Master, we have prepared an  ""Amended and Restated"" ECC Physical Master which includes a number of  significant terms in addition to referring to the replacement guarantee  (which we are quite eager to have Engage execute).  As a result, I have  prepared a draft of  replacement guarantee (to be received from Westcoast Gas  Inc.) to accompany the Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.  However, to  ensure that the replacement guarantee meets your requirements, I am looking  for your input.  Please find attached a copy of the draft replacement  guarantee as blacklined to indicate the changes which have been made to the  Enron Canada Corp. standard guarantee to incorporate the obligations owing to  Enron North America Corp.  As you will see, there are a few bullets for which  I require your assistance in completing (i.e. date the of ENA Physical Master  and the appropriate contact information for notices).

All three of the contracts aren't our favorites per our earlier  conversations/e-mails dating back to the beginning of round 2, duplication  clean-up. The largest problem; the 1991 contract that they are terminating  has the greatest Max. Daily Quantity (20,000/day) (this was the one we were  favoring out of the three). However, the combined daily quantity on all the  outstanding deals by far exceeds the MDQ. A schedule of the outstanding deals  on the 9/1/91 (96029223) is attached. If we have the new contract in hand, I  can enter the new contract & hopefully move these deals over (the ones for  which gas has not yet flowed) - - - - - - we can split & move any deals for  which gas is currently flowing - - - - - - - we will need the Confirm group  to reconfirm. This is assuming that we do indeed have the new agreement  executed by both parties.  Back to the letters, they want our signature to waive the 90 day notice. The  1990 contract have been on trading suspended status since 7/18/00 & has no  outstanding deals. So, if we are 'okay' with that - - - - - there are no  loose strings (if okay, do you want to sign?). However, on the 1991 contract  there are LOTS of loose ends - - - - - -- what is your recommendation?   Fun stuff eh?

I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs  to answer.  1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers  is 30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree? 2. Reliant claims that the ""New Technology Contract"" overrides  or is an exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception? 3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the  Houston Division is under ""special contracts"" with special pricing, and even though  they are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU. Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception? 4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are not a new customer, or a customer that has left. 5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite 100 Mcf.  These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.

We have reviewed the draft of the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sales Agreement and find it generally to be a good agreement.  The attached file contains an addendum with three changes that we would like to make to the contract.  The first item is merely a grammatical clarification. The second relates to the fact that we typically do not get the annual report out within 120 days.  This year, we got it out in about 180 days. The third item relates to a requirement that we must follow as a municipal corporation.  Although the purchase process has not yet been approved by executive management, we wanted to get the contractual issues resolved so that the agreement could be immediately put in place once the approval occurs. Please do not hesitate to contact me at (210)353-3725 if you have an questions about the addendum.   <<Enfolio Addendum.doc>>  Thank you,  Christian W.

"Clement,  Russell Diamond of the Enron Credit group would like Enron to issue to  Engage (now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P.) a blanket guarantee  covering obligations of ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management  Services, Inc. without necessarily tying those obligations to specific  contracts.  Do you have a form of guaranty that could be used for this.  I  think that the guaranty would still have a limit ($25MM)?.  Please advise. ----- Forwarded by Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT on 10/13/2000 11:41 AM -----   Dan J Hyvl  10/13/2000 11:35 AM       To: Russell Diamond/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc: Debra Perlingiere/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey T Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S  Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT    Subject: Re: Engage  Russell,  The below two documents are the credit worksheet and the contract  relationship documents which you provided.  The credit worksheet states that  the guaranty should cover ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management  Services, Inc. and additionally should cover the master energy agreement with  EPMI.  Do we have a date of execution or effective date for such master  energy agreement.  The contract relationship document merely states that the  guaranty should cover the new master firm purchase sale agreement  that ENA  is negotiating with Engage and an master energy agreement between EPMI and  ____.  No agreements of any type are specified for ECC or Clinton Energy  Management Services, Inc.  Also, are any of the Master Swap agreements that  ENA has with Engage to be covered by the requested guaranty?  I believe that  we need to get together at your convenience and determine exactly which  contracts Enron Corp. is to cover with the guaranty agreement being offered  as a part of the security for the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.   Please let me know when you will be available to discuss.

"Craig,  Attached please find a revised draft of the Ormet Contract.  I have  incorporated the language from the Credit Worksheet prepared by Jason  Williams.  That language is included in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the Contract  and in the definitions for Material Adverse Change, Guarantor, Funded Debt,  Current Ratio, and Net Worth.    Regarding Amy Baird's memo, I have made the requested changes in Article 3  of the Contract regarding changing ""Schedule"" and ""Scheduled"" to ""deliver""  and ""delivered"" and ""receive"" and ""received"".  I did not add the language  requested in (iii) because that language is already included in the  definition of ""Replacement Price Differential"".  I included the language she  requested under (iv) as (iii) in Section 3.2  I omitted the last sentence  relating to consequential damages of $1,000,000 per occurrence as we  discussed and left in the language in Section 8.3 which limits the  consequential damages to a maximum of $1,000,000 during the term of the  Agreement.  Likewise, I did not delete the language from Section 8.3  providing that the gas is being supplied solely on the express  representations and warranties provided in the Agreement and that all other  warranties are being waived.  I did delete the language relating to Texas law  and sentence starting with ""Therefore, the Parties agree that (i) three""  because we had agreed to delete the language from Section 4.1 which set forth  the method of determining a party's liquidated damages. I added a sentence at the end of Section 8.5 relating to trial before the  court with waiver of right to jury trial.  I deleted the language relating to  arbitration in Appendix 1.   As we discussed, I did not make the change to force majeure.  We need to  discuss this.  Our obligation should be limited to having firm transportation  on one of the pipelines with interruptible transportation on the other.  If  the firm transportation is interrupted because of force majeure, our  obligation should be limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to  cause the volumes to be delivered via the other pipeline if there was  available capacity on such other pipeline.

I suggest that ""Weekday"" means Monday  through Friday except for ""Holidays"".? ""Holidays"" means ""NERC-defined  holidays"" (this is consistent with what NYISO uses in its services tariff).?  ""Weekend day"" means Saturday and Sunday.  (2) In Part II, ""OTHER"" part 2., 8th line, the period after ""November 30,  2000"" and before ""Customer"" needs to be changed to a comma.? You already made  this correction in the December transaction document.  (3) In BDKW12off-peak, ""CONTRACT PRICE (PER MMBTU)"", the true-up still  doesn't work.? The reason that we suggested it be moved to a side letter is  that, when we sign a November deal, we may or may not also sign a December  deal.? If the December deal is not signed, there is no carryforward of  Enron's possible loss from the November deal.? If you change ""CONTRACT PRICE  (PER MMBTU)"" in BDKW12off-peak to get rid of the true-up language, the side  letter would basically say that Sithe will pay to Enron the ""lesser of (x)  the negative of the sum of the negative values, if any, determined under Part  (b) of Transaction Nos. BD...,etc. and (y) the sum of the positive values, if  any, determined under Part (b) of Transaction Nos. BD...,etc.""  (4) In BDKW12on-peak, we can just use ""weekday"" instead of ""weekday day"", to  be consistent with the other monthly transactions.? Also, in ""CONTRACT PRICE  (PER MMBTU)"", part A, ""24 hrs/day"" should be replaced with ""16 hrs/day"".? In  Part II, ""OTHER"" parts 1. and 2., change ""570 MW"" to ""____ MW"".

"Richard Sanders and I talked with Elizabeth (an attorney with AEP).  She was  not sure that their was a question that needed to be answered.  Richard  opined that the question may have related to the effect on HPL if it lost the  Taub lawsuit.  This suit relates to an alleged violation of the surface  rights agreement (Collateral Agreement) which was entered into with certain  surface owners after the Unit Agreement was signed.  Richard explained that  if HPL lost the suit, it would lose its rights to maintain a pipeline and  well facilities on the property subject to the lawsuit.  In that event HPL  would have to either locate its pipeline around the property or  use its  condemnation rights to acquire an easement across the property.  Because the  Collateral Agreement relates to surface rights, losing those rights would not  affect HPL's rights under the Unit Agreement and thus the Taubs would not  have the right to drill a well to produce the gas that HPL has in storage.

"Ed,  We have removed the specific examples of Force Majeure as not being needed  because the revised 11.2 defines force majeure as an event not anticipated as  of the date hereof, which is not within the reasonable control of the party  and which by the exercise of due diligence such party is unable to overcome  or obtain a commercially reasonable substitute performance thereof, all  without listing specific types of events which might be considered.   You are correct in presuming that force majeure cannot be claimed for  economic purposes which is the reason for the underlined clause in the  preceding sentence.  By example, assuming that more than one transporter  could be used to effectuate deliveries to a particular point, if the  transporter utilized by a party experienced an event of force majeure, the  Enron revision would require a party to continue performance by obtaining  transportation on another transporter, irrespective of the cost.

"Russell,  Please review the attached draft of the draft Enfolio Master Firm  Purchase/Sale Agreement which has been drafted based on Exxon's comments as  necessary changes before they will allow the Mobil plant to schedule gas  under the terms of the October 1, 1995 Agreement.  I have merely incorporated  the credit language that was used in the October 1, 1995 agreement into this  agreement and have attempted to make the other changes that Exxon was  requesting.  Question, is the parent company still Mobil Corp. for the  purposes of the MAC.  Do you still agree with the prior credit requirements  as provided in the October 1, 1995 agreement, and if not, please provide me  with your updated requirements as early as possible this morning so that I  can incorporate into the agreement prior to presenting it to them for further  negotiation later today.  Lee,  Please review the attached so that we can discuss which of their changes  have been made, which we did not make and the reasons therefor.

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales  tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these  sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to  Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond  to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC  Tariff Filing Report..  Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period  01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs  sales tariff for period after assignment.  (When did this get assigned to  HPL?)  Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery  period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under  the transport tariff for this transport imbalance. DAN  Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery  period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then  HPL needs to file a sales tariff. DAN  Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract  (Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on  Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx);  Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should  not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing. DAN  Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm. Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99 Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99 Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99 Accounting Summary Report of Manual Invoices recorded in the G/L for 01/99,  03/99, 04/99, 05/99, 06/99, 07/99, 09/99, 10/99, 11/99 and  12/99. Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect  activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This  information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect  activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.

"Stacy,  The Reliant Energy changes which Ellen Dailey sent to you in August appeared  in my chair this morning.  I had discussed the Enovate/Reliant changes with  Ellen yesterday and we resolved most of the language except for the items I  noted as being Credit Dept calls, which Russell has yet to respond to.  I  agreed to make similar changes to the ENA/Reliant contract to that agreed  upon in the Enovate/Reliant contract.  In reviewing the materials that Ellen  sent you as marked, it appears that we had resolved all of the items in the  ENA/Reliant markup except for the credit driven items.  Therefore, I will  create a red-line and send back to Ellen next week, if Russell responds to my  earlier emails and to this email.

"The original Unit Agreement was described as follows:  Unit Agreement covering the Bammel Gas Unit, Harris County, Texas, entered  into as of the 1st day of January, 1966 by Houston Natural Gas Production  Company, called Operator, and other subscribers, namely, H. M. Harrell, Sr.;  John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as  Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of  William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust;  Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred  Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et  ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris  Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm.    First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas  Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation  in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in  Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year.  The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage  covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres.  I do  not have copies of these 2 amendments.    At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production  Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to  Houston Pipe Line Company.  The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas  Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged  into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL  Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company.

I was up in Michigan and had a great time.   There are a couple issues still to be worked out on the contract.  Please let  me know and I will get an agreement drawn up.    1)  Baseload Volume -   Based on historicals your average is roughly 9,000  mmbtu/d with swing from 6,000 - 12,000  We can work this two ways: 1)  Use 9,000 per day as baseload with swings  priced @ a GD and undertakes bought back at a GD      2)  You can nominate some number between 6,000 and 12,000 prior to bid  week and this becomes your baseload        number.  With swings priced @ a GD  and undertakes bought back at a GD 2)  Gas Daily price -   Since this is no notice swing we use HSC GD mid less (.01) for all takes  over baseload quantity two days after flow.  If  you take less than baseload quantity we buy this back at Katy GD low two  days after flow.  The two day after price is used in order to line up volumes with cash  price.  I would find out on the day after flow of your excess take and then  pay the next  days price to meet your needs, hence two days after.  3)  Term would be one year out of August 2000 with evergreen clause  (automatically extends month ot month) with 30 day written notice of  cancellation during evergreen term  Give me your input.

My Dear Thanksgiving Dinner Guests,  Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  I'm telling you in advance, so don't act surprised.  Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've made a few small changes: Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries.  After a trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of  flaming lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.  Once inside, our guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with the swags of Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make.  Instead, I've gotten the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in colorful autumn leaves from the front yard.  The mud was their idea.  The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or crystal goblets.  If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone will get a fork.  Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.  Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I promised.  Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration hand-crafted from the finest construction paper.  The artist assures me it is a turkey.  We will be dining fashionably late.  The children will entertain you while you wait.  I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I  have made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims, and the turkey hotline.  Please remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming.  If the children should mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them.  They are lying. We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start of our feast.  In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method.  We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement.  When the smoke alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like.   In the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table.  In a separate room.  Next door.  Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers.  This will not be happening at our dinner.  For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.  I stress ""private"", meaning:  Do not, under any circumstances, enter the kitchen to laugh at me.  Do not  send small, unsuspecting children to check on my progress.  I have an electric knife.  The turkey is unarmed. It stands to reason that I will eventually win.  When I do, we will eat.  I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that ""passing the rolls"" is not a football play.  Nor is it a request to bean your sister in the head with warm tasty bread.  Oh, and one reminder for the adults:  For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its  lesser-known name:  Cheese Sauce.  If a young diner questions you regarding the origins or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance.  Before I forget, there is one last change.  Instead of offering a choice between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints.  You will still have a choice:  take it or leave it.   Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  She probably won't come next year either.    I am thankful.","bettye.langham@juno.com, dorismit@mciworld.com",dan.hyvl@enron.com,Happy Thanksgiving!,2000-11-17 04:28:00-08:00,sent

On the one hand, we want  to present  ourselves as a credible and reliable supplier of natural gas to  any US customers.  I believe these customers will be looking for force  majeure language that is standard in the industry, which should include force  majeure on the pipelines transporting the gas to their facilities, on the  production facilities, to the extent they are dedicated or are affected by  some large event (such as a hurricane or a major storm) in the region, and on  the LNG terminalling and storage facilities at Elba.    They will not, however, be looking for a non-standard force majeure clause  that deals with possible situations in foreign lands and waters, i.e. as  described, more or less, in our force majeure langauge in the El Paso  Merchant Energy agreement.  If we try to include that kind of protection, the  customer will see the supply as risky and uncertain, therefore less valuable,  in the first instance.    Our LNG strategy is focused on establishing a merchant activity, which  requires both supply and market aggregation.  Such an activity will give us  protection against individual force majeure events by its very nature (i.e.  through diversification).  The basic question, then, is when do we start  acting as if we are an bonafide LNG merchant?  We can mitigate for the need to build in unique force majeure safeguards in  several ways: lower relative price alternative, albeit interruptible, sources of natural gas supply alternative fuels selection of customers with alternative fuels or replacement production. business interruption insurance selling the gas to El Paso instead of directly to a customer.  However, I believe this issue also needs to be addressed in the context of  our probable need to ""lock-in"" our pricing through the use of financial  instruments.  What's more, our customer may elect to do the same, quite  independent of us.  As I understand it, there is very limited force majeure  protection available to either of us in this regard.  I know you are working on the force majeure provisions of the draft  Definitive Agreement with El Paso, so I believe it is opportune at the  present time to extend this assessment to address the issues set forth above  (and others?).  When can we discuss?  Regards. Les     ",dan.hyvl@enron.com,phil.demoes@enron.com,SALES OF LNG - Force Majeure,2000-11-20 00:03:00-08:00,received

""If Enron Americas nominates gas for transportation on the SNG pipeline  system, (i) Enron Americas or an affiliate thereof must have subscribed  (directly from SNG) to firm transportation on the SNG system for a term not  less than the lesser of ten (10) years or the then-remaining term of the  Agreement, (ii) the Elba Island Facility must be, and remain during the  duration of such firm transportation, the primary receipt point for such firm  transportation, and (iii) such firm transportation (in MMBtu per day) shall  be for a quantity equal to the quantity of gas (in MMBtu per day) nominated  in the Redelivery Notice to be redelivered to Enron Americas on the SNG  system ((i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the ""Firm Transportation  Requirement"").""   After you have had a chance to evaluate these provisions, I would like to  discuss the matter with you.  Regards.

"Kim,  I have reviewed your markup of the redlined contract I forwarded to you last  Wednesday.  Since you confirmed that we were merely putting into place a  three month contract, we should be able to resolve the issues rather  quickly.  If we were working on the Master, I would agree that we are a long  way apart.  Let me respond to the changes you put in your last redline.   1. Delete the definition of ""Credit Support Provider"".  2. Add definition as follows:  The term ""Guarantor"" means, as to Seller,  Seller's ultimate parent, Enron Corp.  3. Restore the definition of Material Adverse Change to the language as  provided in my redline to you.  It is the position of our Credit Department  that a rating of BBB- is considered investment grade and as such that is the  benchmark below which a material adverse change would be triggered.  Enron  Corp. is currently rates as BBB.  4. The changes that you made in 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.2.1 are okay.  The  change that was made to 2.2.2. should be deleted.  5. The change that was made to 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 is okay.   6. The changes that were made in 9.1 should be removed because the sale and  purchase quantity is based on the DCQ.   Note that all settlements under the  Contract are based on the DCQ and any variations between actual and DCQ is to  be handled between the party and its transporter.   7. The change in 9.3 should be changed back to five (5) Days instead of 10  Days.  5 days is the equivalent of 60 days deliveries, changing to 10 would  mean 65 delivery days have elapsed before the Seller can notify Buyer of a  payment default.  8. The change in 10.2 of ""at or"" should be restored.  This is a 3 month  deal.  Seller's position is that Buyer is responsible for any taxes at or  after delivery.  Future Taxes are not applicable to a 3 month deal.  9. All of the changes made to 12.2, 12.3 and 12.5 should be removed.  There  is no partial force majeure, a party is either unable to perform because of  the event or the party can perform.  Please explain how the loss of Buyer's  market could be due to an event of Force Majeure and why the Buyer should not  be required to find a new market during such period.  Force Majeure should  only allow termination if the period extends for more than 180 Days and then  it should only be a triggering event allowing the other party to terminate  and collect a Termination Payment.  10.   The change in 14 should be deleted.  There is no event which would  allow early termination other than a Triggering Event.    11. Please explain the changes in 16.4.  Seller has provided all of the  notice address information that will be put in the Contract.  No telephone  number or other address will be added.  12. All of the changes made to 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 and 17.4 should be deleted  and the original language provided in my previous redline should be  restored.  These are requirements set forth by Enron's credit requirement and  are not subject to negotiation by me.    13. I have no problem with the changes proposed for 18.1, 18.2, 18.3 nor the  addition of 18.4; however, I do not believe that either party would be able  to locate qualified arbitrators who would agree to the shortened periods.   Please reconsider.  14. The changes made to the guaranty document appear to be acceptable and I  would forward same to Enron Corp. for their consideration.   Please review the Contract in light of the matters raised above and let me  have your comments so that we can get this finalized as soon as possible.

It includes all the changes requested by Dan Hyvl.  It has been edited with my counter (i.e. - striking what not acceptable/relevant and providing underlined substitute).  One thing I'd like you to consider in your review is the term and scope of this contract.  The contract is for 12/00 - 2/01, 3 months, only. Furthermore, the contract language covers just this transaction - it is NOT the base document for future transactions.  I will begin work with Enron early next year on a Master Contract to cover all future transactions.  With that in mind, I'd like to suggest that we remove any reference to a Material Adverse Change.  It is currently a new and unsettling concept to WPS, particularly their Credit Dept.  Given that (1) the contract is short duration and (2) it is extremely unlikely that WPS will fall even to a BBB ratings within this time period, I feel removal of this language would greatly improve the chances of getting a meaningful contract in place quickly (note today is the effective date).  I will work with WPS on this concept for the future Master Contract.  I am leaving for lunch but will be back shortly.  Thanks for your help with this.  Gas Supply Consulting, Inc.

Enron signed a binding Letter Agreement (which included a fairly  comprehensive Term Sheet) with Merchant on October 13, 1999.  A copy of this  agreement is attached hereto.     It was anticipated that the parties would execute a ""Definitive Agreement"",  which would replace the Letter Agreement and contain a number of other terms  and conditions to be mutually agreed upon.  As a precaution, the Letter  Agreement did outline a process to bring closure to this matter in case the  parties could not agree.  The parties did work together for several months on negotiating an ""LNG Sale  and Purchase Agreement"", which added a considerable number of important  provisions and modified a number of terms and conditions contained in the  Letter Agreement for the benefit of both parties.  However, the Quality  Letter Agreement, which is an attachment to the Letter Agreement, has become  a major source of contention for two primary reasons: despite the fact that the parties did not intend to modify the Quality Letter  Agreement, it is apparent to Enron, and indeed to Merchant, that this  agreement does not position the Terminal with the capability of handling LNG  from any meaningful number of LNG production sources in the world. Southern LNG, which is a party to the Quality Letter Agreement, has no  intention of agreeing to meaningfully modify its Terminal, although something  could be worked out if Enron were to eliminate a considerable portion of its  flexibility and optionality in its sales arrangement with Merchant, an  affiliate of Southern LNG.  I am attaching a copy of the LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement, as it was last  drafted in early July this year.  This draft does represent some considerable  movement from the Letter Agreement, but we found it to be acceptable with the  assumption that the quality issue would be favorably resolved.  This copy is  in the comparewrite format, but I think you will be able to work your way  through it for your purposes.     When it recently became apparent that w would not be able to close with  Merchant in terms acceptable to use, we decided we had better move back to  the Term Sheet intent, even though both parties will realize some  unattractive returns.  We have now drafted up the ""Definitive LNG Sale and  Purchase Agreement', which we believe captures the full intent of the Letter  Agreement and Term Sheet.  It is attached below for your review.     Following your review of the pertinent aspects of these last two documents,  we would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how, from a  pricing point of view, they might be better restructured.

"Kim,  I am reviewing the changes you made to see if they conform to our  discussion.  I understand from your comments in the email that you disagree  with the items we discussed and are attempting to go back to the previous  language which I indicated would be unacceptable.  As such, I have gone back  over the redlined contract and have only commented on the things that differ  from our previous agreement.  Please review these and call me in the morning  if you feel that your client cannot agree to these changes.   1. The sentence added at the end of 9.1 should be deleted.  Any differences  between the DCQ and actual is to be handled between the party and its  transporter.  As I explained, if we schedule a DCQ of 10,000 with you and the  pipeline and only deliver 9,500 to the pipeline, the pipeline will deliver  10,000 to you and collect the 500 shortfall from us.  Likewise, if we  schedule 10,000 with you and the pipeline and you only take 9,500, we still  sell you the 10,000 and the 500 you didn't take is between you and your  pipeline transporter. 2. 10.3 and 10.4 need to be deleted.  What we agree to say was as follows:   ""10.3  Buyer represents that no taxes are applicable at the Point of Sale.   In the event such representation is false, then such misrepresentation shall  be a Triggering Event allowing Seller to terminate the Contract pursuant to  Section 17.1."" 3. Delete the language ""not otherwise due to an event of force majeure"" that  you added in the 2nd and 8th lines of 12.3.   4. Delete the language added at the end of 12.5 and add language after the  word ""expired"" at the end of the second sentence.  ""In no event shall any  event of force majeure extend for a period in excess of 10 days during the  term of this Contract.  After such 10 day period, the parties shall be  obligated to resume performance as if the event of force majeure had been  remedied, and if such party does not resume performance, such nonperformance  shall be deemed a Triggering Event allowing the other party to terminate  pursuant to Section 17.1."" 5. Delete item (vii) added in 17.2 because it is adequately covered by my  inserted language in 12.5. 6. The $15,000,000 changed in the 3rd line of 17.4 needs to be changed back  to $10,000,000.  If the exposure exceeds $10,000,000, that is the reason  additional security would be required.  This contract contemplates that  Seller has to provide security for any exposure in excess of $0 whereas the  Buyer only has to provide security for exposure in excess of $10,000,000.   Not a very balanced obligation because the Seller is bearing all risk of  payment after it makes deliveries under the contract.      ""Kim Decell"" <kdecell@gassupplyconsulting.com>  12/07/2000 11:51 AM        To: <Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com>    cc:     Subject: Wisconsin Public Service contract     Dan,  Attached is a redline document which compares our current version to your 11/22 version.  I have summarized our differences below, but I will call you at about 10:30, subject to your calendar, to discuss the items.  Significant Differences (1) Taxes  I deleted Enron reference to Buyer paying taxes AT the Point of Sale.  I (a) kept our 10.3 but added sentence that ""no taxes currently applicable at POS and (b) added Sec 10.4, which we discussed gives either Party right to terminate contract if they are assessed an unduly burdensome tax.  (2) Exceptions to Force Majeure  I added ""not otherwise due to an event of force majeure"" to the section addressing failure of reserves/insufficient production from reserves.  This should clarify that if a force majeure event, ie explosion, occurred at Seller's supply point, Seller would NOT be obligated to perform (except as identified in Triggering Events).  (3) Billing  We cannot accept Enron's requested changes.  It is the industry-standard to bill Buyer's based on what WAS, not what was TO BE, delivered.  If actuals are not available, it is acceptable to bill based on DCQ, but once actuals are available, prior period adjustments would be made to the next invoice.  To demand a procedure different than the accepted industry-standard is something that should have been stipulated by Enron at the time the Contract Terms were established in 8/00.  Given the tremendous progress we've made to this point, I am hopeful that Enron will accept the industry-standard (billing on actuals) for this contract.  We can address this issue next month when we begin preparation of the future Enron/WPS Master Contract.  (4) Credit Terms  Based on our 12/6 discussion, I (a) removed Enron's Material Adverse Change definition, (b) removed Enron's Sec 17.2(vii) regarded MAC and (c) added back our Section 16.10 Credit Terms, whereby either Party has the right to demand credit support if in their sole and non-discriminatory assessment the other Party might not be able to meet its financial obligations pursuant to the Contract.  Failure to provide credit support is considered a Triggering Event per Enron's language.  (5) Effect of Force Majeure  Based on our 12/6 discussion, I (a) removed language referring to consequences of extended force majeure but revised to refer to Sec 17.2 Triggering Events and (b) added Sec 17.2 (vii) to make extended FM a Triggering Event.  (6) Collateral Requirement  THIS IS A NEW REQUEST.  I would like to change the Termination Payment threshold from $10MM to $15MM.  In light of soaring gas prices, WPS could find itself owing more than $10MM strictly based on standard, full-performance Accounts Receivable (for example:  15,000 (MDQ) * $10 (gas price) * 60 (days) = $9MM.)  I believe your provision was intended to keep Buyer's from having multi-month A/R and/or non-performance charges.  Since I believe we agree WPS is fully capable of meeting its financial obligations, we should not set a threshold below potential standard, full-performance A/R.   MINOR ITEMS (1) Throughout document, I made changes to your comments to make consistent with form of entire document, including changing Daily Contract Quantity to DCQ and putting days in words (ie 20 days became twenty (20) days). (2) Deleted Nominated Quantity definition as this term was replaced by DCQ. (3) Other changes that we agreed to yesterday.  Dan, please let me know the earliest, convenient time for you to discuss these items with me on the phone.  Thanks for your help.  Kim    Gas Supply Consulting, Inc.

"  Thank you for your e-mail with the draft of the amendment to the fuel  supply agreement.  I disagree that the amendment has nothing to do with the  1996 letter.  It is correct that the 1996 letter was superseded by the  amended and restated fuel supply but the situation created by the 1996 letter  was not contemplated in the amended and restated fuel supply.  The lenders  were not given a copy of the 1996 letter until recently and naturally asked  to be in the same position created by the 1996 letter which was not  contemplated in the amended and restated fuel supply.  Notwithstanding the  lenders strong case, I am still trying to argue this and many other issues  and there is a slight possibility we may be able to convince the lenders they  do not need this document.    We will continue to do our best to protect Enron's interests (at all levels)  in this highly complex and difficult financing.  As always, constructive  criticism and suggestions to improve our work are very much appreciated.  I will keep you informed of further developments  Thank you  FPL      Dan J Hyvl@ECT 12/07/2000 05:28 PM To: Doug Leach/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Ermes Melinchon/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Francisco Pinto  Leite/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Michael A Robison/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Amendment to Fuel Supply    Attached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist  PQPC.

"Jeff,  I had informed them that I was out Monday, however they scheduled the  meeting anyway.  I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal.   She wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete  it in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be taken  out of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the  meeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did  not deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they use  the enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of  paying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future  undefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge that  was being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of  default.    If they need someone from gas trading, can you attend Monday.  I am going to  leave Teresa a message requesting that she try to get Scott Neal or his  representative to attend and to let you know if your attendance was needed.   ----- Forwarded by Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT on 12/15/2000 03:32 PM -----   Amy Rios  12/15/2000 03:26 PM        To: Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric  Groves/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Moon/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Griffith/Corp/Enron@Enron,  Joan Quick/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jesus Melendrez/Corp/Enron@Enron, Teresa G  Bushman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Cook/HOU/ECT@ECT    cc: Chantelle Villanueva/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joya Williams/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sheri L  Cromwell/HOU/ECT@ECT    Subject: VPP Meeting  A meeting regarding the Terms of Physical Offtake Agreement with the VPP  Facility has    been scheduled for Monday December 18th at 1:00-2:00 in EB2868.

Business Day is  a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are open  for business.

If the due date for any payment to be made under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day.""  There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent on the following Monday.

We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various  Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to  Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport  contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether  the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then,  is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are  considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered  to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?  I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the  correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be  if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas  into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I  would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the  Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough  leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?  Thanks for your help.    ",lauri.allen@enron.com,dan.hyvl@enron.com,Re: Texas General Land Office IT Transport,2000-12-19 04:08:00-08:00,sent

This draft agreement:  1.   has a term that lasts as long as the VPPs.  2.   contemplates written Confirmations only.  3.   provides a price adjustment mechanism for under-deliveries, but does not characterize under or over-deliveries as breaches that justify damages.  4.   does not give Brazos, as Seller, any special remedies if ERAC fails to take.  5.   provides for netting across all transactions on a single monthly payment date that matches the settlement date under the interest rate swaps.  6.   has a very limited ability for the Buyer to terminate upon default (and even this may be too much for the Banks).  7.   includes the limitation of damages provisions and arbitration provisions from the Enfolio Gas Contract.  8.   references the Conoco General Provisions.  9.   in general, recognizes that the party on the other side from ERAC is a partnership controlled by an Enron general partner.  If this draft agreement represents a good compromise, I suspose no one will be really happy with it.  In any event, this is my attempt to give the Banks what we said in the term sheet that we would provide and also give as much protection as possible to ERAC.  One issue is not covered in the attached draft, and that is what the Contract Price and the Index Price will be.  In order to fit well with the other components of the deal, the Contract Price needs to be the floating price that is swapped with ENA and the Index Price needs to be the spot market price that is named as the ""Index Price"" in each Production Payment Conveyance.  If the Index Price named in the two existing Conveyances is not satisfactory to ERAC, I suppose that the oil desk and the VPP origination group will need to settle up outside the boundaries of the deal documents to which the Banks are parties, because I believe the Banks will consider it a fatal flaw in the deal if the Adjustment Quantities of Oil provided under the Conveyances cannot be converted into the necessary amounts of sales proceeds under this Master Oil Sales Agreement.  Please let me know how you want to proceed from here with this document. We need to get it to the Banks as soon as possible, but we need to know first whether it is correct.

"Here is another incident stemming from the A-S 30 inch pipeline rupture of  December 4, 2000.  Although the facts are still being developed, this  customer was also being supplied off of the A-S line and when it went down,  HPL had to activate another pipeline to serve this customer from a different  source or direction.  This line may have had some liquids settled in the line  or other sediments which became dislodged and ultimately may have caused a  failure at Ameripol's boiler.  This resulted in a fire which they claim  caused equipment and product damages.  Liquids are not identified in the  quality specifications for the gas to be delivered to Ameripol, only not more  than 20 grains of sulfur or 7 pounds of water vapor. Additionally, the contract does contain a waiver of consequential damages.   Gary indicated to me that they told him that about $130,000 of the loss was a  result of lost sales due to the inability to produce product.

The gas currently being produced is rich, if we lose the  market the gas production will have to be processed.  Processing will cost  HPL a minimum of $250k.  Here's the kicker, need this ASAP becase the market  wants to pull the trigger by Friday.  Here are the questions by meter, (this is important because processing  options are different for every meter:  1. who are the supply contracts with 2. can HPL terminate the contract for gas quality or did we waive the quality  requirements 3. what is the status of each contract, when does it terminate, is it in  evergreen, what are the notification procedures 4. what is the price on each contract 5. what did the wells produce in the latest available month 6. last but not least, do the contracts let us charge the producer for costs  incurred to bring the production up to pipeline quality  4112 9650 6027 5189 6411  Jim, are these meters correct?

"Russell,  Regarding their first point, we should only guarantee amounts that are  covered by our contracts.  Non contract amounts should not be subject the the  guarantee, incoming or outgoing.    Remember that we need to keep the guaranty amounts specific as to each enron  entity.  This is because the part that pertains to Houston Pipe Line Company  will need to be deleted from the guaranty and a separate guaranty from HPL's  new parent will need to take its place.    Somehow we need them to accept buyin on the fact that the new guarantee will  not be effective until the old guaranty has been superceded, even if this  takes the action of their spun off entity.

We have the following important comments:   (1) The first page of the Guaranty refers to specific Contracts that will be  covered by the Guaranty and one identified Contract is the Enfolio Master  Firm Purchase/ Sale Agreement.? As you are aware, this Contract has not been  signed between Coastal Merchant Energy and Enron companies and will not  probably be signed (if and) until our pending merger is completed.? Therefore  we request that the Guaranty language be broadened to include all Obligations  of the Enron entities to CME (and not be Contract specific).  (2)The third page of the Guaranty discusses Maximum Limit (Section 2) and  sets specific numerical caps for each of the covered Enron entities.? We had  requested for a unified Cap earlier and once again request that a unified Cap  be set for all entities.?   (3)The fifth page of the Guaranty (Section 9), says that this Guaranty will  supersede the Old Guaranty that was issued jointly to Engage US and Engage  Canada.? As you are aware, we are not affiliated or connected with Engage  Canada and therefore cannot bind Engage Canada whatsoever in the proposed  Guaranty.? That was the rationale for our insert in that paragraph (""insofar  as it respects Contract Party"").? This was deleted in your revised redline.  We are anxious to complete this Guaranty as soon as possible.? We suggest, if  it is necessary, a conference call involving ourselves and our Counsel.  Please respond at your earliest convenience.

Section 6.3b --  20 days should be changed to 15 days in each location in  this section.  Section 6.4 ---  Needs a lot of explanation.  Why is it here?  Why would we  agree to such?

Article 11 - Default -  Need to add additional Triggering Events, Early  Termination, and Termination Damage provisions.

Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement   Dan:  I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the fact that we ""need"" ""financially firm"" language in all contracts.  When the Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his trading intentions and it was assumed that ""financially firm"" ""needed"" to be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants ""financially firm"" out and ""firm"" substituted.  The definition for ""firm"" that they want in the contract is the standard definition for ""firm"" that is in the GISB as follows:  ""Firm"" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.  I believe the only other place in the contract that ""Financially Firm"" appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line, would you please change that occurrence of ""Financially Firm"" to just ""firm""?  Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the first page, we can line through ""Financially"" and initial, and then just the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX ""1"" would have to be redone to replace ""Financially Firm"" with just ""Firm"".

"Linda,  I am looking for the follow-up assignment.  I remember having it prepared  and signed when the AEP people were looking at the contracts across the  street.  The reason it was assigned back to ENA was that it needed to reside  in ENA through July 1999.  Thereafter it could be assigned to HPL.  If I  don't find the copy, everything got scuffled in the move, I will reassign  effective as of August 1, 1999.  Is this acceptable?

I apologize for not getting back to you sooner, my attempt to track down information on Enron and an ammonia forward market has not as of yet yielded results (I will continue to investigate).  Pursuant to the decision to focus initially financial hedging, risk management strategies, and to understand Mississippi Chemical's risk appetite and hedging objectives,  I offer the following questions:  1.  Historically, what percentage of your natural gas consumption have you hedged?  Are your required to have a specific percentage of your exposure hedged, with hedge levels depending differing time horizons? 2.  What policies/procedures govern what you can and cannot do with respect to hedging instruments? 3.  What is Mississippi Chemical's position on transacting over-the-counter swaps and options?  Is their any policy which requires you to transact on the exchange? 4.  How far out on the curve can you hedge? 5.  What is the appropriate conversion factor to be used to calculate natural gas per ton of product produced (our estimate is 25 MMBtu/ton)? 6.  What Green Markets posting (or other postings) are your products tied to?  If your products are sold based on forward contracts, what is the normal term of such contracts?  If sold on spot, to what index(es) are they tied? 7.  What is your internal price forecast for the price of ammonia for the next year, 2 years, etc?  Hopefully I am not asking for anything too difficult to obtain.  I do realize we may need to get a confidentiality agreement in place to protect the transferral of sensitive information.

"These are general conceptual concepts that need to be addressed.  I have not  attempted to redraft the language, only to point out areas where we will need  to work on modifications to the Contract language.   1. Section 5.01 Provision needs to be changed so that Termination Payment is  first paid by Company to Customer and if not paid by Company after notice,  then the Customer would be entitled to make a draw under the Surety Bond.  2. Section 5.03   Provision needs to be changed to reflect that the initial  bond term shall be __5__ years.  At the end of the initial term, the Company  shall either replace the bond with a new bond for remaining  term of  prepayment, provide a letter of credit for the remaining amount of  prepayment, or provide a corporate guaranty.    3. Section 7.01 This provision should be okay under the Commodity Futures  Modernization Act of 2000 enacted as of December 14, 2000.  The Customer  needs to represent to the Company that the Customer is an ""eligible contract  participant"" under the Act.  4. Section 10.02 10.02.05 - Company has no control on the substance of the  opinion of counsel for the surety bond provider.   The substance of such  opinion should be as negotiated between the bond providers counsel and the  Customer.   10.02.06  Should Customers inablility to get funding be an out  for the Customer?   10.02.08  Likewise, should the Customer's inability to  complete any swap agreements be an out for the Customer?  5. Section 21.01 21.01.02  Company should get aleast 5 business days notice  of nonpayment before the Customer should be entitled to cause an Early  Termination Date.  21.01.03  As previously noted in 5.03, Company should have  the option to provide alternative surety - as referenced in the Term Sheet.   Contract and Term Sheet need to be made consistent.  6. Section 21.03 and 21.04   Provisions of the Contract need to be consistent  so that all obligations of the parties are netted before any payment is  made.  Also 21.03 should first provide for payment by the Company and if not  made, then by the surety or other security provider.  We shouldn't have to  pay the Termination Payment to the Customer and then invoice the Customer for  any Market Exposure Damages under section 21.06.  These should be netted or  aggregated in computing the Termination Payment.","mark.breese@enron.com, phil.demoes@enron.com",dan.hyvl@enron.com,PEAK Bid Meeting,2001-02-23 01:23:00-08:00,sent

I also think that Elizabeth would  let you know if there was an issue on a particular deal.    This deal did NOT have a contract attached; I checked the audit tab to see  when Elizabeth approved it (the comment will read ""added user tag"").  I just  realized that the time was actually 5:30 when she approved it (gee, I can't  subtract 12:00 from military time).  I apologize.  I'm still showing the deal without a contract attached.  Maybe we have a  Sitara issue if you've already attached a deal.  I know we sometimes to have  to open another version of deal manager to see a contract, but I've done that  already and still don't see a contract.  Let me know if you see the same  thing.  I'm sorry if I came across the wrong way - the trouble with email vs.  face-to-face communication.  I just wanted to make sure you knew about our  policy and was afraid someone had overlooked telling you during training.

I have never left any outstanding deals out that I know of.  I have  two scenarios, either it did not show up on my portfolio immediately after  being released ( this has happened; where Liz has called and a particulary  deal has not shown up yet. In that case, I closed and re-opened the  portfolio) or either there were several fwd's still sitting out in that  portfolio that had not been removed even though a contract was attached.

We usually don't get too  many deals coming in that late in the day, but please make sure to check your  portfolios throughout the day and before you leave.  Even though this deal  won't flow until 03/01/01, it is our policy to make sure that there are NO  outstanding deals without contracts attached when we leave the office every  day.  We will have exceptions, such as waiting on addition information or  requesting clarification on something, that are OK to leave unattached.  I  also know that Deal Capture does not always validate deals once we have  attached contracts, but our group has committed to clear all unattached  (non-problem) deals each day.  Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with that particular  deal.  I wasn't sure if you knew our group policy and I just wanted to make  sure we don't get nailed on it some day.

"Sandi,  As you know, I am out of the loop relating to the assignment issue.  I  believe that George Weismann needs to give us an updated list of contracts  that currently exist together with a list of contracts that need to be put in  place to match the ENA contracts that ENA now intends to keep, but HPL also  wants.  The assignment issue has gotten very complicated.  I think that ENA  wants us to enter into new contracts with the counterparties.  I do not think  that there are any ENA contracts which need to be assigned to HPL.  There are  certain contracts that need to be assigned to the new HPL marketing company,  these being the contracts with Entex, etc., after we decide how ENA also  wants to keep the right to do business with these entities.  We probably need  a meeting with George to get updated information on what needs to be done.

"A GISB can be used for deals longer than a month if they are fully  interruptible.  However, we would only use the GISB for firm business If they  limit their business to one month or less which would include a 31 day  month.   The $20MM credit line represents the mark-to-market exposure of all  business that ENA would be doing with the customer so that any deal that  would tend to exceed the aggregate credit line would need to be separately  supported with additional credit documentation, i.e., a letter of credit or a  increase in the coverage under a parent guarantee.

Your email raised some questions for us.  Specifically, we do not understand your statement that the GISB is an interruptible contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less.  The GISB form you mailed us is similar to GISB's which we have received from other companies.  All specifically state in the bottom disclaimer paragraph of the first page that ""This Contract is intended for Interruptible transactions or Firm transactions of one month or less and may not be suitable for Firm transactions of longer than one month.""  Further, in the interior of the GISB, on Exhibit A, there is a place to check whether one wants firm or interruptible.  The intent of this email is to clarify.  Our interpretation is that GISBs can be for firm (which is what we would want to do), and they would be for 31 day months as well as 30 day or less. Do you agree with this?  If our interpretation is correct, it is not clear why a Master Firm is needed.  Can you explain what the value add is to our doing business? [Perhaps it would be useful for a case where we wanted to cover our long term purchases for a combined cycle plant which we intended to operate every day of the year other than scheduled maintenance outages.]  Lastly, in our notes from our meeting, I wrote that Enron had offered an initial $20MM credit line for Oglethorpe. When doing physical contracts either under a GISB or your Master Firm, does this amount represent a Mark to Market limit or a nominal limit?  We have our people reviewing GISB, ISDA, and Master Firm as I write this. We look forward to your responses.  Larry Bergen -------------------------------------------------------------------- -----Original Message----- From: Phil.DeMoes@enron.com [mailto:Phil.DeMoes@enron.com] Sent: Friday, March 02, 2001 4:14 PM To: Bergen, Laurence Subject: Re: Physical Contracts    Hey Laurence,  Good meeting you and Larry yesterday.   I think we had some good discussion yesterday and it seems like we have some things we can work on together.  As far as the contracts, a couple of clarifications and an answer to your question below.  You should have received a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement via email and hard copy.  Additionally, you have already received  a GISB contract and a ISDA Agreement.  Here is a brief description of what each of them do:     GISB - Gas Industry Standards Board Agreement - this is an interruptible    contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less.  OPC would not be able    to lock forward NYMEX prices on this contract but can purchase short    term supplies.    ISDA - this contract is for financial positions only.  If you wanted to    enter into swaps or derivative based products, you can perform them    under this contract without ever having to take physcial delivery.    Master Firm - Under this contract, OPC will be purchasing firm gas    supply and will be able to lock forward values on the NYMEX.  Note that    this is a physcial contract which will require OPC to take delivery.    OPC will receive a bill from Enron around the 5th after the month of    delivery and will be required to pay no later than the 25th.  If the    25th is on a weekend or holdiay, then the invoice will be due on the    next business day.  OPC payment obligations are always after the month    of delivery no later than the 25th with no need for any payments    beforehand.  Note that under Triggering Event in Section 4.2, either    party may need to provide additional credit assurances in the event of a    material change which could cause a letter of credit to be issued.  Let me know if you did not receive the Master Firm Agreement or if you have any more questions.  Thanks.

"THE NEW NEWLYWEDGAME  submitted by MeanBabaJean  This couple had only been married for two weeks. The husband, although very  much in love, couldn't wait to go out into town and party with his old  buddies, so he says to his new wife, ""Honey, I'll be right back...""?  ""Where are you going Coochy Cooh...?"" asked the wife.?  ""I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face. I'm going to have a beer.""?  The wife says to him, ""You want a beer my love?"" Then she opens the door to  the refrigerator and shows him 25 different kinds of beer brands from 12  different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.?  The husband doesn't know what to do, and the only thing that he can think of  saying is, ""Yes, Honey Pie...but the bar you know...the frozen glass...""?  He didn't get to finish the sentence, when the wife interrupts him by  saying,""You want a frozen glass Puppy Face?"" She takes a mug out of the  freezer so frozen that she was getting chills holding it.?  The husband, looking a bit pale, says, ""Yes, Tootsie Roll, but at the bar  they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long  I'll be right back. I promise. OK?""?  ""You want hors d'oeuvres Pookie Pooh?"" She opens the oven and takes out 15  dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in a blanket,  mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.?

"Grant,  I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do  not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the  above document.  Let me go over your list of items:  1. I have deleted the word ""DRAFT"".  2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the  contract would be executed by the City.  3. I have changed the word ""may"" to ""shall"".  4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency  Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a  particular point.  I do not think their is an omission.  5. I have added the word ""reasonable"".  6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided,  if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement  and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the  issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination  Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be  necessary to attain closure.  7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be  required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's  obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend  the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was  pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was  otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.  8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a  holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article  3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default  extends for more than 5 days during any month.   9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate  rating applies to ENA.  10. I have changed ""a"" to ""the""  11. I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an event of  Force Majeure.  12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due  when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language  would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a  particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as written.  13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you  review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were  referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling it in  using language that had been provided by the City.  14. I added the word ""reasonable"".  15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP.  16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the  provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2%  over prime language.  17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs  to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment grade and I  understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.  ENA is not a rated entity and  that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating.  18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the  requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have  made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know  that before we execute the Contract.  19. I have added the word ""reasonable"".  20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should  have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract.    21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.  We can agree to  meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am willing  to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer.  22. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our  Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows  a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the  person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.  Therefore , we  object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.  We believe that  each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should  stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to  the terms and provisions of the Contract.     I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you  care to discuss any of these matters.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions about certain of its terms and conditions.  Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the exhibits.  1.  There is the word ""DRAFT"" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which should be deleted.  2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words ""1st of January, 2001.""  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.  3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined. Therefore, the City requests the word ""may"" should be changed to ""shall.""  4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default. How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?  5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to ""reasonable attorneys' fees"" yet line 15 refers to ""attorneys' fees.""  To be internally consistent, line 15 should say ""reasonable attorneys' fees.""  6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the City to exercise these rights.  7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.  8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change ""30 days"" to ""5 days.""  The City is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.  9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp. (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard? Please explain.  10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is ""a Company"" supposed to refer to ""the Company"" ?  11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the 60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.  12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We don't understand it.  13.  Appendix ""1"":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?  14.  Appendix ""1"", Claims, line 4:  Please add ""reasonable"" before ""attorneys' fees.   15.  Appendix ""1"", GAAP:  This should read: ""GAAP means generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Customer.""  16.  Appendix ""1"", Interest Rate:  Please delete ""two percent over"".  The City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime should not apply to it.  17.  Appendix ""1"", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also, what is ENA's bond rating?  Is ""BBB-"" an investment grade rating?  18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being deleted.  But the ""Representations and Warranties"" is nevertheless included in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an opinion.  We would like to delete ""and (vii) it is not ... Party.""  19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add ""reasonable"" before ""attorneys' fees.""  20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by ""to the extent it has a legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc.""  21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my opinion.  22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.  Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for response.  Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today until Wednesday, March 7.

"Michael,    Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents  for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find  2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the  clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3  below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have  been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document.   1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always  be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less  than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company.    I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited  for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of  examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that  Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and  Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that  event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from  Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the  price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in  3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's  total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual  purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ  would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price  in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3).   2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should  Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties  are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas  requirements, then no buyback would be applicable.   3.

I am faxing a copy of the  presentation and relevant documents to each of you.  I think that this is a  deal that we are interested in looking at.  John and Jim, I think the only question we will have for you immediately are  the bankruptcy implications associated with the advance payments.  PG&E  claims there are none (of course).  Dan, since you reviewed the original PG&E (Core) Master Agreement, can you  review the proposed amendments to that Master?      Mark -- I don't think Enron Canada is a party to the PGE Master.  Can you  take a look at the form ENA executed and see if there is any reason why Enron  Canada couldn't execute the same form?  Note that PG&E also wants to be re-established to trade on EnronOnline.  I  understand the only impediment to that is that the masters need to be amended  to provide that Enron, not PG&E, is the confirming party, and that we were on  our way to documenting those amendments when this all blew up a few months  ago.  Dan, can you resurrect those amendments so we can see if we can weave  them into these amendments?

"Texas City Facility -  The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be  strained.  Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron  and Dominion Resources in early 1998.  Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,000  MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in  place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to  that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply  under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the  facility.  After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were  terminated.  At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility  although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the  Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in  place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity  obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in  volumes.  Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has  shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts  invoiced were correct.  Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power  purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase  of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's next  day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of   creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs.  These  notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and Calpine has  provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force  majeure.  When pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state  that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking  valves, etc.  Clear Lake Facility -  The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to  deliveries at this facility.  This may be because the contract covering the  base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was  negotiated by ENA in 1995.  Midcon remains connected to the facility and  delivers certain quantities of market priced gas.  Market priced gas is  required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes  supplied under the 1995 agreement.  Should the power purchase agreement be  amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser  cancel the power purchase agreement, Calpine has negotiated an amendment  allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery  points.  Currently, HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force  majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility  which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A-S  pipeline.  It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacity  to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not.

"Jared,  The CES GISB was never entered into between CES and FGU.  I have reviewed  their requested special provisions and they do not make any sense.  Why  should we pay the 5 days before they pay us if we are each selling to the  other, the imbalance provisions works the way it is set up in the GISB and  their language does not.  Theirs attempts to roll defaults and imbalances  together and those are two separate concepts.  As such I have instructed  Debra to prepare our standard GISB with our standard special provisions and  forward same to Michelle and yourself.  If you have any questions please call  me and we can discuss.

"Grant,    Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.  7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  ""(b) file a petition  or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a  proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of  creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains  undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected  Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such  proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable  documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be  dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to  effectuate such dismissal,""  8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  ""20 or more Gas Days"" is acceptable.  13. I will change the definition of ""Act"" as you suggest.  21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt  to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by  mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the  satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the  use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution?  22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into  transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the  trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.   However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people  on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is  signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction  with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course,  the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact  list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?

I was out of town again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.  Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple of additional inquiries.  7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2. Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.  8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?  13. Definition of ""Act.""  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and 9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge, though I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.  21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if I have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can cost almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation, but the ""rules of engagement"" are not as tight as are found in arbitration. We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to arbitration.  22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list. Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an unfavorable experience with another Texas-based energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.  Thanks.  Grant.   -----Original Message-----   From: Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com [mailto:Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com]   Sent: Thursday, March 08, 2001 3:13 PM   To: grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us   Cc: Kim.Ward@enron.com   Subject: RE: Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement     << File: 2001-002ctr.doc >> << File: 0071988 RESO Enron.doc >>   (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)    Grant,        I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which   do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected   in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:        1.   I have deleted the word ""DRAFT"".        2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001   when the contract would be executed by the City.        3.   I have changed the word ""may"" to ""shall"".        4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a   Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by   a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an omission.        5.   I have added the word ""reasonable"".        6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is   provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the   statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement,   then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a   Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period   should not be necessary to attain closure.        7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should   be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's   obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend   the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was   pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was   otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.        8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.   During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire   period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a   scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any month.        9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no   separate rating applies to ENA.        10.  I have changed ""a"" to ""the""        11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an   event of Force Majeure.        12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being   due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the   language would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance   that a particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as   written.        13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested   that you review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes   were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling   it in using language that had been provided by the City.        14.  I added the word ""reasonable"".        15.  I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP.        16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the   provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2%   over prime language.        17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change   needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment   grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB. ENA is not a   rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating.        18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the   requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to   have made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to   know that before we execute the Contract.        19.  I have added the word ""reasonable"".        20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter   should have the legal right to obtain the information based on its   contract.        21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated. We can agree   to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am   willing to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer.        22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our   Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely   allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis   that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.   Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.   We believe that each party should be responsible for the actions of its   employees and should stand behind any transactions that those parties may   enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Contract.         I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if   you care to discuss any of these matters.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has   reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional   changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions   about certain of its terms and conditions.    Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the   exhibits.    1.  There is the word ""DRAFT"" above the title of the Enfolio agreement   which   should be deleted.    2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words ""1st   of   January, 2001.""  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the   contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs   the   contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the   to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.    3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron   (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.   Therefore, the City requests the word ""may"" should be changed to ""shall.""    4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence: Buyer's Requested   Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the   Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.   How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's   Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the   omission?    5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to ""reasonable   attorneys' fees"" yet line 15 refers to ""attorneys' fees."" To be internally   consistent, line 15 should say ""reasonable attorneys' fees.""    6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the   determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared. It's unclear   whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination   before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled   to   receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is   obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the   City to exercise these rights.    7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a   bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under   bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek   dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section   that   backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.    8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change ""30 days"" to ""5 days.""  The   City   is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to   Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.    9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.   (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?   Please explain.    10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is ""a Company"" supposed to refer to ""the Company""   ?    11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision   as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event   (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the   60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California   law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.    12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We   don't understand it.    13.  Appendix ""1"":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?    14.  Appendix ""1"", Claims, line 4:  Please add ""reasonable"" before   ""attorneys' fees.     15.  Appendix ""1"", GAAP:  This should read: ""GAAP means generally accepted   accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and   governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently   applied,   with respect to Customer.""    16.  Appendix ""1"", Interest Rate:  Please delete ""two percent over"".  The   City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime   should not apply to it.    17.  Appendix ""1"", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the   City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,   what is ENA's bond rating?  Is ""BBB-"" an investment grade rating?    18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the   opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being   deleted.  But the ""Representations and Warranties"" is nevertheless included   in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not   undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue   an   opinion.  We would like to delete ""and (vii) it is not ... Party.""    19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add ""reasonable"" before   ""attorneys' fees.""    20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by ""to the extent it has a   legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc.""    21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of   legal   policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes. Is Enron   amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my   opinion.    22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include   a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on   behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to   this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.    Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I   hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for   response.    Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today   until Wednesday, March 7.

Aside from the different possible interpretations of the language: ""If Enron  Americas nominates gas for transportation on the SNG pipeline system ..."", I  would like to understand your opinion on the ability of El Paso Merchant  Energy to bind Enron to enter into an agreement with a party who is not a  party to the agreement.  Is this legally enforceable?  After all, Southern  Natural Gas does not have a similar obligation.  If it were to be legally binding, under what terms and conditions would Enron  be obligated to enter into such agreement?  I am thinking in particular of  the fact that Southern Natural Gas has received authorization from the FERC  to enter into transportation arrangements at negotiated rates.  If we were to  locate a customer that could be accessed by means of a bypass pipeline at a  lower effective cost than the Southern Natural Gas full rate, would we be  entitled to hold out for a discounted rate with Southern Natural Gas?

"Kim,  I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.   1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase ""with annual redetermination""  however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would  suggest that the phrase be deleted. 2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to  put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum  such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap? 3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed  Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern  transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and  if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?    Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.

Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle  deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We  are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with  our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place  once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts in  place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?

"Deirdre,  A red line provided by Kim Decell is attached at the end of this email.   Without getting into the language specifics which need to be addressed, the  areas of concern relate to Transaction formation procedure (verbal versus  signed agreement), Nominated Quantity and Maximum Daily Quantity is used  interchangeably when the term most likely should be Daily Contract Quantity  or Minimum Daily Quantity.  Term Purchase Quantity is used which means that a  default cannot occur until the end of the term when there is no longer any  time left for the buyer to be able to request the necessary quantities  (default to be determined by using the last day(s) of term prices eventhough  default may have occurred on the front end of transaction), Provides for  fixed prices without obligation of any fixed volumes, Point of Sale and Point  of Receipt needs to be made the same, Limitation of Liability and  Responsibility for Taxes need to be changed to Enron language, Triggering  Events needs to be expanded to fit Enron concepts, No free walks for  regulatory risks, force majeure needs to address Enron concepts, corporate  guaranty needs to be payment not performance, collateral threshold needs to  be reinserted and updated by Credit for Master verses one-off language. ----- Forwarded by Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT on 04/02/2001 02:06 PM -----   ""Kim Decell"" <kdecell@gassupplyconsulting.com>  03/21/2001 10:29 AM        To: <Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com>    cc:     Subject: RE: WPS contract   Dan,  I have attached a document which compares the draft Master Contract to last year's contract.  The majority of the changes you will see are necessary to convert a deal-specific contract to something more like a set of ""general terms and conditions"" that will be supplemented with the deal-specifics in a Transaction Confirmation.  These essential changes include (1) the replacement of any deal-specific item such as price, point of sale, contract quantity with a reference to the Transaction Confirmation, (2) the inclusion of language for Firm Baseload, Firm Swing and Firm Swing with Term Purchase Quantity so that all types of purchase arrangements are addressed and (3) the addition of Sections 1, 2 and 4 to introduce and explain ""Master Contract"" and ""Transaction Confirmation"".  These changes necessarily lead to more definitions.  In addition, we have created our own Events of Default language which is almost identical to Enron's Triggering Events language.  We can discuss any changes you might like to make to our language.  The remaining variances, with 2 notable exceptions, are subject to negotiation and these include liability language at Section 10.3 and the removal or replacement of Locked Prices language at Section 8.3.  The 2 items we are not willing to change are (1) Section 9 Taxes and (2) the addition of the previous Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold language.  These were accepted last year ONLY because the parties had agreed to certain purchase terms and the effective date of the contract had passed.  For all the reasons above, we cannot use last year's contract verbatim. However, I believe what we have is, with the 2 exceptions, very similar to last year's contract.  I appreciate that we all spent a lot of time getting last year's contract finalized and it reinforced the need for us to have an executed set of general terms & conditions in place PRIOR to the bidding process.  We are targeting March 31 for execution of Master Contracts with all parties desiring to bid in Wisconsin Public Service's RFP, which is expected to take place in early April.  I will be out of the office from 10 am today until Monday, but if you need to contact me during this time, either leave a voice mail, which I will be checking, or send an email which will be forwarded to Tim Sexton.

"Grant,   I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order,  please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signature  by Enron.  I will attach a list of current traders who might be available to  handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of  incumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return a  fully executed contract for your files.  Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers of  the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties.   Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your  transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for  giving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for  its actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.  Likewise, if  Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto and  Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO  notification, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such  failure.

Under Term, you have included the phrase ""with annual redetermination""  however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would  suggest that the phrase be deleted. 2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to  put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum  such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap? 3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed  Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern  transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and  if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?    Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.

The little boy got really excited and said, ""That's the puppy I want to buy!""  The man replied ""No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you really want him, I'll give him to you."" The little boy got upset. He looked straight into the man's eyes and said ""I don't want you to give him to me. He is worth every bit as much as the other dogs and I'll pay the full price.* In fact I will give you $2.37 now and 50 cents every month until I have him paid for.""  The man countered, ""You really don't want to buy this puppy son. He is never gonna be able to run, jump and play like other puppies."" The little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace.* He looked up at the man and said, ""Well, I don't run so well myself and the little puppy will need someone who understands.""

I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always  be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less  than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company.

By way of  examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that  Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and  Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that  event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from  Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the  price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in  3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's  total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual  purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ  would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price  in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3).   2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should  Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties  are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas  requirements, then no buyback would be applicable.   3.

"Grant,  I do not think that their new language will work in the way they think it  will.  What Bruce indicated to me was that if they determined that they had  volumes after 9:00 they would offer to us.  If we didn't accept, then they  wanted the right to go to another market which might be in the Chicage area.

Mike came up with the wording below to give Crestar the option to move gas after 9:00am.  Please review and if you are in agreement please make the change to the subject agreement.  Thanks, ------  Bruce Kohrs Phone: (403)205-7684 Fax: (403)266-1947 e-mail:bruce_kohrs@keyspancanada.com   RE: Transaction No. 1a; March 22, 2001  We are writing to obtain your waiver of certain requirements under the subject agreement.  The specific circumstance of concern arises where, prior to 9:00 am on a Nomination Day, CEMC advises Enron that it will not deliver gas or will deliver less than the maximum DCQ, because CEMC does not expect to have sufficient volumes available on the next Gas Day to enable it to utilize all of Customer's AOS.  Should circumstances change after 9:00 am on a Nomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes available on the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOS to deliver those additional volumes.  If you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlined above, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy of this letter provided for that purpose.  ------  Bruce Kohrs Phone: (403)205-7684 Fax: (403)266-1947 e-mail:bruce_kohrs@keyspancanada.com ",grant.oh@enron.com,dan.hyvl@enron.com,proposed amendment to CEMC/Enron Alliance AOS agreement,2001-04-20 09:58:00-07:00,sent

I have just been through the annual pilgrimage of torture and humiliation known as buying a bathing suit.  When I  was a child in the 1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed for a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not so much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and they did a good job.  Today's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a figure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she can either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral suit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped from Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill department store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to a designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.  What choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and entered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first thing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch material.  The  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to launch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that if you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected from shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a swipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.  I fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder strap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared! Eventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a while to  find the other.  At last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is that   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant to wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.  I realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full view assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it only fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me oozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a lump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.  As I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the pre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, ""Oh There you are!"" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so sure and asked what else she had to show me.  I tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of masking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an oversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of leopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like Tarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.  I tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in mourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I thought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.  Finally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style bottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and bulge  friendly, so I bought it.  When I got home, I read the  label which said ""Material may become  transparent in water."" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just have to stay out of  the water!",stacy.dickson@enron.com,dan.hyvl@enron.com,Choosing a New Bathing Suit,2001-04-24 08:04:00-07:00,sent

I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options  should calculate to be around $230,000.  However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by  extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They  will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to  put facilities in the ground.

"Darren,  There are no previous confirmations.  You have one single purpose contract  that was done in 1994 that has a primary term through 8/31/02.  What do you  mean ""preceding confirmations"".  Confirmations are only done under trading  type master contracts.  That does not apply to the current contract with  Haldor.  You should become familar with the current contract before you  request changes to that deal.

I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options  should calculate to be around $230,000.  However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by  extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They  will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to  put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell  me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

The issue under consideration is      one of         eligibility.  The risk profile of existing trades is not a primary         concern. Under US derivative law, customers must have $10MM total      assets         or $1MM shareholder equity or be guaranteed by such an entity or      post         cash/LCs in amounts reasonably approximating risk potential.      Because         ENA is a US registered company and its subsidiary, Enron Capital &      Trade         Resources International Corp. is a US registered company and both         entities are trading derivatives with Total International, we must         establish eligibility under one of the above criterion before      trading         any futher.  Again, credit risk of existing trades is not      considered the         issue.  Satisfaction of eligiblity criterion is the issue.  To this         point, Total International has not guaranteed this entity and no         financial statements have been provided. We must somehow work      together         to satisify these eligibility concerns.  Let me know what you      think.

"   Health Tips and News    The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:     Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this  true?    A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything   wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live  longer;   that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it   faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.     Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?    A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and   corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an   efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?   Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy   vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily   allowance of vegetable slop.     Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?    A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we   all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories= :   animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not   animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only   leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy  your   liquid vegetables.     Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?    A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to   one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.      Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to ""spot"" for him while he did the bench   press. What did he mean?    A: ""Spotting"" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up   your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin= d   that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t= o   reevaluate your exercise program.     Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis= e   program?    A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No  Pain.     Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?    A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If   you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.     Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?    A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In   fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be  bad for   you?     Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?    A: Thicker gravy.     Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the   middle?    A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul= d   only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.    I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.  =7F <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> Shawn Shafai IT Project Manager, Global Extranet Management Cisco Systems, Inc.

"----- Forwarded by Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT on 04/27/2001 12:23 PM -----     Health Tips and News    The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:     Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this  true?    A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything  wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live  longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it  faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.     Q:  Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?    A:  You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and   corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an   efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?   Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy   vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily   allowance of vegetable slop.     Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?    A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we   all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories:   animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not   animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only   leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy  your liquid vegetables.     Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?    A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to   one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.      Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to ""spot"" for him while he did the bench   press. What did he mean?    A: ""Spotting"" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up   your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you find   that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought to   reevaluate your exercise program.     Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise   program?    A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No  Pain.     Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?    A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If   you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.     Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?    A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In   fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for   you?     Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?    A: Thicker gravy.     Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the   middle?    A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You should   only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.    I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.

"Dave,  I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I  have a number of questions. 1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on  Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery  point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB.   2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also  talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally  their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction.   3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the  same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional  20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than  the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without  making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for  such non scheduled excess volumes?   Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the  transaction agreement.

I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options  should calculate to be around $230,000.  However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by  extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They  will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to  put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell  me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

As  I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this  is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is  the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead  of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not  needed.

It was so nice to have all the moms that are still with us around and to be able to serve them for once. Celebrating Mom's birthday on Saturday should be great. Just let me know what to bring and I'll be there. In regards to Mom...yes, she seems quite concerned about us putting her into a nursing home if she lets on that she forgets things; she was almost in tears when she talked about it, remember Doris? Anyway, we need to attempt to assure her that won't happen as long as she continues to take her tests and medicines as she needs to. I agree with Bill that we might want to consider a checking account which requires 2 signatures over a certain amount (say $500 or $1000..whatever we agree is a ""safe"" amount)...Doris would be the most likely candidate, I feel, since she is there and much more aware of Mom's daily needs or desires. She must understand that by doing this, we would not ""take control"" of her money...just help her ""remember"" payment of large purchases. She still needs to be able to buy what she wants or needs...Our concern is someone ""conning"" her out of money without her realization of it.Requiring 2 signatures on checks over a certain dollar amount would help, I feel. Anyway, you'all think about it. Other suggestions? Doris, you see the day-to-day activities, so you are probably best to bring to Dan and my attention matters that appear to be a problem for Mom....and between the 3 of us, surely we can work out a solution that helps Mom and still lets her maintain her dignity and respect. OK>>>>see you'all on the 3rd...let me know what things I need to bring..Wanna get a gift? I was thinking that a Bunn coffee maker would be so nice for her...quick coffee, and ready whenever she wants it...plus maybe it won't spill all over the counter, etc. when poured..Think about it, if you'all want to go in on it together...If not for her birthday..maybe Christmas? ..Just a thought.

We had a really good time also. I think Mom enjoyed it also. Getting together for Mom's birthday sounds great to me Only have one suggestion. Tell Mom that we are taking her out for her birthday or else she will try to cook everthing. Then we can all show up with the food. I don't know what to say about how she would feel about losing control of her checking account. Some days she seems really concerned about what she has in the bank and other times she handles things well. She did give Buddy a signed blank check to go pay for fertilizer on a Sat. and then when he went to pay for it on Mom. evening she had already gone in and paid for it herself that morning.

"Jeff,  We talked about my joining HPL after the sale was consummated several weeks  ago.  You had indicated that you would work up some information and send it  to me.  Is it ready?  Gary Prescott and I have verbally agreed to a level of  compensation which I understand you are working into a document.  He has also  assured me that I will be credited with my initial start date which is March  9, 1967 and be fully vested in the various benefit, retirement and vacation  plans.  Can you confirm this?  Enron has indicated that since I am over 55, I  will be fully vested in any unvested options, however, all of my options will  need to be exercised on the earlier of the original expiration date or a date  that is 3 years from the time I leave Enron's employment.  They indicated  that it makes no difference if I retire or terminate.  I can see no benefit  in retirement from Enron because I am currently vested in the savings plan  which I will roll over to an investment account when I leave Enron and I see  no reason to sign up for the Enron Retirement Health Benefits because AEP  appears to have a similar retirement health benefit plan.  Isn't this the  case?

"Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL  had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61and would it be appropriate for  HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream.   The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates  to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 payments were made  pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a  day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the wells, has made a  reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream  represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information provided does not  indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the reallocation, HPL  or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that has now been  allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility  for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from  the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly written  correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it  did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes.  That  contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation  evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes should have been  sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy  of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the  Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated that since HPL's  agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved  through arbitration.  Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum  of $328,508.61 from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such sum  in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL needs to be aware that in the  event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to  remit such amount together with interest to Upstream.","janie.aguayo@enron.com, bryce.baxter@enron.com",dan.hyvl@enron.com,"Re: Upstream Energy Services Cio, L.L.C.",2001-05-16 10:12:00-07:00,sent

A class of elementary students started a class project to make a planter to take home and wanted to have a plant in it that was easy to take care of, so it was decided to use cactus plants. The students were given greenware pottery of a clown planter, and they painted them with glaze and had them professionally fired at a class outing so they could see the process. It was  great fun.  They planted the cactus seeds in the finished planters, and they grew nicely but unfortunately the children were not allowed to take them home.  The cactus plants were removed and a small ivy replaced them, and the children were then allowed to take the planters home.  The teacher said cactus seemed like a good idea at the time....

"Thanks for the red-line version.  Here are my comments:  ? In paragraph 10.1, a triggering event would allow close out netting of all  transactions under this agreement and any other agreements between the  parties.  And then in paragraph 10.4, it retiturates this point and expands  on it by bringing in all amounts owed by all affiliates of both parties.   This is pretty vague.  Historically, only amounts owed by the defaulting  party to that of the non-defaulting party and its affiliates have been  included.  Can we combine the effect of this within a single paragraph.  That  way, we're not speaking of the same issue within two different sections. ? In paragraph 10.1, cross-default seems a bit vague.  What I was trying to  say was, ""If any indebtedness in excess of $50MM and $100MM, resepctively  have become or is capable of becoming accelerated"" and then expressly define  indebtedness to include all borrowed monies, accounts payable, and financial  deriviative transactions.  Without expansion, i believe indebtedness is  typically meant to include only bank debt. ? If we made them reference Utilicorp United, Inc. as a specified entity,  then we could tie all terms, conditions, and support back to them  indirectly.  Could we take a look at amending the contract to accomplish  this.  It would really strengthen the contract. ? I am surprised they did not tie any guaranty support from Enron Corp. to  this contract.  They missed this one. ? I am ok with the 2 day LC turn around under a triggering event, although I  do not like item c - ""be unable to pay its debts as they fall due"" - I would  like to strike this line.  thats it.

I think we need to change the first  paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that  we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different  ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise  the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration  of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

Can you send me your fax number so I can get you the legal description.  Also, I don't think a duration time is necessary.  It would be in HPL's best interest to have this easement in perpetuity.

I think we need to change the first  paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that  we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different  ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise  the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration  of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

TransCanada is not optimistic that the buy/sell will be signed prior to the closing date of the sale of TransCanada's gas marketing business, and feels it would be in the best interest of both parties to move these trades to a signed agreement, rather than letting them continue under unsigned paper.  Enron reference number:  QF7769.1/526974 (TC reference #277157) QF8940.1/527655 (TC reference #277158) QG6978.1/533356 (TC reference #277455) 704599 (TC reference #277703) 1122197 (TC reference #293254)  TransCanada would appreciate Enron's consideration of transferring the following deals as well, although I do not have Enron's reference number for these transactions (I will fax copies of TransCanada's confirms, if that would be useful):  TC274748:  Apr/01 - Nov/01 TC buys 10,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@ Niagara); trade date - 11/08/00 TC276714:  Apr/01 - Nov/01 TC buys 10,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@ Dawn); trade date - 12/05/00 TC278366:  Nov/01 - Apr/02 TC sells 5,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@ Dawn); trade date - 12/26/00 TC284004:  Nov/01 - Apr/02 TC buys 5,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@ Dawn); trade date - 12/01/00 TC297698:  June/01 - Nov/01 TC sells 5,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@ Dawn); trade date - 05/15/01 TC298717:  Apr/01 - Nov/01 TC buys 10,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@ Dawn); trade date - 2/21/01 TC298720:  Apr/01 - Nov/01 TC buys 10,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@ Dawn); trade date - 02/22/01  I believe Enron originally proposed the buy/sell agreement for these transactions due to their duration or perhaps because at their trade dates, their start dates were in some cases more than 6 months out.  The signed GISB between the parties includes special conditions which make the GISB contract more suitable for term trades than an unaltered GISB. For this reason, and because most of these transactions are now flowing, I am hopeful that Enron will be agreeable to moving these trades to the signed GISB, so that the unsigned buy/sell file may be closed.  Thank you for your consideration of this matter.  My telephone number is 403.213.5621.  After June 8th I will be away from the office on maternity leave.

"Melissa,  The maximum rate which HPL is authorized to impose for 311 transportation  service may be established by either a rate proceeding before the FERC which  would have to be renewed every 3 years or by using the margin component of a  city gate rate which has been approved by the state regulatory agency.  In  HPL's case, HPL has filed with the FERC that its rates will be the margin  component of the City Gate Rate approved in Docket No. 592 before the Texas  Railroad Commission.  This allows HPL to use this margin determined as  provided in the February 8, 1974 contract between Entex and HPL as its  maximum rate for 311 service.  That is one of the reasons that HPL continues  to sell certain volumes of gas to Entex under that contract.   You can  probably contact Steve VanHooser for any documentation that he may have  concerning the applicable FERC filings if Tom Shelton does not already have  such information.

"Robin,  At Jeff's request, I have reviewed the attached form which National Fuel  provided.  It is not designed to operate as a Trading Contract.  Transactions  are only formed by signing an Exhibit A to be prepared by National.  The  Exhibit A is to have a Daily Transaction Quantity and National may nominate  from 0 to 100% of that quantity each day.  Penalties only arise if the actual  quantity deviates from their nominated quantity.  Seller to pay difference  between Buyer's replacement price and the Gas Commodity Charge times the  deficiency quantity.  Buyer to pay difference between the Gas Commodity  Charge and the Daily Midpoint Price times the deficiency quantity.   Does not  state what quantity is to be applied against the Gas Demand Charge; however,  does state that if Seller has a force majeure the Gas Demand Charge is only  applied against the actual volumes that Seller delivers and that the Gas  Demand Charge is not reduced if Buyer declares a Force Majeure.  Buyer's  payments are to be trued up to the actual quantities delivered should actuals  deviate from the nominated quantities.

"A woman goes to her boyfriend's parents' house for dinner. This is to be her  first time meeting the family and she is very nervous. They all sit down and  begin eating a fine meal.  The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness  and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are almost making her eyes water.  Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out  a dainty fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof.  Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked  over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a  rather stern voice, ""Skippy!""  The woman thought, ""This is great!"" and a big smile came across her face. A  couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time,  she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The  father again looked and the dog and yelled, ""Dammit Skippy!""  Once again the woman smiled and thought ""Yes!"" A few minutes later the woman  had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let  rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.  Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, ""Dammit  Skippy, get away from her before she craps all over you!""","stacy.dickson@enron.com, becky.spencer@enron.com",dan.hyvl@enron.com,THE SMELLY SCAPEGOAT,2001-06-15 01:13:00-07:00,sent
