"Rick,  It would be difficult to use option approach to directly to ships (no  historical price series and no regular, continuos markets). The right approach  is th  real options  model that requiresa lot of time to develop.

He said that he generally understands the logic of the deal but  simply wants the risk management discipine applied to analzing the position (a  reiteration of what Rick Buy had said in our meeting today).  I would simply  ask Vince's team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand  alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price  movements.   This would be much easier than the Rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly  look at the value of the options on the other two ships.  In other words we  could look at two ship  long positions with some implied volatilities and  also estimate daily VARs on the ships as if they were mark to market  (although I agree with David that we will not likely be able to mark the  ships because they will be treated as leases).

I would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do  power and gas positions.  Unfortunately, we do not have that luxury and  sometimes, in absence of true analytics, the most rudimentary measures can  provide the best decision tools.  Here is how we would make the decision:  1)  Our shipping expert confirms that $140 million for a 135,000 ton ship  represents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years  and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently.  He also  confirms that the current trough is the result of the default of several Far  East buyers and that new LNG orders and other ship building (cruise liners)  have reduced the over capacity.  His experience and historic analysis has  suggested that the pricing cycle for LNG ships lasts for a significant  period.  New efficiency measures should reduce new build prices (and allow  for a lower trough), but not by an extreme amount versus the $140 million  cost of this vessel.     Pierre normally likes to roll time charters; however, this is difficult in an  illiquid shipping market like LNG.  He would purchase this ship if the LNG  shipping book were his to manage.  He estimates the ship could be sold in a  distressed sale for $110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a  long term basis at a value of up to $200 million.    2)  Our development teams in Spain, Italy and Turkey have been trying to  solve the big question - gas.  In each country, the key to developing a  merchant plant is securing gas flexibility or at least securing negotiating  leverage with the monopoly gas supplier.  It is questionable whether or not  this decision will have an immediate impact on Arcos.  The plant's time line  and the realities of the LNG supply market may require that we commit to Gas  Natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured.   The shear  threat of being able to bring spot or term LNG to these markets will improve  our negotiating leverage and/or allow us to create flexibility.  Going  forward, however, other potential plant opportunities in Spain, and elsewhere  in the Med region, may have the capacity to utilise these vessels.   I think  that this flexibility is worth at least $25 million to me.  3)  I would summarise:   Upside   $60 + $25 = $85 million      Downside           ($30) + $25 =             ($5)  million  I would do it.

RAC, however, is close to  finishing a new process for commodity embedded financings--both prepaids and  tilted swaps--that would not require a full DASH but an abbreviated approval  document based upon specified credit ratings, financing amounts, and  maturities for transactions having standard credit documentation.  For  example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AAA counterparty with  standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated  approval document.  This abbreviated approval document would only be  available for transactions meeting these criteria if:  (i) structured  financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is  manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (iii) the pricing met  a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate  credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium.  The abbreviated approval document is intended to expedite the approval of  relatively straightforward embedded financings where a full DASH is  impractical or inefficient.  It is presently contemplated that the  abbreviated approval document could be approved with two signatures:  the  Originator's and  a RAC signature (either Bill Bradford's or mine), with  business unit management and EGF receiving weekly updates on transactions  approved via this document, but I would welcome your thoughts on this.  In  any event, I will provide you with the proposed abbreviated process by you  for your review and concurrence before if it is implemented since the  preponderance of these transactions are expected to be originated by ENA.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark  should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues  but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we  watch the funds flow issues.

Here's the story:   On October 30, I received a funding request for my  approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request on   the Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,500 exploratory well in the Cypress Program.    The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had Don  Rollins check it out .   Don discovered that we had already paid our cash  call and this cash call represented our working interest partner, Kelley  Oil's share, which is a highly unusual situation.  Checking further we  discovered that  the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement from  Kelley, who wanted to be operator.  Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron  (not Kelley)  to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not want  to be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospect  generator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator.  Kelley was upset about  this and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash call  provisons were deleted.  Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed the  agreement which has no initials from the Legal Department.   The effect of  this was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill and  collect from Kelley.  Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primary  credit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners pay  their share of well costs before costs are incurred.  This can be  particularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of cost  overruns that partners don't  want to pay.  In this case, our surrogate  operator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and no  money of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to be  prepaid by Enron 100%.  The well is heavily front end loaded with costs with  a total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!)  I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed  that we  are forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shut  down operations.   Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation  (and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase.  Lessons Learned:    1) The E&P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S.  Louisiana exploratory test.    2)  Important provisions, like ""cash call"" should never be given away  without appropriate risk assessment and approval.  Please call if you have questions.

As I mentioned in my voicemail to  you, I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had  not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA.  I obtained copies  of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation  developed.  Steve was out of the office much of last week; he followed up  Friday with the attached email message.   As Steve mentions in his email, there were extenuating circumstances and  timing issues, but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a  well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed  without appropriate review and approval.  I understand that John Thompson and  Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a  term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in  short order.   Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get  documentation finalized and in form for Steve's execution.  From Steve's  reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout (which  had been initialled by Allen), I believe he had assumed that had been the  case in this situation as well, although he did not try to place  responsibility on Allen.  Steve is one of the best and the brightest I've worked with at Enron.  He is  extremely busy, working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E & P  assets, as well as working on new deals.  I have worked with Steve enough to  know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures.   I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated.  I will remind  the ECR group at Monday's staff meeting that review by the legal department  is required before any agreements are signed.  Where do we go from here?  Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with  Steve?  Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me  to do.   Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email.  In light of the level of  activity for new ECR deals, time that is required in assisting Global Finance  with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs, and the increased legal time  required as Bonne Terre, Cypress, and Vastar are no longer managed by third  parties, being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is  increasingly difficult, and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed  soon.

The circumstances of the event follow to  the best of my knowledge, without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is  presently inaccessible:  Rozel Energy, led by Bill Rogers, identified a high potential / relatively  low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil & Gas (sub of  Contour Energy).  He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley  controlled 90%+ of the acreage, but it was set to expire on Sept. 28, 2000.  Rozel, after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and  receiving approval to do so, sought to acquire top leases over the prospect  only to find that others had already top-leased a significant portion of the  prospect.  Had the Kelley lease expired, these parties would have controlled  and drilled the prospect.  Rozel, with the help of Allen Wilhite, approached Kelley for a farmout.   Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that  Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately 50% of its interest, or  farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or  higher ORRI at its option.  Kelley elected to participate for 50% of its interest in the well before the  farmout agreement was drafted.  Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief  letter agreement.  Kelley sought to operate the well, which ECR rejected due  to Kelley's poor track record in drilling deep S. Louisiana wells.  Rozel  Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle.   Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S. Louisiana, Stokes and  Speiler, who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine, who each  have over 25 years experience in mangement of drilling operations.  Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute, the negotiation of the  JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was non-responsive to  Allen's efforts to finalize the agreement.  Allen, Craig Fox, Arvel Martin  and I met with Kelley's Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a  dialogue and rapport (we thought).  The initial draft of the farmout  agreement was put together on Sept. 15th by Kelley and Allen.  Allen did not  share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal  provisions, particularly who would operate.  ECR members were in dispute over  the importance of operations.  With Kelley's consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach  terms with Kelley, we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior  to the Sept. 28th lease expiration.  Allen and I continued to be frustrated  with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was  spudded.  I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an  agreement signed by Kelley on October 16, 2000 (effective Sept. 15, 2000).    Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelley's offices to deliver  the document, I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no.  I asked  him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs, and he said it  was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions.  I did not ask  specifically about farmout agreements.  The Kelley farmout was the first  farmout in a directly-owned asset that I had encountered.  I failed to  recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed  by our GP's in our Juniper, Bonne Terre (historically) and Texland ventures,  and a farmout with Enron's name on the line.  It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review.  I have  been made aware that farmout agreements and JOA's in directly owned assets  (as opposed to LP's with a GP such as Juniper) require Legal review and  signoff.  The compliance meeting last week underscored that point.  We had  outside counsel (Lisa Jaubert) under your direction review the Tri-C and  Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval.   I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be  diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt  as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or  issue.  The demands that our large oil & gas exploration portfolio places on you is  another issue that we should discuss.  The Bonne Terre, Cypress and Vastar  ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will  continue.  Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA  (to be held in BT Exploration LLC) will increase the legal and commercial  activity level.  We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted  and will be spudded in the next 10 days, so expect to see a farmout agreement  on the S. Riceville prospect late next week.  I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in  person if you desire.  I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval  of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the  mistake.  I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the  immediate future on our direct-owned ventures.   I look forward to working  with you on ways to better manage our business process in Cypress-Acadian,  Bonne Terre & Vastar ventures.

"Mark- here is my response to your request. Call with questions.  Goal: Total Foreign Exchange Exposure quantified and communicated to BOD.  Performance: Project completed with final tranche of results reported to Finance Committee  Dec 11. The notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on  earnings and CTA accounts have been quantified and reported to the BOD over  the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to. Also, a  template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes  in the future. Enron has never had a comprehensive review of FX exposure  prior to this activity. As an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging  activity resulting from this effort.  Goal: Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES.  Performance: Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across  EES. A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results  presented to the Finance Committee. A RAC task force has been put in place  which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has  agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit  control systems where they need to be. Significant progress has been made  against these recommendations. DSM projects have been spot tested with  outside measurement firm and the results reported to EES. These tests have  highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best  employed.  Goal: Solidify the global risk management policy beyond Houston and London.  Performance: Complete and Ongoing. During 2000, Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC  which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking  place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to. A data base  system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these  offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to.  Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC, AA, and operations to really  understand where we have risks.

My comments follow:  Cost:  the DASH is incorrect.  EECC has provided both a cost - plus price and  a guaranteed price. EECC has provided a NEPCO-guaranted price of $215MM. EECC has indicated that it's estimate of actual costs is most likely $205MM.   We indicated this cost estimate was somewhat conservative.  Since last week,  the cost estimate has been further revised to $202MM.  It is unlikely that  the actual costs of the project will be significantly less than $202MM.   $202MM represents a cost estimate with the Owners maintaining the risk of  overruns and schedule.  This would require the Owner to maintain a  contingency in his proforma above the most likely expected cost of $202MM. After providing the above information to the Developer, the Developer was  going to take a look at the carrying cost of turbines which were inside this  estimate; I have no update on whether the turbine price changed from the  numbers I saw last week. Schedule:  Neither my team nor I had seen the provisions of termination by  Petrobras, as stated in the DASH, prior to last evening.  The ability of  Petrobras to terminate at April 30, 2002 if the project is not completed due  to circumstances within Enron's controls, is an unlikely risk, but not  totally impossible.  Further, the project is subject to a June 30, 2002,  termination by Petrobras if the project is not completed due to force  majeure.  This is considered more of an onerous risk.  It's not clear to me  whether the requirement to complete the pipeline and bring gas to the project  would be considered under Enron's control, considering that Enron is a  partial Owner in CEG, the gas distribution pipeline company. On the other hand, we have indicated that an October 31, 2001 start-up, is  reasonable, based on a full NTP by January 1, and site access on February 1.   If the schedule is constrained by the RAC recommendation to limit expenses to  $15MM, the October 31, start-up could be at risk. Performance:  The stated agreement with Petrobras for 365 megawatts (site  condition) and an average net degraded heat rate of 9169 btu/kWH, appears  correct, if it is LHV. O&M Guarantee:  The DASH is not clear on what O&M availability guarantee  Enron is prepared to sign with Petrobras.  I would suggest that OEC insure it  agrees with any availability guarantees prior to Enron signing the Petrobras  agreement.  Rick, sorry for this late feedback, but our system of coordination with the  RAC needs improvement.  In the days when I worked with EI, EECC would provide  to EI a written due diligence report direct, after checking the proforma  against the PPA.  This was an Enron lesson-learned after years of  experience.  The recent reorganizations have diluted this procedure.  I  suggest I discuss with you how to improve our due diligence process.

James and  I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting  this change  The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any  system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver  completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks  in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in  delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of  meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we  will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve  input validation processes on trade date.

This is in  addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of  delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in  delivering a trade date control process.

We will build on this and hope to have draft positions  and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of  flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston.    I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes  into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and  the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised  tomorrow.

Dear All, It is a pleasant surprise to receive a message from Jim that he is back in Houston again. It reminds me of the days with Enron. Coincidentally, I have heard that Enron office in Bangkok will be completely closed at the end of the year. Thai market is just not sophisticated enough for Enron. I still hope that this great company will come back to my country again perhaps when the power pool becomes a reality. The people I met still asked me about Enron. Even during the annual economic seminar hosted by the US embassy in Septemder this year, one of the speaker from the US has cited Enron as an example of how good a company from the old economy has adopted to the new environment,by trading broad band anb offer risk hedging instruments on line,etc. Apparently, Enron does have some fans here. I, myself, will assume the position of managing director of the Post publishing Company, the owner of Bangkok Post newspaper as from the first of February next year. In the mean time I busy myself as the financial advisor to the City of Bangkok, handling some debt restructuring cases for a living (including one steel plate mill), and exchange gossip on power and telecom projects as hobbies.

Whilst taking a curve  other than the day end curve is relatively easy to do (once we have agreed a  formal procedure and changed the IT feeds) and would give us only minor P&L  concerns on a daily basis there is an impact on determining and hedging our  USD cashflows. This would undoubtedly be a cost to the UK business. Shane is  going to put a note together to outline the issues and have a stab at  attaching a monetary cost (although I expect he will have to guesstimate the  amounts).

For Corinto, the higher discount rate and lower value reflects how RAC would  value this transaction as a new merchant deal, reflecting Nicaragua's  downgrade; the lower discount rate is consistent with the original RAC  discount rate and may be a reasonable discount rate for a completed plant to  a strategic buyer.  Please let me know if you require additional information.  I am happy to  speak with David Haug on these if you'd like.

"A ""Doorstep"" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!! We need immediate action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard was going on there.   We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better. More to come.

Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided  the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be  adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but  others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be  multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each  member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC  group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process  for consideration.  - The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the  commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework. - Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened  awareness of RAC issues. ""De-silo-ization"" . - All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment. - Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude  among the teams. - Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect. -  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will  require more frequent informal meetings. - There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of  credit, market risk or our portfolio. - All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to  help out if needed. - If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen. - Encourage weak links in team to perform. - Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business  unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement. - If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it  with your supervisor. - Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC  and compensation processes.  The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a  catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.  This process should begin immediately.   Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.  Rick   ",sheila.walton@enron.com,rick.buy@enron.com,Memo from Rick with attachment,2001-02-08 09:59:00-08:00,sent

Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided t= he names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adj= usted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but oth= ers will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be multidimensional.=  There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is respons= ible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC group that you a= re in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process for considera= tion.  -=09The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the comme= rcial business units and achieve this within our control framework. -=09Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heighten= ed awareness of RAC issues. ""De-silo-ization"" . -=09All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment. -=09Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitu= de among the teams. -=09Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect. - =09Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions wi= ll require more frequent informal meetings. -=09There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of=  credit, market risk or our portfolio. -=09All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offe= r to help out if needed. -=09If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen. -=09Encourage weak links in team to perform. -=09Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the busin= ess unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement. -=09If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange=  it with your supervisor. -=09Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the = PRC and compensation processes.  The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a cat= alyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.  This process should begin immediately.=20  Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.

"Karen- talked to Whalley on this. He said he is going to kill deal but needs to do it carefully so he doesn't de-motivate people. So I guess we should keep working on it but it most likely won't go anywhere. A big concern Enron has now is that we have $7 billion of int'l assets and the fear is that we lose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets.

"Tim- Thanks for your note. Before Janet D. left she had requested additional resources and we began making arrangements to get people in place. We have assigned Tracy Ngo, Ed Sacks, Paul Radous and Wendy Conwell to power. We also have moved other RAC people into credit, Mark Ruane (VP), Ken Curry (Dir), and Carol North (Mgr). Unfortunately it takes some time to get these people trained on transactional credit issues but they should come along quickly. We are in the market for more.  It might be helpful to know if we could clone Tracy, how many would you need, given your plans in the market. Tracy is one of our best people. Also, does being in Houston work or do we need resources in Portland.   I'll meet w/ Tracy next week when she is in Houston and get her views as well.   Please don't hesitate to let me know if we aren't keeping up and of course if you are gearing up for a new market push and anticipate additional needs let us know ASAP because there is a 12 month or so training period required for a strong performer to get up the Enron curve.

Cc: Foster, Chris Subject: Credit Resources  I understand from Tracy Ngo that as a result of some organizational changes in RAROC there might be some personnel movement in your group.  As indicated in the e-mail below, our Portland Middle Market Group would like to see more resources dedicated to the credit function.  As a result of a number of factors credit is being asked to review a very large number of new counterparties and transactions for the Middle Market Group and it is typically taking 2 - 7 days to get a credit review turned around.  As you know, we believe existing personnel is top notch   There just aren't enough of them.  And, amongst all the RAC groups with whom we work, market risk and credit risk, it seems like resources are more constrained in the credit area.  We would love to see that reduced and anything you could do to make this happen would be appreciated.

We are counting on you to complete credit analyses that allow MM deals to be closed.  Although I don't think we have lost any deals as a result of the not doing credit analyses in time, we have been on the edge for weeks and a couple of deals have come down to the wire.  Anything you can do to allocate additional resources to credit analysis would be appreciated.  There are 3 forces currently aligned that make MM success highly contingent upon your credit group doing credit analyses to allow transactions to be closed.   1.  Movement from WSPP to EEI contracts.  We are at a record pace with respect to getting new master agreements in place with counterparties.  Already this year we have done about 10 - 15 new EEIs, all of which require a credit analysis.    2.  We continue to look at longer dated transactions that require special credit analysis.  3.  California credit risks are particularly high given what is going on with the ""energy crisis.""  The quality of work we get from Tracy, Ed, Wendy and Paul is nothing less than phenomenal.  We also have implemented a priority list that we use to identify the most critical transactions so we do not overburden your people with trivial requests.  It still takes typically about a week to get a credit worksheet done for a new EEI and most new deals are requiring an EEI.  In some cases, a quicker turn around is essential.  It seems to us that additional resources are warranted.    I am pretty sure you are aware of this and are taking whatever action you can, but I thought it would be useful to document our needs to arm you with information if you  have internal negotiations to manage.    Please let me know if you have any questions at 503/464-3822.   Thanks!  Chris    ",tim.belden@enron.com,rick.buy@enron.com,RE: Credit Resources,2001-03-15 13:13:17-08:00,sent

Our Enron Stock Option Plan is monstruously short calls to employees (approximately 45 MM share equivalent in vested, exercisable options).  Over the past few years the stock has traded significantly higher, which has created a large economic loss in the form of potential stock dilution.  In recent weeks, we have worked extensively with members of Fastow and Causey's organization and have been discussing various strategies to mitigate / dampen the dilution effect.  The outstanding issues include:  1.) Banks are approaching their ENE credit limit  2.) There is a tradeoff between accounting and economic value.    We feel that the decision to hedge this program should be influenced by the implied view on the future performance of our stock.  SRM's goal is to create a proposal that will outline the costs/benefits to hedging the stock option program.  In addition, we are in the process of developing a model to identify the various decision inflection points.

Truckers still waiting for signs of pent-up freight demand; earnings shortfalls, layoffs loom  If you are waiting for trucking to kick-start the nation's economic recovery, pull up a chair and wait awhile. Trucking CEOs say they haven't seen this slow a first quarter in a decade.  ""Perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since Swift became a public company in 1990,"" Phoenix-based Swift Transportation Chairman and CEO Jerry Moyes said.  The first-quarter trucking mantra historically has been this: everybody loses money in January, hopes for a break-even February and earns whatever profit there is in the quarter in March. That formula may not hold this year.  Gregory L. Quesnel, president and CEO of Con-Way Transportation Services and Emery Worldwide parent CNF Inc., said the current slowdown was first detected late in the third quarter last year and has become ""more pronounced in each successive quarter."" March, he said, has been ""as disappointing as the first two months this year.""  Layoffs already are occurring at the major LTL carriers. Yellow Freight System has idled as many as 1,000 Teamsters and hundreds of white-collar back-office workers. Most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls that will cause them to miss analysts' first-quarter estimates. But there are deeper fears, too. Marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy. Small, family-owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years ago.  Swift's volume drop-off began with shipments originating on the West Coast in January and February and it is continuing in March, Moyes said. Coupled with reduced demand from the Southwest, Moyes said Swift will not meet analysts' first-quarter earnings expectations. Swift is not alone.  ""We hauled less freight in February than February a year ago,"" said Bob Hammel, executive vice president of Pittsburgh-based Pitt Ohio Express, a leading privately held Eastern regional LTL carrier. ""The slowdown in manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous. Nobody anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off.""  Even Con-Way, the most profitable LTL operation in the past five years, said it would have a decline in first-quarter operating income compared with the year-ago period. Con-Way's tonnage declines were estimated in the ""mid-single-digit"" percentage range.  Roadway Express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to 11 percent below those a year ago, which will result in an approximately one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) decline in its operating ratio. (see sidebar)  Pat Hanley, Overnite Transportation's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said freight figures were flat in February year over year but rose slightly in March. Overnite is the exception to the LTL industry with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year.  ""January was pretty good to us, but February was flat. It's coming back in March. We're probably up in low single digits, 3 to 4 percent. We're picking back up. The economy has hurt us. If you had asked us at the start of the year, we'd have said we'd be up double-digits,"" Hanley said.  The national economic picture is ""a big concern,"" Hanley said. ""We're not seeing pressure on prices, at least not so far. We're seeing customers ship 10 pallets a day instead of 20. The shipment size is coming down. Certainly we're concerned. We'll do O.K., but not as great as we'd like.""  Forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever stars align in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's world. The genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking, which is always a first-in, first-out industry in any economic slowdown.  To hear trucking industry leaders tell it, get comfortable with beans and franks for dinner. It's going to be awhile before it's filet mignon time again.  Shippers see what's happening as well but say it's still too early in the year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks.  ""All the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business levels -- definitely slower than early last year,"" said Bill Huie, assistant vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp., Irving, Texas. ""With a couple of exceptions, carriers we talk with have no plans for expansion in the next few months. We are getting feelers about some possible lane adjustments to boost revenue. But generally it appears a little early in the economic downturn for much price movement.""  The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things. ""Our business is down pretty substantially for the first quarter,"" said Roger Dick, spokesman for Yellow Corp., parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL carriers, Jevic Transportation, Delanco, N.J., and Saia Motor Freight, Duluth, Ga.  USFreightways Corp., citing what it called the nation's ""serious economic slowdown,"" said it expects first-quarter earnings to fall ""very substantially below"" current Wall Street consensus.  Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating environment, USF Chairman, President and CEO Samuel K. Skinner added.  ""Traditionally, the first quarter builds momentum slowly, with March being the strongest month of the period,"" Skinner said in a statement. ""This year, the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in January and February, softening even the normal modest expectations for those two months.""  It's not just the LTL industry that's hurting. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand-supply relationship since analyst James J. Valentine began tracking the data in April 1994. Two events can cause weakness in the index, according to Valentine. They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak freight demand.  ""So far in 2001, we have seen the confluence of both factors, but the fall-off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply,"" Valentine wrote in his most recent ""Trucking Snapshot"" for early March.  Year-to-date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over year, according to Valentine's index, while supply is up only 7 percent. That would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was ""masked by the strong economy,"" Valentine says.  In a more ominous note, Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years. Only a reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand-supply back in balance for the truckload sector in the near term, Valentine predicts.  The overproduction of new Class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at manufacturers, wholesalers and other retailers. Used trucks have lost on average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months. Anecdotally, one used truck dealer, Music City Truck & Equipment, in LaVergne, Tenn., is holding a ""two-for-one"" sale on three- to five-year-old Class 8 Freightliners. You can buy two for around $30,000, less than a brand new Chevy Suburban SUV.  What that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 Class 8 truck for $70,000 and depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the books this year at $35,000. But assuming it has lost 30 percent of that value, it may only be worth $24,500 in actuality. For a carrier with a 100-truck fleet, that equates to a loss of more than $1 million on assets.  The glut may last for a while, according to Valentine's analysis. Assuming a three-year trade-in cycle, most of the Class 8 tractors in the truckload sector are just now rolling over to the used-truck market. That means that overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year. That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business, as did nearly 1,900 carriers last year that either closed or declared bankruptcy.  ""We can see from indexes, surveys and other information available to us that it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight demands will continue to be soft throughout the month. Based on all of these factors, we expect USFreightways' profits for the first quarter to be very substantially less than published analysts' forecasts,"" Skinner said.  In addition, severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle, rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and decreased efficiencies, Skinner added.  Expectations at each of USF's operating companies have been affected, some more than others. The LTL, logistics, reverse logistics and freight-forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a similar period last year, Skinner said.  Further job cuts at USF Worldwide, its freight forwarder, would be in the offing as cost controls at the unit would be ""accelerated"" in the wake of the softening economy, Skinner said. Late last year, Skinner said the rebuilding process at USF Worldwide would be a two-year process. But the worsening economy has made that rebuilding job harder, he said.  ""We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is, in fact, further impeding progress in this area,"" Skinner said. ""During the fourth quarter of 2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001, the company has taken steps to increase cost efficiencies. Among these actions are a substantial cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force. These cost-control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions.""  In the 2000 first quarter, USF posted $22.3 million net income, a 27 percent rise from the $17.5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter. At the time, that was USF's 15th straight quarter-over-quarter earnings increase. It came on $608.2 million revenue, an 18.5 percent rise in from the $513.2 million revenue in the 1999 first quarter. Analysts had been estimating USF to earn about $3.50 a share earnings for 2001, compared with actual $3.61 earnings per share for all of last year. In the fourth quarter last year, USF earned $23.7 million, or 91 cents a share.

Hi everyone,  I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so exclusive, this will have to do for now.  Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for each contract. However, the JC Penny's version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get back.   1) Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done already.  2) The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input credit rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contract period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.  3) Are all ""defaults"" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we are dealing with specific types of firms where ""default"" may not mean we do not get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it's not like Montgomery Ward's where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so fundamental for a company's success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does not neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.  4) A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that don't. By that I mean that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn't.

Hi everyone,  I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so exclusive, this will have to do for now.  Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for each contract. However, the JC Penny's version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get back.   1) Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done already.  2) The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input credit rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contract period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.  3) Are all ""defaults"" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we are dealing with specific types of firms where ""default"" may not mean we do not get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it's not like Montgomery Ward's where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so fundamental for a company's success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does not neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.  4) A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that don't. By that I mean that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn't. This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn't consider. This would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve.  5) This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special finance team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If we can combine our customers into ""exposure group portfolios"" (for lack of a better term), where a group has similar ""risk characteristics"" beyind the current parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.  6) A technical point.

"This is a good article, on balance. Interesting how utilities have charged the highest rates. Tx, Rick   -----Original Message----- From:  Schneider, Chip   Sent: Monday, April 16, 2001 12:50 PM To: Calger, Christopher; Steffes, James; Ngo, Tracy Cc: Buy, Rick; Gorte, David Subject: Article on Power/Enron from the Seattle Times    From the Seattle Times (seattletimes.com)  Energy costs soak City Light by Jim Brunner <mailto:jbrunner@seattletimes.com> Seattle Times staff reporter Seattle City Light spent a record $92 million buying power on the market in March, more than any month in its 91-year history. City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and businesses eclipsed the previous records - $84 million set in February and nearly $80 million in January. To put that in perspective: In 1999, before the current power crisis, the utility's total power bill for the entire year was $90 million. ""We're spending that every month now. The dollars that are involved are staggering,"" said Paula Green, deputy superintendent of City Light. It's a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washington's drought, which means less water in the reservoirs at city-owned dams. That increases Seattle's need to purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented levels. Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most of that money is flowing to out-of-state utilities and power brokers who are profiting enormously from the energy crunch. Last month alone, the bill from Enron, a Houston-based corporation, was $25.5 million, putting it well ahead of the No. 2 seller, California's Sempra Energy, which sold $7.4 million worth of electricity to City Light. City Light still gets most of the 1,200 megawatts necessary to serve its load from city-owned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The utility buys only about 15 percent of its power on the market. But that thin slice now accounts for more than 90 percent of its power costs. Part of the explanation for March's record power-buying binge was City Light's recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the Skagit River instead of spilling it through the dam's power turbines. In a normal water year, City Light officials would be spilling water for energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff. Now, they're saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to generate power for Seattle this summer, when energy prices are expected to surge even higher, to more than $400 per megawatt hour. ""We're insulating ourselves. By putting out one eye now, we're avoiding cutting off our head later,"" said Bob Royer, City Light spokesman. Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain, with a 28 percent City Light rate increase so far this year. More rate increases are likely on the way. Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and Spokane. Meanwhile, Enron's revenues more than doubled last year, to $101 billion. Its stock prices surged to end the year at $88 a share, up from $44 the year before. The stock was trading at $57 a share last week. ""It doesn't just feel unfair, but immoral that these major companies like Enron are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and businesses,"" said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills, who chairs the Council's Energy and Environmental Policy Committee. ""There's this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the shareholders of these companies,"" Wills said. Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price caps. But opponents say price caps would do nothing to encourage the construction of new power plants, or energy conservation. Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said it's unfair to fault the company for selling power at prices dictated by the free market. ""Enron is providing electricity to a market that needs it,"" Denne said. ""It's unfortunate when regulators are pointing fingers, looking to fix blame, when this is a problem of supply and demand."" The company hails from President George W. Bush's home state of Texas, and is one of the top ""soft money"" donors to political campaigns. Enron and its executives gave $435,000 to the Democrats and $1.2 million to Republicans last year, according to Common Cause. Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has consistently been one of the top donors to Bush's presidential and gubernatorial campaigns. Enron doesn't own a lot of dams or power plants. Instead, the company makes money as a middleman - buying power from utilities and then reselling it for a profit. The company, formed in 1985 from the merger of two pipeline companies, has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North America. Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use of the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book online. You just point, click and spend. ""It's easier than Amazon,"" said Steve Lewis, a power marketer with City Light, demonstrating the company's Web site. It lists available power ""products"" and the asking price for both buyers and sellers. Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Light's projected power needs and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next hour, next day or months ahead. They try to find the best price available, but it's clearly a sellers' market. Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost $30 per megawatt hour for more than $200. At times last month, City Light was buying power for $450 a megawatt hour. And it's not because the cost of generation has gone up. ""This is pure profit,"" said Green, deputy superintendent of City Light. There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder than California, whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling the power markets. A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities are paying the highest prices in the nation for the next-day delivery of wholesale power. However, regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices. In fact, some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month were to neighbors. Puget Sound Energy, Western Washington's largest electric utility, charged City Light the highest average price of any seller last month, at $303 per megawatt hour, according to City Light's preliminary billing estimates. Spokane's Avista Energy charged $281. That compares with Enron's average price of $173 per megawatt hour and an overall average of $194. The BPA, by comparison, charges City Light $22 per megawatt hour. City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power delivered immediately. And prices for short-term deals can be higher depending on the time of day. The city has only a long-term contract with the BPA. Despite the record-setting month, city officials hope they'll be in better shape before the year is out. Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct. 1 Seattle's ""energy independence day"" because that's when the city will begin receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA. The historically cheap BPA power, combined with a contract with a gas-fired power plant in Klamath Falls, Ore., should reduce the city's reliance on the open market, city officials say. But the BPA, too, has been stricken by higher market power costs and may have to increase its rates to City Light by 250 percent. The City Council has already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers although it's unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average person. Even at a higher rate, City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good long-term strategy for getting power costs under control. If they succeed, the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded. Until then, local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to Texas. Jim Brunner can be reached at 206-515-5628.

"We have submitted your request for $30 million of UK Power VAR to the Board for approval. I thought about this issue a lot before doing so because I don't feel we are fully in control of the infrastructure there and a large limit can add to the danger. My understanding is that there is an IT and backoffice effort underway to improve this situation and it needs to have focus to complete.

The policy gives us 30 days from the date of the bankruptcy to give notice of the claim.  The deadline is May 6, 2001.  It is not anticipated that any claim will mitigate any income loss as the portfolio credit reserve will increase by a similar amount to our claim.  All benefits from the insurance have already been recognized from previous releases from the portfolio credit reserve.  All recoveries in bankruptcy will passed to the insurance underwriters if we decide to make the claim.

" Bill-I asked Joe to put this together. fyi, Rick. Fwd to Molly  -----Original Message----- From:  Deffner, Joseph   Sent: Tuesday, May 01, 2001 9:33 AM To: Buy, Rick Subject: Contract Requirements for Monetization  Rick, here are a number of the items I look for in the contract while evaluating whether it is a candidate for monetization. Many of these characteristics will be in the contract by definition but a number of these items can tend to be inconsistent across contracts. For maximum funding efficiency, the more homogenous the pool, the better.  1. Clear events of default and prescribed remedies. 2. Clear definition of termination events and process to terminate. 3. Clear liquidated damages provisions upon termination. 4. Firm quantity - take or pay type. We can monetize a requirements contract but will receive a haircut on the value of the deal. 5. Demand charges/index premium contracts easier to monetize. Fixed price contracts require liquid hedging points to lock in the monetizable value. 6. Clear definition of force majeure and permitted duration before contract either continues with LDs or terminates due to frustration. 7. Availability of Business Interruption Insurance to cover losses during a FM event. 8. Regulatory Outs Provisions - Prefer none. 9. Severability clearly defined within the contract. 10. Firm tenor - lenders lack of appetite for a term contract with annual evergreen provisions. If they are not legally obligated, little if any value. 11. Volumetric Take Requirements - Are there make-up provisions for volumes paid for but not taken. If the counterparty didn't purchase the annual minimum, is there an immediate LD payment or does the party have three months for instance to make-up the deficiency. 12. Ability to assign the receivables for financing purposes. Even better if we can assign the contract itself as security. 13. Who is the credit? Is there credit support? Is it capped? 14. Netting provisions. Prefer to have no netting or right of set-off to isolate the payment stream from the Enron estate. Typically, not possible and Enron has to indemnify for set-off claims. 15. Prepayment provisions - Does the counterparty have the right to unilaterally early terminate? Monetization may incur make-whole damages upon a prepayment. Can we pass this cost through as a ""break"" cost of early unwind.  This is my quick cheat sheet of items I screen for. I've asked a few others to give me their thoughts as well and will append to the list.

Some of the specific items that we're focused on as a result of your feedba= ck, and that will be communicated in coming weeks include: improvements to the PRC process which are in the final stages of developmen= t with the business units, recruiting goals and strategies for the 2001 recruiting season, a series of floor meetings beginning today to visit informally with partici= pants in the Program, an updated social schedule that places a priority on interaction among Anal= ysts and Associates, as well as with the business leaders of Enron.  I'm excited that Traci Warner and Ted Bland have joined our team in the Wes= tern Hemisphere to lead Recruiting and Career Development respectively.  To= gether, they bring almost 20 years of Enron business unit experience, and i= n the case of Traci - experience as an Associate in the Program.

"Ted, my comments are indicated below.   -----Original Message----- From:  Murphy, Ted   Sent: Monday, May 14, 2001 9:19 AM To: Buy, Rick Subject: RE: London Assignment  Rick, Amongst my concerns are:  The budget calls for 54 heads to do the job in EEL-RAC. There are currently 31 with 3 offers on the table on 5/14.  There was absolutely no on going recruiting effort here, therefore I have to start from scratch.  The heads that are here are junior at best with little or no Enron or management experience.  There is such a dearth of senior people here that there are almost no people to screen resumes or interview candidates  There is no understanding of the role of RAC in Enron Europe. [Buy, Rick]   Agree, you are supposed to fix all of the above!  The IT platform and operational problems put the risk management activities of our group back 3 years at least. [Buy, Rick]  Agree this is an issue.   The Houston based RAC group (primarily credit) is provincial, uncooperative and boring. [Buy, Rick]  At least they are in their seats working. Maybe you should send Rod back since he is a part of the Houston bore core. You have failed to build consensus in your credit initiative. Without buy-in it is almost impossible to implement change at Enron  In addition to losing net 9 bodies here, the Market Risk group in Houston lost 4 and is poised to lose several more because of     disappointment  with the opportunity set within RAC. [Buy, Rick]  I find it curious that our primary problem with turnover is in Houston Market Risk and London. Linkage?? If people aren't satisfied for the right reasons, they should leave. There is all kind of opportunity in RAC. People are going all over the world and doing different things. We have people in Portland, Sydney, Calgary, London. People have left the group and done well as well. We offer lifetime career satisfaction guarantees to no one.   We are uncompetitive with respect to all-in compensation, title, and resources to do the job as evidenced by an inability to recruit good talent. [Buy, Rick]  Disagree. We did an extensive study last year and adjusted everyone that needed adjustment. It is difficult to recruit. It is one of the hardest things to do in management. It requires salesmanship, good timing and closing ability, especially when a group is in turmoil.  I can rebuild this group but it is going to take longer than anyone thought because of poor previous management.  Finally, I am trouble finding my own motivation.  I believe that I continue to do a good job for the firm yet I do not feel that I am recognized for the effort. [Buy, Rick]  Memos, and other ill thought out outbursts like this are precisely why you are not recognized.  This painful rebuilding process does nothing to make me smarter, more valuable or more interesting excep through a fairly monumental physical    and emotional effort on my part.  [Buy, Rick]  I would look at it as an opportunity to turn around a segment of the company that needs help which is precisely why you were sent to London. I don't particularly care what it does for Ted Murphy.  In  summary here, unless you had just a really bad day, you oght to consider an alternative assignment either in Enron or outside. You were sent to London to fix a problem the organization has. You are lucky in that there is agreement that there is a problem and resources are available ($) to fix them. This is not unlike Joe Gold taking over metals, or Delaney taking over EES. Big mess, needs fixing. People that do this are usually recognized.  [Buy, Rick]  You may want to discuss this tomorrow.   I'm fairly open.

"As with muni bonds, it is nice to be able to just raise taxes to cover your costs. (Unless you are the taxpayer). Tx for update, Rick   -----Original Message----- From:  Ngo, Tracy   Sent: Tuesday, May 15, 2001 10:48 AM To: Buy, Rick Subject: RE: City of Palo Alto - credit reserve  Rick,  The muni's in CA have had the ability to purchase power out in the market since they never signed on to CA's deregulation plan in '98.  Initially, the rating agencies were bullish on the IOU's and bearish on the munis assuming that the munis would not get the benefit of recovering stranded costs in a timely manner.  However, as we've seen lately with all of the turmoil in CA, their perspectives have changed.  Also, Palo Alto's affluent customer base is 1/3 local and 2/3 commuters and is mainly comprised of schools including Stanford University and the Palo Alto School District.  Palo Alto in fact has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Santa Clara County.  We are basing our credit terms in all of the trading contracts to reflect the following:  -that we can only go to the proprietary 'enterprise' funds s.a. electric, gas and water funds for recourse and NOT the general fund -the debt covenants tied to the utility revenue bonds reflect the net revenue pledge allocation of those enterprise funds to service the annual DS -Palo Alto overall has minimal debt levels and the fact that the majority of the assets in the funds are comprised of rate stabilization fund reserves -inclusion of Palo Alto's ability to raise rates sufficient to cover operating costs and annual DS as a MAC (I truly value this covenant) -tiered margining lines based on S&P and Moody's ratings  Hope that helps.

Rick   -----Original Message----- From:  Crews, David   Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 8:25 AM To: Buy, Rick Cc: David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ENRON Subject: RE: FYI - Project Raven  I spoke briefly yesterday with Brad Richter who was going to put something more formal together.  I will send that to you when I have it.  Jeff and the commercial team had different opinions about the managed hosting side of the business.  Part of EBS liked the technical capabilitiy of PSI Net and felt that this capability would allow EBS to run a managed hosting business (basically outsourcing the operation of company web sites).  Jeff did not like this business and had told EBS last week to not put any growth on this part of the business in their analysis.    Without growth on the managed hosting part of the business, EBS needed to find $100 million/year of benefit through the acquisition.  A large part of this would have come from IP Transit which, due to its size, PSI Net would have received free through peering and which EBS currently pays for.  These saving depend a lot on hockey stick projections from EBS' current activities (although MSN would provide a large portion of this savings).  The rest of the benefit was to come through cross selling PSI Net's existing customers and new customers obtained due to the combination of their technical capability and Enron's financial capability.  This increased technical capability is diametrically opposed to Project Reset (the sale of EBS' long haul network to Qwest in return for a series of options on capacity).  PSI Net wanted a quick decision and a purchase of the whole company through a packaged bankruptcy to try and maintain staff and customers.  I have heard comments that they wanted Enron to purchase their consulting arm as well.  This group had approximately 1,000 people and held no particular interest to EBS.  I do not know whether it was the speed of the transaction, the consulting arm, the managed hosting business, or the increased technical direction that killed the transaction.

This was the EBS' structuring teams introduction as well.   The model that Lehman had prepared only looked at the Managed Hosting business and had a number of questionable assumptions that were pointed out to the corporate development team.

Rick   -----Original Message----- From:  Crews, David   Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 8:25 AM To: Buy, Rick Cc: David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ENRON Subject: RE: FYI - Project Raven  I spoke briefly yesterday with Brad Richter who was going to put something more formal together.  I will send that to you when I have it.  Jeff and the commercial team had different opinions about the managed hosting side of the business.  Part of EBS liked the technical capabilitiy of PSI Net and felt that this capability would allow EBS to run a managed hosting business (basically outsourcing the operation of company web sites).  Jeff did not like this business and had told EBS last week to not put any growth on this part of the business in their analysis.    Without growth on the managed hosting part of the business, EBS needed to find $100 million/year of benefit through the acquisition.  A large part of this would have come from IP Transit which, due to its size, PSI Net would have received free through peering and which EBS currently pays for.  These saving depend a lot on hockey stick projections from EBS' current activities (although MSN would provide a large portion of this savings).  The rest of the benefit was to come through cross selling PSI Net's existing customers and new customers obtained due to the combination of their technical capability and Enron's financial capability.  This increased technical capability is diametrically opposed to Project Reset (the sale of EBS' long haul network to Qwest in return for a series of options on capacity).  PSI Net wanted a quick decision and a purchase of the whole company through a packaged bankruptcy to try and maintain staff and customers.  I have heard comments that they wanted Enron to purchase their consulting arm as well.  This group had approximately 1,000 people and held no particular interest to EBS.  I do not know whether it was the speed of the transaction, the consulting arm, the managed hosting business, or the increased technical direction that killed the transaction.

"thanks for heads up. i will let you know how meeting goes. rick   -----Original Message----- From:  Suttle, John   Sent: Sunday, May 27, 2001 8:25 PM To: Buy, Rick Cc: Ted Murphy@ECT; Bradford, William S.; Port, David Subject: Enron Japan - Joe Hirl visit  Rick -   Joe Hirl is scheduled to visit the Houston office this week and I think he is trying to schedule a meeting with you.  Bill Bradford mentioned that I might want to bring you up to speed on some of the recent developments in that office. Though much of the background information is probably old news for you, there are some issues that might come up in your meeting.  As you know, Enron Japan has made the move from Power to Global Markets.  To date, Enron Japan has not submitted proposals for new  VaR limits or products, but I believe their meetings with the Houston management this week are to determine such.  I think by the end of the week, they will have a better idea of what exactly they will trade, what limits they will want trade under, the systems they will need to implement, etc.    Last week, the commercial team discussed with me the possibilities of trading petrochemicals through  a new exchange - The Tokyo Commodities Exchange.  To jumpstart the Global Markets business, the team intends to be quite active on the exchange, trading Gasoline and Kerosene.  From a Credit perspective, we need to get a better idea of how transactions in the exchange will be managed.  The exchange is unusual in that there is not a clearinghouse.  Rather, any order we post will be matched to a specific counterparty, which could be any of 80 or so ""Broker Members"".  Credit risk is somewhat mitigated in that each counterparty in every trade must post an initial margin amount to be held and used to reduce default risk.  However, as far as I can tell, there will be no incremental margin call when exposure increases beyond the initial margin amount.  This has the potential of opening Enron to significant counterparty risk with counterparties with whom we might not necessarily be comfortable.  The information packet I received does vaguely discuss a ""Protection Fund"" that might mitigate default risk.  I will follow-up on this issue, but for now, protection is unclear.  From a market risk perspective, I will make sure the team has the appropriate approvals in place for VaR limits and products to be traded prior to transacting.  I will also make sure the right systems are in place to capture transactions, volumes, etc. - and have these aggregate into the daily RiskTrac reports.  From an Underwriting perspective, there seems to be one transaction that is worth mentioning (others are still in preliminary stages).  Jeremy Thirsk is working on a large ($40-50MM) Methanol prepay agreement with Nissho Iwai - a struggling Japanese counterparty.  Though the DASH is still being drafted, it is worth noting that this transaction not only carries significant counterparty credit risk, but the methanol purchases will take place in Indonesia  - adding operating and country risks into the equation.  Jeremy and I discussed various actions we could take to mitigate risks  - taking liens on assets, credit default swaps, insurance, and corporate supply obligation agreements.   I have not heard back from Jeremy this week, but thought you might need to know this is out there in case it comes up in your meeting with Hirl.   The commercial team in the process of shifting gears right now, and I am not sure how long it will take for them to have things in order enough to transact.  I will keep everyone posted on their progress. Please let me know if you would like to see anything in further detail.

As of today, we show that NewPower's exposure stands at approximately $66MM now that May business has rolled off.  Of course, we do have your $20MM cash collateral and the $15MM collateral threshold, but that still leaves us about $31MM short.  I have looked and it appears that approximately $14MM of the exposure is related to June Gas Sales to NewPower.

This action is a direct result of the continuing power crisis in California and the threat of a backlash which could lead to re-regulation of the energy industry in California, which could in turn hurt the long-term value of CalPERS' energy holdings.  CalPERS owns 2.6 million shares of Enron - less that 1/10th of 1% of the total value of CalPERS' assets and 6.2% of their total energy holdings.   As a result of these actions, Enron and CalPERS halted their negotiations of the amendments to the JEDI II Partnership Agreement which would have expanded the investment opportunities available to JEDI II and thus funds available to various Enron business units (i.e. EBS).  Instead the partners agreed to a one year extension of the commitment period for Capital Contributions (limited to $100 million) under current Partnership Agreement terms and concurrently called a Suspension Event effective June 29, 2001.  What does this mean?  A Suspension Event prohibits any new investments being made by the JEDI II Partnership until the Suspension Event period is lifted.  We are uncertain at this point when that might be.    I have attached below some press releases related to the issue.  If you have any questions or concerns please give me a call.

My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.  These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.  I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses.  Thanks!  John Sherriff   (Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)  We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.  In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect:  Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.  John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered.  Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.  Please communicate this policy to your staff.

This should be completed early next week and either your group or Steve will get it circulated for sign-offs.  2) We (Detmering/Sherrick) will review the project with Skilling/Lay prior to Rac sign-off.

Hope you continue to make progress without too much pain.  Don't talk unless you have to.  Could you imagine if I ever have that operation, there'd be blood everywhere!  I do not have anything in particular that would compel me to make you talk.  It is good to hear that you will be back in the office, because I am concerned that the Board stuff needs direction.  Not that people aren't working on stuff, but your perspective is needed.  We had what I think was an excellent meeting with Jeff Skilling - I chimed in by conference call.  He spent about an hour and 1/2 with David, Cassandra and me.  Had some interesting perspectives.  He did make the comment that, if he could get the same returns on incremental VaR, he would rather increase our limit to $250MM than do more of those asset deals!!  Things are generally the same around here, there are some deals, but none that would require you to step in.    Michael is trying to push to get some things closed in July because he is concerned that August will be dead.  It looks very likely that we are trying to dress up Encom for sale without making big commitments.  There have been a few problems that may come across your radar scope - there were some personell issues in the Henry Bath warehousing business that have been dealt with and some personell changes in metals, basically a few people let go in NY and London and a re-configuration of the commercial staff - merging of physical and financial. It seems to be moving on the right track from a control perspective.  It remains to be seen on the commercial front.  EBS has gotten gutted here.  I have spoken to Steve.  Apparently, he is going back soon, but he is in the fortunate state of having a few decent offers to weigh internally. He hasn't told me his final decision.  We have lost a 2 more people to resignation on the credit side - Anna Reich and Karolina Moran.  I would have liked to have kept Karolina but she has been here 2 years and seems a little too bitter from the management changes and the lack of substantive change to refresh herself.  Anna was going to have to be replaced anyway. On the positive side of the ledger, an ex-JP morgan ISDA Collateral Annex expert - Christine Stanchus - has joined yesterday, Pat Cini has been doing a good job, Rudi Z. plans to start on 8/15, Tracy Ngo is here looking around and thinking about early september, 3 from the outside have accepted and we have 4/5 other real prospects. There are also a few other internal transfers (one which we ought to discuss). We have reviewed hundreds of resumes, spoken to tons of agencies, put in 2 newpaper adds and interviewed maybe a hundred people.  Finally, we are starting to see some reasonable quality - a little more expensive, but much better.  Most hires/offers have been in the middle range - sr. Specialist - junior director.  We need to fill in the other ends of the spectrum.  It is possible that we have turned the corner....  I am hoping that when the days begin to get shorter (September 5th?), I will be in a position to actually start to make an impact around here.

These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the ""Review Team"" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the ""Resource Group"" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:   <http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp>   If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP Personal ID number.

Subject: MidWest Gas Storage and other such assets/interests  Rick Carson from RAC is currently reviewing all of the interests/assets we have which have been written to zero over the last few years and have essentially disappeared from any form of reporting - a prime example of these would be MidWest Gas Storage which recently emerged as something of an issue.  Rick believes that there are approximately 75 - 100 of these interests/assets for review and he is preparing a list in the next week or so.  When this list is pulled together reponsibility for all of them will fall under Dick Lydecker, this will therefore include Mid West Gas Storage.  Let's hope Dick can get something from our 25% overriding interest.  Dick will be responsible for reviewing this portfolio, managing the risks and ensuring we maximise all upsides.

Enron University Affairs, the Xcelerator and the Recruiting department are collaborating with the McIntire School of Commerce (University of Virginia) on a year long project where 80 Commerce students will research a topic assigned to them by Enron.  At this point, the Xcelerator has suggested research on the 'Decentralization of Energy Distribution/Distributive Generation', and to this end, we are responding to faculty requests for broad-based industry and Enron-specific information.  Bob Kemp, Associate Dean for the Graduate Programs has requested any type of capital budgeting information that we could provide to help the students 'get a better feel for' how Enron structures its deals.    I am by no means a financial guru or whiz, so I'm not sure any of this will make sense to you but here are the buzz words he mentioned during a conference call:  cash flows $ required needed cost of capital time adjustments (for capital)  Is there anything else we can give them (outside of a dummy DASH)?

"Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign focuses on making a difference to people severely impacted by the recent flood ""Allison"".  All business units and Corporate functions will be participating in a Day of Caring, teaming with the following United Way agencies: Jewish Community Center, YMCA, Neighborhood Centers, and Center for the Retarded.  The Corporate functions and EGAS employees' Day of Caring is on Wednesday, August 8, 2001, and we will be teaming with the Jewish Community Center to provide assistance to senior citizen meals-on-wheels beneficiaries.  Activities that will be completed that day include painting, yard work, landscaping, cleaning, and various home repairs.  The Jewish Community Center provides community services to individuals regardless of religious orientation.  These services include: childcare, youth development, summer day camp, meals-on-wheels and congregate meals to the elderly, health and recreation programs, dance, drama and music programs, refugee services and other community services.  The Jewish Community Center is responsible for providing approximately 40% of Houston/Harris County meals-on-wheels per day.  Funding comes from a combination of federal and state programs, the United Way and individuals.  I encourage every single employee  to take at least half of your day on August 8th to participate in this effort.  RAC's goal is 100% participation.  It is a unique opportunity to truly make a difference in someone's quality of life, and you will be able to see first hand how your United Way contributions improve the lives of people in our own community.    Below are our United Way contacts within each group that will be helping with this process and can answer any questions.  Please sign up with your team leader by designating whether you are interested in participating for a full day, or for which half of the day, and they will review with each function's department head to ensure appropriate RAC coverage for that day's responsibilities.    Thank you in advance for volunteering your time.  Let's show everyone that RAC is dedicated to helping those that are less fortunate.  Rick   Enron Corp.

"As you are now aware, the United Way Campaign has now kicked-off and RAC is very much an important part of the efforts and activities that have been and will be taking place.  First of all, Monday morning, each of you should have received a small package of Lego building blocks and a schedule of United Way activities for the week.  The building blocks symbolize Enron's commitment to ""Building Houston's Future"" with the United Way and the schedule outlines the coming activities that Enron employees will be engaging in to show support for the United Way Agencies and the Houston community.  To highlight this week's activities:  On Wednesday, August 8, many of our RAC colleagues will be participating in the 2001 Enron Days of Caring.  The Enron Corporate Team, of which RAC is a large and important part, will be providing assistance to the Jewish Community Center.  If you have already volunteered to play a role in this activity--thank you.  If you have not had an opportunity to volunteer and would like to, please contact any one of this year's RAC United Way Campaign Coordinators--Cindy Hudler, Rebecca Phillips, Darren Vanek, Shelli Smith, Becky Caudle, Cassandra Schultz or Chip Schneider.  On Friday, August 10, Enron will host an Appreciation Event in Antioch Park which will include a complimentary lunch from Chick-Fil-A and activities to celebrate Enron employee efforts during the week.  Included in this event will be the Building Block Challenge contest featuring managers from around Enron including Dave Gorte and Chip Schneider on the Corporate Team.  Please plan on coming out to join-in the celebration and support our colleagues.  Of course, underlying all of the planned activities is the financial need that the Houston area United Way Agencies have for the Year 2002.  This year has been extraordinary due to the flooding and devastation experienced by the Houston area during Tropical Storm Alison.  In addition to providing their typical day-to-day community services, many United Way Agencies played a crucial role in the recovery effort and still provide support to those affected by the storm.  A contribution to the United Way this year is as important as ever given the extraordinary need.  Remember approximately $0.90 out of every $1.00 go directly to benefit our friends, neighbors and fellow citizens in the Houston area.  I sincerely encourage you to support RAC's objective of 100% participation in this aspect of the Campaign by making a contribution.  Contributions can be made by clicking on the Enron Human Resources website at https://hrglobal.enron.com.  Thanks for your support.

"Rick, There are very few single issues that require urgent consultation with you, however there are lots of little things that you may want to be aware of:  We had an FSA 'Traded Risk' 2-day audit the past two days.  The operations/risk group bore the brunt of the work but Michael Pitt and I spent some time with them as well and we did do some level of preparation.  Jonathon Marsh, our compliance guy, seeemed very pleased with the result.  You never get away clean, but I think that they were impressed with the effort as well as the Enron risk culture.  by the way, my opinion of both Jonathan Marsh and Paul Freeman, the new technology guy is quite high - they are both good guys who want to make positive changes and not afraid to say whats on their mind.  2 risk policy issues came up - one regarding credit trading and the other regarding the freight book wanting to lay off credit risk with the credit book. these we are slated to discuss with you tomorrow.  There are 2 new bad credits in Metals - 1 related to McCook where two of the 3 companies in the group declared ch 11 - we are owed est. $7.5MM   the other co. is the one that has granted us a free gigantic option on tolling ally for power - the commercial team is attempting to work out a situation   where we transfer the unsecured claims to the ch 11 entities to a first security package on the smelter in co 3.   The other bad deal is a lead company out ogf the NY office where they owe us $450K on financials and we owe them $1MM on physicals - we are working on netting the positions  There are a number of deals being worked on surrounding TPL ppa's in which the power positions would be taken on by Enron and we would get cash to either extinguish or re-mark the price (the purchases are way out of the money).  There are 3 in the negotiation process - each big - not at the decision or DASH stage.  we had a DASH signed off while I was away on ETOL for a gas turbine in which we get tolling in exchange for a capacity payment.  I assume you are up to speed on the tragedy at TPL yesterday.  Norway is looking at 2 large power prepays with municipal generators - low probability  we will be circulating a DASH on $2MM more into Thrace - turkish e&p and pipeline play - total exp =$7.25MM  team worked extensively with Jim ledlow and Brad on the analysis.  deal looks fine on the surface - 46% iirr vs 35% capital price.  only real issue is 'do we want to sink more $ into Turkey in order to improve the chances of a good sale or do we just put progress on hold'  good news is that $1.5mm is coming from cash flow from the project.  We have in the works one of the few EES NA-type deals with Guiness at a single facility.  $9mm in capital.  in the markets, we do not seem to be doing particularly well of late - Norway is down, uk gas has gotten caught in a short squeeze, uk power has lost a little, metals is metals .... things are moving on the personell front as well: Rudi starts monday Mike Mumford (internal transfer from Enron Credit) start 9/3 Tracy comes in mid September Blair van Zant -Director credit starts on 9/30 Shane Miller -m specialist mrm started yestdy Erik beekman - specialist mrm starts early sep Joachim von Geilieu - director credit is weighing an offer John Collenette - sr director - credit has resigned his job/accepted our offer with 11/5 outside start date Michel Gantois - director -credit/underwriting has accetped and will start in houston soon and relocate to london no later than 12/01 we have several quite interesting junior candidates for credit which we will decide on within a week there are 2 strong candidates for a sr dir role  and we have seen several other interesting candidates and we have a few other internal folks who are interested I have agreed to let Paul Freeman have Michael Pitt to continue his good work on project Salem - it will be good to have a friendly in their territory. it also frees up a budget spot.

"Rick  1 Limits. Here's how I interpreted the BOD approvals:  The BOD approved an aggregate of $150MM, with $50MM of discretionary VaR, plus the new policy which doesn't recognise the concept of discretionary VaR. So here's what I did:  Effectively I allocated all the $50MM of discretionary such that Pug's ""Big Buckets"" are now as follows:  US Gas    $100MM US Elec    $100MM Europe Gas & Elec   $35MM Global Products   $20MM Financials    $15MM Emerging Businesses  $20MM  If you have a calculator handy you'll see that this aggregates to $149.164MM (assuming zero correlation).   At Business Unit level the individual commodity limits are unchanged, and I have put limits over the Business Units themselves as follows:  Enron Americas    $82MM EWS OOC (aka George Martingale) $3MM  EEL     $34MM EGM     $23MM EIM     $8MM EBS     $4MM PGE     $4MM ETS     $1MM  Again I used root-sum-of-squares, and remember the original commodity limits (by VaR, net open and mat gap) are still in place (e.g. gas = $61MM as before). So that keeps it screwed down pretty tight and preserves the discretion between the ""Big Buckets"" and the Business Units.  I spoke to Rebecca C who could only remember the decision outlined above, but offered to call Pug and let him know. I said I would come back on that. I think we should do that ourselves, possibly with Lay in the loop (?).  Cleared it with Whalley today (he laughed), mentioned the dwindling membership of the Risk Management Committee and said ""In my current role I think I should be asking for limits, not approving them""  ...and then...  2 The gas desk lost $98MM yesterday  A combination of a very bullish AGA number (3 Bcf injection - not a typo - three Bcf !) plus some hurricane activity in the gulf sent prices up by between 25 and 30c all across the strip. The long and the short of it was we are long Nov - Jan but short (big-time) out beyond that - the rest is arithmetic.  So we have two flavors of P&L notification, one at the business unit level (Americas) $89MM loss against VaR limit of $82MM; the other as a commodity, losing $126MM (the desk aren't the only ones with a gas position, as usual) against the Big Bucket number of $100MM. Total trading was a loss of $106MM against a VaR limit of $150MM so no calls to Pug required (thank goodness).

Rick  -----Original Message-----  From: Port, David  Sent: Mon 8/20/2001 2:07 PM  To: Buy, Rick  Cc:  Subject: Pug's Fax    Here are my thoughts on some of Pug's comments (Karen has faxed the memo from Pug I believe):   1       Roles of Audit and Finance Committees   I agree with the distinction he draws and I don't see why the entire Board should not see risk/return information.  We can tweak the policy to bring this to the fore.  2       Post-Audit   I'll talk to Gorte   3       Capital Allocation   Complex. Charges for risk capital would not be as difficult as allocating funding. Building balance sheets is key.   4       Trading Limits   In my last tome I have effectively limited the use of D-VaR to the levels specified by the concentration buckets, so I think we have satisfied that concern.   With position limits I would argue that ones needs them where VaR does not ""callibrate"" well, for example with Steel trading where there is no observable options market, you need more metrics to tell you about the risk. Conversely in US Gas I think the market is fairly deep and the VaR tells us much about the risk. Also, in a similar fashion to ""model approval"" under Basle Capital Adequacy rules, the quality of the risk administration process and other controls could make us more comfortable about just using VaR.  5       Reporting   Policy Section 4.1.2.3.1 talks about violations and notifications. He is asking should he not be called for a five day loss (c) and an ETL excess (d), in addition to the usual corporate VaR breach and one day loss > VaR. I think the five day loss actually would warrant a Pug call because under the new method (5 day loss > 225% of VaR), the number could be very large (but also less likely). For ETL I would advise against having a Pug call on this since we still need to get the metric bedded down properly (and all the usual arguments about the math played out).  The phrase ""at their discretion"" to which he refers means that the Risk Committee can tell who they like about violations, as they deem necessary - so its just built-in flexibility.  6       Liquidity   We are cranking this right now.   Other news   Gas off approximately 15c across the strip today - Friday was quiet.  George has made $9m over the last 5 days as crude has come off 50 - 60c  ENE is $36 (horrible)   DP    ",rick.buy@enron.com,david.port@enron.com,RE: Pug's Fax,2001-08-20 15:17:32-07:00,received

Looking forward we have several new people coming on board in the next few months and I have outlined their provisional start dates below:  Credit  John Collenette (Snr Director) - 5 November  Mike Mumford (Director) - 3 September  Blair Van Zant (Director) - 1 October  Tracy Ngo (Director) - September  Simon Hockenhull (Snr Specialist) - 2 September  Adam Bauer (Specialist) - 27 August (Sydney office initially)  Shane Forster (Sr.Specialist) - 24 September   Market Risk  Michel Gantois (Director) - December/January  Erik Beekman (Specialist) - 17 September   Underwriting  Christian Pearce (Associate) - 10 September   I realize that, in addition to increasing our capacity,  new starters also require a fair amount of indoctrination/training.   Many members of our team as well as RAC-Houston and much of EEL have put a large amount of time and effort in the selection of these people, all with the consideration of adding people that will fit in and provide some level of unique experience/insight.  We believe that these new starters will provide an excellent complement to our existing skill sets.  Please do your best to welcome these new people, take advantage of their capabilities as well as give them the benefit of your knowledge and experience.  Hopefully these additions will allow us to effect an intellectual capital transfer that benefits us all and makes this a better place to work in all respects.

"Rick,  Olivier's request for clarification is consistent with what we have discussed in the past (although constrained, but pre-approved, limits for ""yellow"" countries [shown in black in the attached] probably make sense), but I want to ensure that you continue to concur with this approach based upon our most recent list of green/yellow/red countries.

Recent quieries have focused particularly on power deals in the Balkans (Bosnia, Macedonia, etc.) and metal deals in countries ranging from Uzbekistan to Vietnam.  In order to give them the kind of guidelines they need, I would like to be able to use the recently prepared table of conforming/not recommended/non conforming countries. My proposal would be to essentially tell them that:  (1) No business can be done in a non-conforming country unless explicitly authorized by the ENE Office of the Chairman.   (2) No business can be done in a not-recommended country unless explicitly authorized by RAC.  (3) Both authorizations should be based on:    (i) a country assessment by RAC and other relevant teams (Legal for example);    (ii) an explanation by the traders/originators of the strategic importance of doing business there and of their future plans (expected type of business and   volume); and    (iii) a list of requirements prepared by RAC setting out:   - the type of business that we think we could do in that country;   - the extent of due diligence required before closing deals (background checks, legal opinion, etc.);   - the required mitigants (insurance, etc.); and, possibly  - a maximum aggregate exposure to the country.   (4) The country approval would obviously not replace the normal RAC requirements on specific deals.  I would be grateful if you could please let me have your comments on this.  If this is something you can live with, we will need to make sure that: (i) the list is finalized asap; (ii) we get a clear picture of what our current country exposure is (I have already asked metals to provide this to us); and (iii) we communicate all this to the teams.

"Rick,  I have spent some time reviewing the allocation of PGE's VaR and net open position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to better match the limits and their objectives to PGE's trading activity and portfolio.  I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal.  I have also reviewed them with Vlady .  1.  VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period. After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio.  2. NOP:  After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently PGE has been using a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR I've recalculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.  If you agree with these changes please let me know.  If you have any questions please contact me at (503) 464-2723.  Thanks.

"Rick - further to our discussion, here is the change Enron Americas are requesting in their limit structure:  Eliminate volumetric limits on net open position and maturity gap; Eliminate limits on individual commodities within the business unit; Replace with one limit, expressed in VaR, for the entire business unit, of $100MM.  I am not uncomfortable with $100MM, given the opportunity set and the required returns from this activity. ETL at this level could be in the region of $340MM.  I think the other things to consider in making the decision are as follows:  Does the VaR tell us sufficient about the risk ?  I think it does since we have the ability to see components of it in some detail and it backtests well  Tail Risks  Generally we have the most data on tail risks for US gas and power and we are most confident about the EVaR and ETL measures for these commodities.  Liquidity  This should be a key point in removing volumetric limits because they give us a concept of size. Our recent analysis has shown that our ability to unload risk in US natural gas certainly is high (50% reduction, 10 days) - but we need to continually revisit this analysis.  Administration of Risk  Generally I think we are comfortable - deal capture is good since so many trades are picked up through EOL. Delegation of authority using VaR limits at desk level is strong   But since VaR is so dependent on MTM values and curves I would still recommend a review of:  curve validation results; ageing of confirmations outstanding (in and out); flash to actual differences (if any)  Compliance with Policy  The policy requires limits under the business unit by ""commodity groups"" in some combination of volumetric and VaR limits. We also must approve products/commodities for a business unit.  One interpretation of this is to define the commodity ""group"" as the aggregate of gas, power, coal, crude, and approve those products, in which case the aggregate limit for the business unit is the commdity group limit also - so we can have one limit.   Our concern about the Firm blowing up because everyone is short crude, for example, is covered by the fact that we can still see all the components of our aggregate risk to a single commodity, which is also capped by the concentration limits. The only question is from a governance standpoint, how you prevent yourself bumping up against those and having to explain it to the board.  Another side of this argument is the ""10K analogy"" - if I put $100MM into my 10K via a mutual fund I am likely to want them to declare in which markets they invest it.  To summarize, I think we could justify losing volumetric limits for this business. On the question of level of risk and commodity limits, I think we should talk it over with Greg / Ken.

Just to give you a sense Profit wise this has not shaped up to be a good quarter - we will be scrambling for some pretty big numbers in order to make the quarter - likely candidates are: a look at the major curves (price and volatility) in UK power deals with the major offtakers of TPL - British Energy, London Electricity.... a couple of portfolio deals in enroncredit a significant alumina/aluminum swap with China National Container - I believe we have boxed the credit risk reasonably well. what else?? I'll keep you posted.  Continue to see a ramp up in activity and requirements for coal and global products I have talked to the new origination team working for Randy Maffet here and they are looking at some big and complex deals a al GAF Haven't heard anything on project Nero (public EIM deal)  since I left you that message. Lots of activity on the Continent particulary with EdF auctioning capacity New deal in EBS - $4.3MM dollars in capacity payments - bad credit NEOS EWZ joint venture looks likely to be signed.   The inflow of humans is starting - 2 new people monday, 2 more on the 17th, couple more before month end. Sr. Director for Metals/Global mkts starts 10-15 have verbal offer acceptance from Sr. Director/Credit with focus on UK just recieved - probably a nov start.  We had an all-RAC EEL meeting with Michael Brown which seems well recieved. Also did an initial cut of a 'risk review' of Enron Credit with Michael that went well.  Plan to do with you next week.

I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal.  I have also reviewed them with Vlady .   1.  VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period. After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio.   2.

Rick, as you and I discussed in our meeting on August 9, we have spent many months documenting discrepancies between source systems (ERMS, Enpower, etc.) and RisktRAC, and the implications for V@R calculations and Credit Aggregation.  The process of a daily meeting and a tracking tool for discrepancies helped to identify true operational process issues that have been addressed.  As we discussed, our daily tracking has now for months documented evidence pointing to the true underlying issue-- that the linkage of information between source systems and RisktRAC is not smooth and reliable, and has never been appropriately addressed for its completeness, accuracy and efficiency.  I applaud the IT team who delivered the analytical tools that are valuable in RisktRAC.  Now it is time to align business rules employed across source systems, V@R calculations and CreditAg and to partner the IT resources from source systems and RisktRAC to solve the underlying problem.    In my meeting with Rick Buy, I volunteered to take ownership of fixing the problem, obviously with much help from the operations teams, IT resources and Rick's designated RAC stakeholder, Debbie Brackett.  Our focus on this project is global, and will be threefold, assuring that agreements on business rules and changes in processes or systems  will deliver ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS and EFFICIENCY.  Wanda's summary seems to allude to a daily reconciliation process that will take place,  To clarify, our purpose in this project will be to create systematic checks, control totals and exception reporting so that humans do not have to implement a daily reconciliation process.    Wanda is a little ahead of herself with the 60 to 90 day timeline.  We do not have a firm timeline established yet.  We have designated business and IT resources, and are in the process of discussing with London how they will be involved.  We have had a preliminary meeting with Steve  Stock and he is on board and understands that we must make meaningful progress in a short period of time.  With the exception of London, Steve has the necessary IT resources reporting to him for both RisktRAC and source systems.  Steve is reviewing some diagnostics from his architecture group, and then we will be at the point of delineating milestones and timelines within the next 10 days.  We do anticipate a relatively short timeframe for results on this effort, but that is not yet defined.    We are creating a steering committee and project management office for this project with operations, RAC and IT members that will be appropriate, but not too large.  We want to focus on getting the work done.  I will gladly update all on this distribution list in the next 10 days on  our finalized steering committee, project managers, definition of outcomes from the project and planned completion dates.  We look forward to the opportunity to solve this data discrepancy issue in a definitive way.  --Sally      -----Original Message-----  From:   Curry, Wanda   Sent:   Tuesday, September  4, 2001 10:00 AM  To:     Buy, Rick; Piper, Greg  Cc:     Beck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Wilson, Shona; Victorio, Tom; Murphy, Ted; Bradford, William S.; Port, David  Subject:        Reconciliation Across Risk Applications    Rick and Greg,   I met with Sally and Beth on August 24th to discuss the operational risk management initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applications.  This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from   source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR.    Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.  The scope includes a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process.  They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.  The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days.  We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.         This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available:   1) the ability to track data ""accuracy"" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique ""failures"".  How complete is the data?   2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?)   3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows   4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.

I've asked Rick Buy in the past to create some sort of back-up approvals when we have situations like this come up. This isn't specifically about Corp.

"RICK:       Thanks for your note and staying in touch during a time when a huminatarian crises could easily spiral into something  where the worste news is yet to come.   Here is what Ive found out...       NYMEX has contingencies (which they are yet to exercise) for back-up clearing, as well as a back-up site for open outcry trading.  In the past, the first contingency has been exercised several times and is proven, though the later has never been tested in practice.  Meanwhile, clearinghouse payments have been delayed as a result of the NYMEX closing and the exchange is likely to remain closed through the balance of the week (thus eliminating the need for daily payments).  During this time the exchange is closed, an effort is to be made to trigger one or both of the contingencies above (based on yet to be clarified damage assessments).  The fact that some degree of transaction data integrity exists suggests that long-term payment performance from NYMEX is not likely to be a problem.  However, if clearing payment delays extend past the end of the month when swaps settle, then we may see delayed payments from weaker credits in related swap and physical markets.  In this regard, the markets have breathing room since the terrorist attacks didnt occur late in the month.  Finally, there have been general comments from Treasury and Fed Bank officials to guarantee stock exchange payments, and the assumption is that the same guarantees would apply to the NY commodity exchanges (but this asumption has not been validated or addressed directly in public comments).

"Rick   I spoke with Mr. Causey this morning and moved over here. We have been working with your IT people on security but this is a new practice for us that we are having great success in the energy companies. As we have worked with more companies on the finance side of businesses we have had to eliminate the IT terms so it makes a lot more sense to Risk Managers now.   e-Risk Management starts with a way to manage the risks of e-commerce such that these risks are understood from the technologists to the board room and you can manage it.   Since this is such a new and radically different concept I have found our literature confuses more often than it helps. It has some basic tenants that are straight forward that can be presented and understood but are not easy to write down. It is not a product.   First, we are going to define risk as the potential reduction in assets from the threats of e-commerce. Now, you have more intangible assets than tangible assets so that we have mastered. So this discussion is on the asset management side and is a key concept to understand. Everything else is based on that. Often we get in an income vs. balance sheet discussion. In your case you have $11B in book value and $27B in market value so you have $16B in intangible assets. There are two things to do with these assets 1) protect them as you become e-commerce enabled and 2) figure out how to leverage and grow them with e-business. So this is where we start.    On the protection side e-commerce threats will come two ways. Your largest threats are going to be on transactions, like trading, asset acquisition or payments. Other threats will come from vulnerabilities in your network. So this is both in trading, business strategy and Information technology. That is the e-Risk management side.   On the growth side once we and you allocate these $16B of intangible assets to categories, strategies can be built to grow selected areas. Of course, fixed IT assets have a high need to be leveraged also. Approximately 25% of your IT budget is managing boxes ( fixed assets) that has no competitive value. That is what we are doing at Chevron.   For protection you can throw an infinite amount of technology dollars at the e-commerce security requirement and not eliminate the risk (if you pin your technology people to the wall they will finally admit this). However, once you have e-Risk Management you can manage the costs of technology and risk to what we call ""The Most Favored Case"" investment. Companies have found this e-Risk concept should be completed before a security policy is developed because until you do understand the asset risk you don't know what to write a security policy to do.   Let me know if you need more. Many energy companies, especially the utilities, have added e-Risk to Risk Management. Many recognize e-Risk as the biggest going forward. This is aimed at getting that elevated Risk Management concept under way.   Normally we would like to come in for an introduction meeting ( 1 1/2 hours) to get the basic concepts covered and then talk about what our e-Risk Practice does. We are at Keller Springs and the Tollway in North Dallas if you wanted to come here.   Thanks.

Though many business units have their own tickets for these games, the Corporate Marketing team would like to make the corporate tickets listed below available to the Management Committee on a first come, first serve basis for the 2001 playoff games tentatively scheduled to begin around October 9th.  Enron's Corporate Suite (includes 14 tickets and two parking passes)  Four (4) Diamond Club Level  Four (4) Club Level  Four (4) Dugout Level  Four (4) Field Level    We will be accepting requests for these tickets by game number and by series. (Ex. If you were requesting tickets to Game 2 of the League Championship Series (LCS) you would be asking for tickets to a game that could be played on October 10 or October 13 , per the schedule below, depending if the Astros have home field advantage.)  As in the past, these tickets will be billed to your company number and cost center.      If a game is listed as ""if necessary"" there is no guarantee that this game will be played due to various reasons such as home field advantage and length of series.  If you select one of these games and it is not played, the game will not be able to be replaced with another game.  Tickets for games not played will not be charged to your company number and cost center.

"I think you will find much more demand than you think for engineers, although the economy is suffering at the moment. It does not sound like this lady has her act together. I wish I knew more about biomedical engineers. You should talk to the head of the dept. and ask who is big in the industry and send them all letters with a resume attached. Don't worry at all about your resume right now, it is almost irrelevant. Your grade point average and salutatorian are relevant. There are very few female engineers in the workplace which will help you a lot. You could work for companies like Enron, Exxon, Shell for example but it would not be in your major.

Just wanted to let you know that I went into my undergraduate career services office today (just for the heck of it).  The lady was very helpful but sort of scared me.  At first she was snobby because I hadn't had any experience, but then she realized that I had a lot of skills from my courses that would go on my resume and that I could include my Nantucket work and stuff like that.  No chance of a job in England or Ireland though.  She said it would be too much work for her to start researching foreign companies.  So I guess I'm gonna have to start going to seminars and stuff to get myself ready for job searching.  She's gonna help me with my resume, which I'll proably start on this weekend.  She said summer co-ops are very hard to come by since more kids are looking and companies don't really want people for just the summer.  But she said I'm lucky that I came in so early.!  So who knows.     I also applied for engineering dean's host today.  The application process was easy, and it kind of hurt my pride when I applied for CAS dean's host and didn't get it, so I'll see if this goes any better.  It will just entail a few hours on Fridays in the spring, and I remember that we both found the dean's hosts very helpful when we went to my freshman Friday.  But I may not get it, so oh well.  Rebecca has not woken up yet today.  It is 5:00.  She says she has a headache.  It has been nice and quiet at least.  I returned a textbook today (went and made copies of the pages i needed to save us the 35 bucks).  I accept cash or check.  Life is good and boring.  I have been very productive the past few days, and I am happy the week is coming to an end.  I will try to have some fun this weekend.  OK that's it for now.  HOpe all's well for you.

"I hope this finds you and all your close ones well.  What a crazy world we seem to be in at the moment.  We want to communicate to friends and associates some of our current perspectives.   Pre September 11  We had already been operating under the assumption that our economy has been in a recession for a while.  Although the technical definition of recession may not have been achieved, we can't see much difference between positive 0.2% and negative 0.1% economic growth.  We also thought the trillion dollar plus loss in stock market wealth had to manifest itself into a general economic contraction.  We had not expected to see the trends of growing lay offs and shrinking cash flows to turn around until the third quarter of 2002.  Our perspectives have been more pessimistic than the general market up until September 11.  We believe both expansions and contractions can feed off themselves.  The current contraction seemed to validate this.  We also believe it is usually significant events that provide the catalyst to turning these trends.   Post September 11  The events of September 11 will certainly put us in a technical recession.  Now though, we don't expect to see the cash flow contractions and lay offs draw themselves out for as long a period.  The economic contraction will now be steeper, but with the bottom reached sooner.  In crisis mode, Washington is being very proactive at providing stimulus to the economy.  We don't think this would have been the case outside of a crisis.  A significant event has provided us with the stimulus for renewed growth.  We now believe light at the end of the tunnel may appear in the second quarter of 2002, a modest growth environment to appear in the third quarter of 2002 and possible robust growth by the end of next year.  The hole we fall in will be deeper, but now we have much more of a helping hand from Washington.  The Future  There's a lot we all have to be grateful for at this point in time.  We've all benefited from a very long expansion period.  We've lived during the most amazing time in all of human history.  The social, cultural and technologi cal advances man has made over the last two generations are unparalleled in history.  We live in a great country where freedom and prosperity have only grown since our inception.    Our social consciousness has certainly been violated.  We grieve for all those who are suffering.  We pray for them, for our families and ourselves.   We pray for peace and logic to prevail.    This event provides our country with an opportunity to show the strength of our character.  We have faith that operating under the veil of our great value systems, America's leadership will do the best thing for most all world constituencies.  We will set the best example of fairness, yet resolve.  The seeds of our next great economic growth cycle have now been planted.  It is not our technology, or our wealth, or our military strength that will inspire the world.  It's our value systems that will inspire them.   Underneath all the trappings of American culture and prosperity are the foundations of freedom, opportunity, fairness and justice.  These are the American ""products"" that inspire the world to emulate us.  Over time, the world's desire to be more and more like America will drive even greater demand for everything American.    We wish everyone well with the challenges ahead.  Fear not, as an even more fair and honest world, and an even stronger economic growth environment, are right around the corner.  Doug   Douglas A.

"Rick, I wanted to summarize for you my budget meeting with Michael on Wed.  I will send you the whole pack under separate cover, but here are the highlights:  Relatively speaking, it was constructive - he has made unequivical cut demands of other groups   Original (adjusted) headcount budget for 2001 was 52, he is asking me to freeze heads at current 44       which includes: not replacing recent leaver - Karin Levin        not replacing scheduled Houston rotation - Oliver Harrison        Scheduled new arrrivals - John Collenette, Karl Sees, Blair Van Zant, Adam Bauer, Michel Gantois        Tracy Ngo, plus 5 new in last month.  2002 budget looks much larger than 2001, despite lower headcount due to: $1.6MM increase due to full costing of expats @ salary plus 4x salary (instead of just            salary)           $500k for communications allocated           increase in benefit costs from 10% to 23%  All other expenses lowered -    Budget not finalized. Michael requested: reduce Travel by a significant amount ($100k?)      get more precise justification of allocations from RAC Corp -        Credit - $350k looks a little low (includes you, bill, debbie, credit reserve,CAS..)       Market - $660 looks a little high/ok       UndWr - $499 looks too high       Portfolio - $108 ??      be prepared to shed under 2 scenarios a) 5 heads           b) 10 heads 5 heads can be accomodated with little change in service, provided we continue to shed 'operational' credit responsibility and the current low level of large underwritten transactions and revals. Specific coverage holes and weakness will continue to be: EBS, German speaking credit person, depth in international markets, depth in market risk management.  10 heads would be quite disruptive and my recommendation would be to re-assess the role of RAC with an eye towards much less process work and immunity from finger pointing.  Budget to be finalized a more comprehensive business review is completed over the coming few weeks.  Perhaps we can discuss next week after you have reviewed.

" As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.  To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the ""Operational Risk Committee""), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson.    Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk.     The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements.    A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:   Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk.

"Rick: =20  Thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk. =  We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involve= d in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objecti= ves.  There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.=   Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of Enron's = businesses.  Is the initial focus simply on the ""wholesale businesses"", or = is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide? =20  I suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list t= o have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complemen= ting, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's = internal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being pilot= ed in London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA aud= its, Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the vario= us operations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other = Thursday with you and Rick Causey.   Before we each choose our appropriate = representatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cove= r this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo. =20  I might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilit= ies at the beginning of this project.  The creation of a framework for quan= tifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the impl= ementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit=  levels.  As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implement= ation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-deve= loped operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business uni= t/functional area outside RAC.

Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight=  when we review the details with you,  I think that it would be appropriate=  to take this item off of the Wanda's list.

"Rick:  Recently I received an E-Mail that you and Louise Kitchen discussed my group's $544k allocation for 2002 to ENA and determined that it was incorrect and should be only $109k with the balance of $435k going to Kevin Garland's group.  Actually I did take into account the transfer of the merchant investments to Kevin's group in coming up with the $544 allocation.  For the last several years our allocation to ENA has been in excess of $1.1 million so it is less than one-half of historical levels.  The $109k is definitely low considering the following services we perform for EA:   1)  Don Rollins and one of his Sr. Analysts spend nearly 100% of their time supporting the Thompson/Josey oil and gas group  in due diligence, transaction structuring, document preparation, auditing, partnership liquidations, asset sales, etc. (As you  know Don creates value several times his salary just in audit recoveries for ENA)   2) Even after the transfer to EPI, ENA still has over $850 million in assets that are maintained in PortRAC, Dash Library, and  certain of these asset have Watch list reporting etc. This takes at least one analyst's time.   3) There are other due diligence areas for ENA we support such as power.  We have been pretty active recently in power plant  purchase due diligence and actually have two of our experienced due diligence managers at a data room this week.    4)  We are going to lead the effort to develop a DASH numbering ""AFE type"" cost control system with ENA being the first  customer.  Please let me know your thoughts.  We had previously allocated Garland's group $544k.  If they pick up another $435k, I think that will be excessive and Kevin will be complaining.    Regards!

"Rick,  Attached are a clean copy of suggested modification of the body of this DASH as well as a copy of the original DASH.  This should give you some sense of the Arcos project's scale and risks.  John Sherriff and Michael Brown reportedly remain confident that this can be sold at a profit in the next three to nine months; however, if it is not, our economics on this project with a current termination cost of over $200 million is a negative NPV of approximately ($150 million).  The Enron board has not seen this, largely because the turbine cost is not specifically related to this project, but no other use of the turbines has been identified, so this project represents a huge potential loss if the sale is not successful.  Please let me know if you would like to discuss further.

Many of the comments I have made were based upon input from Chip Schneider to try to promote comparability of this transaction with similar development projects undertaken in the U.S.  In general, the view from Houston is that this project represents a significant amount of capital at risk and that this fact, as well as the expected economics of the project, should be highlighted to a greater extent than in the draft of the DASH you prepared.  While not noted on the DASH, discussion of where the 9FA turbines may be redeployed if this transaction does not progress to completion should be discussed somewhere in the DASH.

" Rick,  I have been asked by Michael to substantiate allocations from RAC - not necessarily to reduce them.   As proposed, they are:    Credit  $369k (5%)    Market  $630k (14%)    Und $499k (10%)    Port $108k (5%)  Given, that we have an Underwriting function here and do not have a large % of deals go to Houston for approval, I think this allocation seems high (recommend $250K) some of the excess can be attributed to the work of Jack/Jim/Brad on e&p and coal deals - these belong either in Global Markets, Global Assets or Principal investments For 2002, we will have  no assets  therefore  Portfolio number is also high (recommend  approx. 50k) - balance should go to principal investments and Global Assets. The market risk side, this office does take a fair amount of market risk on a relative basis and we have a relatively small group here on the ground as well as no Quantitative team or RisktRAC development/maintenance, this seems reasonable  - perhaps a little high (Recommend 12% or $550K) Given the amount of time we engage Bill on policy and deal analysis, the amount of work required on the Credit Aggregation System and process and, last , but not least, our portion of your fully loaded cost contained in Bill's budget which provides management, deal analysis, Underwriting support, this seems low - (recommend 7.5% or $555k) Please let me know what you think.

Ken Curry was asked to evaluate a related proposal a week back but is now on holiday and Rebecca Phillips was not brought up to speed. This latest proposal would be a European trade and the client is under time constraints and keen to move fast.  The transaction is as follows:  Enron has the right to sell to BK physical Hot Rolled Coil steel at Index (CRU HRC) + 7.5%   Start:  Jan2002  End:    Dec2016  Tonnage:        500 000 Metric Tonnes per annum (total tonnage: 7.5 million MT)  Enron pays a premium of 30 million USD upon contracting.  The CRU Index is Enron's benchmark steel index and physical steel trades at Index flat. There is thus 7.5% intrinsic value in the puts which translates to approx. $75 million USD in present value terms ($45million net of premium).  Our counterparty would be the parent of the soon to be combined Balli Klockner PLC and the various Balli service centres soon to be merged (BK Holdings Ltd UK).

Thanks Michael   -----Original Message----- From:  Murphy, Ted   Sent: 11 October 2001 10:22 To: Brown, Michael - COO London Subject: Headcount  Michael, I wanted to give you an update on the personnel front given that things are moving fairly fast and I want to make sure that I am keeping up with the evolution of your and John's thinking about resources.   Our original 2001 budget (adjusted) had 52 heads We have frozen the number at 44 which represents the people who are here (39) and those we have agreed to bring on board (5). We expect to drop up to  6 full time from the redundancy process - manager, 4 specialists, associate.  we plan to send one manager to Houston, and delay one arrival so that there is less overlap with Rod Nelson (expected departure 6/30/02) one employee would like to go part-time at beginning next year and I believe that she can be very productive in doing so.  we plan to use this process to drop one manager in Australia. I am planning to take on 2 (director, sr specialist) from other EEL units into London-RAC - est 50/50 EEL/non-EEL Also, one EEL-London employee (non-RAC) to relocate to Australia to replace person dropped in Australia.  Numerically, it looks like this:  Original  Budget - 2001    52 Current Headcount    44  Net of Original Budget (%)   8 (18%)  New (adjusted) Budget      44  Redundant    (6) Delay     (1) Re-deploy to Houston   (1) Part - time    (.5)  reductions     (8.5)   sub-total      35.5  Add  EBS Director   1  Enron Credit Sr Spec  1    additions      2  New Total       37.5     net % change (from original 2001 budget)  (28%)  net % change (from adjusted 2002 budget)  (15%)  The 1 addition and 1 subtraction in Australia will run through the Houston Credit budget with an allocation back to Australia electricity 50% and Global Markets 50% and represent a wash as regards headcount.  I would like to consider adding people up to the New (adjusted) Budget -44 -after the dust clears.  There are some internal people who have expressed some interest and a few candidates we have gotten close on that might be good candidates to replace the ones made redundant.  I am not asking for approval to do this. I will do so on a case-by-case basis after things settle out.  Let me know what you think.

I have obtained a copy of the 1994 House of Representatives report referenced in the March 1999 Der Spiegel article I noted in my initial report.  This House report contains derogatory allegations about the Alaghband family and their business practices -- the relevant section is included in the attached update.

I have also included excerpts of an interview with another source -- an Iranian businessman based in London who is a close personal and professional contact of the Alaghband family.  His comments are positive, barring Vahid Alaghband's alleged tendency to hold bills, and provide some additional information on the family and their  associations.

I have obtained a copy of the 1994 House of Representatives report referenced in the March 1999 Der Spiegel article I noted in my initial report.  This House report contains derogatory allegations about the Alaghband family and their business practices -- the relevant section is included in the attached update.  Sources note that the author of the report was known for ""sensational"" writing on topics difficult to verify.  I have also included excerpts of an interview with another source -- an Iranian businessman based in London who is a close personal and professional contact of the Alaghband family.  His comments are positive, barring Vahid Alaghband's alleged tendency to hold bills, and provide some additional information on the family and their  associations.    I believe this wraps up all outstanding inquiries on this matter.  Please let me know if you have questions or areas for additional inquiry.

" I do not believe the Alaghband issue was researched for the first deal; however, the two deals are vastly different from each other.  The first deal (with Webco JV) was a 1 year inventory management deal in which we had title to the product the entire time.  That risk profile contrasts sharply with a 15 year option with a $40MM unsecured loan. Per our London team, the deal does not break even until year 7, and much of the value is in the tail. Clearly, a higher level of due diligence should be required.  Additionally, Paul Maley does not have pro-forma data on the merged Balli-Klockner entity - just a company prepared presentation. Balli is purely a trading company, and it is our understanding that Klockner is largely the same; the new entity is projected to be extremely leveraged.   Please let me know if you have additional questions.

"ASME International Capitol Update October 17, 2001  *****************************  1. Senate Republicans to Introduce ""Homeland Energy Security Act of 2001"" -- Move would increase pressure on Majority Leader to schedule vote on energy policy  2. Pipeline Industry Calls for Legislation to Increase Security -- Industry not equipped to protect facilities from large-scale threats  3. Kyoto Rules to be Finalized Later this Month in Morocco -- U.S. delegation expected to attend  4. ""Tech Talent"" Bill Introduced in House and Senate -- ASME group endorses bill  5. ASME Ohio Council Urges Support for Tort Reform Measure -- S.B. 120 would redress joint and several liability standard  6. NIST Launches New E-Mail Service to Track Foreign Regulation of U.S. Exports       -- Automated service gathers proposed regulatory changes of 142 nations  *****************************  SENATE REPUBLICANS TO INTRODUCE ""HOMELAND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2001""  Senate Republicans intend to introduce a scaled-back energy policy bill not only to underscore GOP commitment to pass an energy bill this session, but also to increase the pressure on Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-ND) to schedule a floor vote on energy legislation before the session concludes.  The measure, to be titled the ""Homeland Energy Security Act of 2001"" is expected to focus mainly on increasing domestic production of oil and gas.  The bill is anticipated to include a controversial provision to allow energy exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but is not expected to include other contentious provisions such as auto fuel-efficiency standards, greenhouse-gas emissions caps and electricity restructuring issues.  In a related development, President Bush has added energy policy to his short-list of ""must approve"" legislation during the current session of Congress.  The President said that ""the less dependent we are on foreign sources of crude oil, the more secure we are at home.""  For additional information on energy-related issues, contact Francis Dietz at 202.785.3756 or at dietzf@asme.org.  PIPELINE INDUSTRY CALLS FOR LEGISLATION TO INCREASE SECURITY  The U.S. pipeline industry is calling for federal legislation to reduce security risks and to respond to large-scale threats.  In response to a request for suggestions on how to improve energy infrastructure security by Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), the Interstate National Gas Association of America (INGAA) recommends that in cases of specific and significant threats, ""the federal government consider making military forces and equipment available to help protect and/or monitor sensitive pipeline facilities.""  INGAA also recommended that legislation be introduced to amend the Freedom of Information Act to clarify that security-sensitive data be protected from public disclosure.   The American Gas Association (AGA) called for additional federal funding of research and development of new monitoring and detection equipment, as well as tax incentives that would allow natural gas utilities to recover the costs of enhancing energy infrastructure security.  Earlier this month, Chairman Bingaman introduced legislation to amend the Reclamation, Recreation Management Act of 1992 to provide security for dams, facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation.  To view a copy of that bill, S.1480, go to http://thomas.loc.gov/ and search by bill number.  KYOTO RULES TO BE FINALIZED LATER THIS MONTH IN MOROCCO  The U.S. is anticipated to send a delegation to the October 27-November 9 meeting in Marrakech, Morocco at which the final rules of a global treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are to be negotiated. However, the U.S. delegation will participate in a high-level segment of the meeting related to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change to which the U.S. is a party.  Because there are no plans for the U.S. to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the delegation will not participate in negotiations on implementing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the framework document. The Bush Administration, through the Environmental Protection Agency, is developing a plan to address climate change issues outside of the Kyoto Protocol.  The Kyoto Protocol will enter into force and become legally binding after it has been ratified by at least 55 parties to the convention, including industrialized countries representing at least 55 percent of the total 1990 carbon dioxide emissions within that group.  Thus far, 40 countries have ratified the Protocol, including one industrialized country, Romania. For additional information, contact Francis Dietz at 202.785.3756 or at dietzf@asme.org.  ""TECH TALENT"" BILL INTRODUCED IN HOUSE AND SENATE  Legislation designed to address the decline in the nation's technical workforce, and to improve undergraduate math and science education, has been introduced in both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The bi-partisan legislation, sponsored by Senators Joe Lieberman (D-CT), Christopher Bond (R-MO), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Bill Frist (R-TN), Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Representatives Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY) and John Larson (D-CT) would establish a competitive grants program through the National Science Foundation (NSF) to undergraduate institutions pledging to increase the number of U.S. citizens or permanent residents obtaining degrees in science, math, engineering and technology (SMET) fields.  A pilot program, which would award three-year grants, is authorized at $25 million in fiscal year 2002.  Funding increases are anticipated for out years.  The K-12 SMET Coalition, of which ASME's Council on Education is a member, has endorsed the legislation.  To view the letter, go to http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-42.html. For additional information, contact Patti Burgio at 202.785.3756 or at burgiop@asme.org.  ASME OHIO COUNCIL URGES SUPPORT FOR TORT REFORM MEASURE  ASME's Ohio Council, representing over 4300 ASME members in the state, has sent a letter to Ohio legislators urging support for S.B. 120, a bill that would significantly improve the state's civil justice system by limiting joint and several liability. The measure, currently under consideration by the Ohio House Civil and Commercial Law Committee, would ensure that a defendant would have to pay only its proportionate share of damages, for those defendants found to be 50 percent or less at fault.  To view of a copy of the letter, go to http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-41.html. For additional information on the bill, or on the Ohio Council, contact Gene Hulbert, ASME Ohio State Government Coordinator, at 614.882.0265 or hulbertL@asme.org.  NIST LAUNCHES NEW E-MAIL SERVICE TO TRACK FOREIGN REGULATION OF U.S. EXPORTS  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has launched a new e-mail service that advises U.S. businesses when foreign governments propose regulations that might influence the treatment of U.S. exports. Export Alert! Is an automated service that gathers, organizes and disseminates notifications of proposed regulatory changes issued by any of 142 nationals that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The early warning provided by Export Alert! is designed to ensure that subscribing U.S. organizations have adequate lead time to review and comment on proposed regulations.  To learn more about Export Alert!, go to www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-05.htm.  Information on how to subscribe to the service is available at http://ts.nist.gov/ncsci. For more detailed information, contact Mark Bello at mark.bello@nist.gov or at 301.975.3776.  ****************************  Mary James Legatski Government Relations Representative ASME International 1828 L Street, NW, Suite 906 Washington, DC  20036 Phone:  202.785.7380 Fax:  202.429.9417 Email:  legatskim@asme.org  -------------------------------- You are currently subscribed to ASME's capitol-news list as: rick.buy@enron.com To change your personal information, or email address please click on the link below: https://www.asmeny.org/memberaddr/html/security.htm  To unsubscribe send a blank email to leave-capitol-news-3062J@list.asme.org or click here: http://www.asmeny.org/cgi-bin1/WEB400CE?3062+ANT007+N+99999 --------------------------------",rick.buy@enron.com,capitol-news@list.asme.org,"Capitol Update ASME International October 17, 2001",2001-10-18 07:42:49-07:00,received
"Rick,  One thought to absorb some of the budget would be to purchase Blackberry mobile devices for some of the RAC staff.  With many of the business units migrating to the new building, it is likely to be beneficial to have continuous e-mail access when Underwriters and others in the group are away from the floor.  The cost of the units, which seem to be the technology of choice, is about $300 apiece; monthly charges are about $30.  Please let me know your opinion.

During the next few weeks,  we'll bring you behind-the-scenes looks at its  development, stories from the Treo design team, a  sneak peak at some features and a whole lot more.  To learn more about Treo communicator, go to:  http://mojofarm.mediaplex.com/ad/ck/629-4408-2493-28?ck=treo1   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Road to Integration  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  The concept isn't new. If you carry around a mobile  phone and an organizer, you've probably wished  someone would figure out how to combine them both  into one small device. Now imagine if you also had  to carry around a pager or a messaging device. Do  this for a while and you'll understand the benefit  of putting all three into one package.   But successfully combining these devices involves  much more than simply fitting them all into a single  unit. Sure, you might get a good phone, but probably  at the expense of a decent organizer. That's because  the individual needs of these devices are in  constant conflict with each other. A good mobile  phone needs to be small, but organizers and web  browsers need to have reasonably-sized screens to  get the job done. And a numeric keypad is great for  dialing numbers, but challenging for text entry.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  No Room for Compromise  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  These were some of the challenges the Treo design  team faced when they started creating this product.  The team wanted a device that looked and felt  comfortable as a phone, but also worked perfectly  as an organizer and wireless data device.   ""Other products that have existed in the past have  been compromises,"" explains Jeff Hawkins, co-founder  of Handspring and inventor of the PalmPilot(R).  ""You've had to trade off some of the main features  to get the combined device. Our goal with Treo was  to find a no-compromise solution.""   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Powerful Possibilities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  The team began to consider everything that was  possible in a combined phone and organizer that  could not be achieved with stand-alone devices. And  what they found was often times surprisingly  powerful. The result is a device that actually  improves upon each of its individual components  through a variety of unique features.  ""The thing about Treo,"" Hawkins says, ""is that it's  small enough to be a phone, and yet it's improved  upon the phone and it's improved upon the organizer  and it's added wireless data capabilities that no  phone or organizer has ever had. And by combining  them all together, you basically have a smaller  product that does more than either one does  separately.""   In the weeks to come, we'll show you some of the  unique features that resulted from this successful  integration, along with the thinking that went into  them. You'll get an in-depth look at what happens  when you take a phone, an organizer and a  messenger--add wireless Internet capabilities--and  successfully combine them into one powerful device  that does it all.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Coming next week...  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Why you'll never have to dial a phone number again.     *****************************************************************************  Tips & Tricks  *****************************************************************************  You already know that To Do lets you keep track of  those little tasks that call upon you each day.

Just ask  Visor handheld owners Kevin and Cindy of Wisconsin.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Designing the Perfect Toy Store  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  My wife and I both have Visor handhelds. She has  the basic and I have the Deluxe. We both have the  eyemodule1 and the VisorPhone.   My wife is an area manager for a large toy company.  She is based in Wisconsin and her territory includes  Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota. She uses the  eyemodule1 to immediately capture visual examples  of how stores in her territory should be set up and  sends them (via the VisorPhone) to her headquarters  in live time.

If you carry around a mobile phone and an organizer, you've probably wished  someone would figure out how to combine them both into one small device.

Sure, you might get a good phone, but probably at the expense of a decent organizer. That's  because the individual needs of these devices are in constant conflict with each other. A good mobile  phone needs to be small, but organizers and web browsers need to have reasonably-sized screens to get  the job done. And a numeric keypad is great for dialing numbers, but challenging for text entry.<br><br></font></td> <td><a href=""http://4at3.net/KC15271645.4131.0.4623""><img src=""http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0058/final/images/treo_4.jpg"" width=""66"" height=""170"" border=""0"" alt="""" hspace=""50""></a><br> <div align=""center""><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif"" size=""1""><a href=""http://4at3.net/KC15271645.4131.0.4623"">learn more about Treo!</a></font></div></td></tr></table></td></tr>  <tr><td><table><tr> <td valign=""top""><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif"" size=""2""> <b>No Room for Compromise</b><br> These were some of the challenges the Treo design team faced when they started creating this product.  The team wanted a device that looked and felt comfortable as a phone, but also worked perfectly as an  organizer and wireless data device.<p> ""Other products that have existed in the past have been compromises,"" explains Jeff Hawkins, co-founder  of Handspring and inventor of the PalmPilot&#174;. ""You've had to trade off some of the main features to get  the combined device. Our goal with Treo was to find a no-compromise solution.""<p> <b>Powerful Possibilities</b><br> The team began to consider everything that was possible in a combined phone and organizer that could  not be achieved with stand-alone devices. And what they found was often times surprisingly powerful.  The result is a device that actually improves upon each of its individual components through a variety  of unique features.<p> ""The thing about Treo,"" Hawkins says, ""is that it's small enough to be a phone, and yet it's improved  upon the phone and it's improved upon the organizer and it's added wireless data capabilities that no  phone or organizer has ever had. And by combining them all together, you basically have a smaller  product that does more than either one does separately.""<p> In the weeks to come, we'll show you some of the unique features that resulted from this successful  integration, along with the thinking that went into them. You'll get an in-depth look at what happens  when you take a phone, an organizer and a messenger&#8212;add wireless Internet capabilities&#8212;and successfully  combine them into one powerful device that does it all.<p> <font face=""Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif"" size=""3""><b>Coming next week...</b><br> <i>Why you'll never have to dial a phone number again</i>.</font></font></td> </tr></table></td></tr>  <tr><td><img src=""http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif"" width=""1"" height=""40"" border=""0""></td></tr>  <tr><td><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif"" size=""4"" color=""#FF9900""><b>Tips & Tricks</b></font><br> <font face=""Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif"" size=""2"">You already know that To Do lets you keep track of  those little tasks that call upon you each day.

"ASME International Capitol Update October 24, 2001  *****************************  1. Senate Confirms Two Senior Science and Technology Appointees -- OSTP Director and Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology approved unanimously  2. Education Provisions Advance in Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bills -- House and Senate versions differ on funding levels for math and science education initiatives  3. ""Quadrennial Defense Review Report"" Released -- Report recommends increasing S&T funding to three percent of DOD budget  4. Whitaker Foundation to Phase Out Grant Program -- Grant phase out to coincide with Foundation's planned closing in 2006  5. Department of Education Announces Grants for Transitions to Teaching Program -- $31 million allocated to recruit mid-career professionals for teaching careers  *****************************  SENATE CONFIRMS TWO SENIOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY APPOINTEES  On October 23rd, the Senate unanimously confirmed John H. Marburger III of New York to be Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Marburger managed Brookhaven, a facility in Upton, NY, that conducts basic and applied research for the Department of Energy. He was president of Stony Brook from 1980 until 1994. At his confirmation hearing last month before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, he stated that directing research to help combat terrorist attacks and emphasizing research on global climate change would top his list of priorities.  Marburger indicated that he would urge the Bush Administration to support research across many disciplines, especially in the chemistry, engineering and mathematics disciplines. ""Balance in this broad research portfolio recognizes that advances in one field, such as medicine, are often dependent on gains in other disciplines,"" he noted.    The Senate also confirmed Phillip Bond of Virginia to be Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology. In that capacity, Bond will oversee technology policy, space commercialization and next-generation vehicles for the U.S. Department of Commerce. He will also supervise the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS).  Bond had previously served as Director of Federal Public Policy Programs for Hewlett-Packard.  EDUCATION PROVISIONS ADVANCE IN LABOR-HHS-EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILLS  House and Senate appropriators are moving forward on FY 2002 funding of key Department of Education math and science education improvement programs. However, their respective appropriations bills vary significantly on specific funding levels. Last year, funding for these programs was contained in the Eisenhower program's $485 million budget to fund teacher professional development, with $250 million set aside specifically for professional development in math and science. The current year's budget eliminates the Eisenhower program and consolidates teacher professional development into a broader category called ""Teacher Quality.""  Within the ""Teacher Quality"" category is a new initiative, the Math and Science Partnerships, which will provide competitive grants to partnerships of university departments, state education agencies, local school districts and others to improve math and science education through professional development and other activities. For FY 2002, the House appropriation would provide between $476 million and $635 million for the partnership initiative, compared with only $25 million in the Senate appropriation.  The difference will be settled by a House-Senate conference.  For additional information on K-12 science, math, engineering and technology education, contact Patti Burgio at 202.785.3756 or at burgiop@asme.org.  ""QUADRENNNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW REPORT"" RELEASED  The ""Quadrennial Defense Review Report,"" issued every four years by the Department of Defense (DOD), is a planning document to guide changes in program direction.  A central objective of the most recent review as to shift the basis of defense planning from a threat-based model that has dominated thinking in the past to a capabilities-based model for the future. The report, compiled by senior civilian and military leaders within DOD, calls for a significant increase in funding for science and technology (S&T) programs to a level of three percent of DOD spending annually. By comparison, the Bush Administration's FY 2002 request for DOD is $343 billion. Of that amount, 2.7 percent would be allocated to S&T.  The report states, ""A robust research and development effort is imperative to achieving the Department's transformation objectives. DOD must maintain a strong S&T program that supports evolving military needs and ensures technological superiority over potential adversaries.""  DOD S&T activities consist of the 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 programs.  To view a copy of the report, go to http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/qdr2001.pdf For additional information on DOD S&T issues, contact Kathryn Holmes at 202.786.3756 or at holmesk@asme.org.  WHITAKER FOUNDATION TO PHASE OUT GRANT PROGRAM  The Whitaker Foundation, which has invested more than $575 million in biomedical engineering education and research, is continuing to phase out its grant programs to coincide with its planned closing in 2006. The goal of the foundation has been to accelerate the formation of a solid educational infrastructure at universities and a well-trained cadre of researchers and teachers by investing all of its resources over a relatively short period of time. In 1991, the foundation set a closing date of 2006 and accordingly raised its annual spending from $14 million in 1991 to between $60 million and $70 million annually from 2001 through 2005.  The foundation will continue to fund existing multiyear awards, but will no longer accept new applications for Leadership-Development Awards, i.e., large, long-term institutional awards. Four more competitions will be held for the Special Opportunity in Biomedical Engineering awards, three-year institutional awards to develop and enhance educational programs. Two more annual competitions will be held for the Graduate Fellowships in Biomedical Engineering, designed to help graduate students prepare for research careers in biomedical engineering. For additional information on these and other grant programs, go to http://www.whitaker.org/news/phaseout.html  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ANNOUNCES GRANTS FOR TRANSITIONS TO TEACHING PROGRAM  The Department of Education has announced 42 grants totaling $31 million to recruit mid-career professionals and recent college graduates for teaching careers. The grants, to be issued under the new Transitions to Teaching Program, will go to school districts, states or national organizations. Grantees must ensure that the recruits receive special assistance, guidance, support, and in some cases stipends and incentives, to make teaching a long-term career. Information on the funded projects is available at http://www.ed.gov/offices/OESE/  In a related matter, the Department of Education has also awarded $5 million to the National Council on Teacher Quality to launch the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence. See  http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/10-2001/10052001e.html The Board will create a standard for teachers from non-traditional backgrounds to ensure that they will have credibility within the education system. The National Council on Teacher Quality is a nonprofit organizations affiliated with the Education Leaders Council and the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation.  For additional information, go to http://www.nctq.org/about.html  For additional information on education-related issues, contact Patti Burgio at 202.785.3756 or at burgiop@asme.org.  ****************************  Mary James Legatski Public Affairs Program Manager ASME International 1828 L Street, NW, Suite 906 Washington, DC  20036 Phone:  202.785.3756 Fax:  202.429.9417 Email:  legatskim@asme.org   -------------------------------- You are currently subscribed to ASME's capitol-news list as: rick.buy@enron.com To change your personal information, or email address please click on the link below: https://www.asmeny.org/memberaddr/html/security.htm  To unsubscribe send a blank email to leave-capitol-news-442645A@list.asme.org or click here: http://www.asmeny.org/cgi-bin1/WEB400CE?+ANT007+N+99999 --------------------------------",rick.buy@enron.com,capitol-news@list.asme.org,"Capitol Update ASME International October 24, 2001",2001-10-25 17:59:16-07:00,received

The management of cash collateral is extremely important and we need accurate information, in order to manage our daily cash position.    Please advise of any other counterparty that manual wires were made.    How can we resolve this issue promptly?   Thanks,  Veronica Gonzalez Credit Analyst Enron Corp.

"Rick - this is the event that Cal Payne spoke to you about several weeks ago.  He indicated to me that you would be interested in attending.    I am David Johnson - a partner with Andersen and we are sponsoring the Risk Officers Roundtable.  This is not a training seminar or an event with an audience.  This group has been meeting for a couple of years and recently asked Andersen to take the lead in facilitating the group.  The objective of this group is to focus on issues that each of you are facing as risk officers or leading energy trading organizations.  The ideas and issues dicussed will remain confidential.  This is a forum for people facing similar issues to bounce ideas off of each other and to discuss topics of mutual interest.  From an anti-trust perspective, competitive approaches as an industry or similar initiatives will not be discussed.  The group will meet about 4 times a year  Our plans for the next meeting are as follows:  Location  - Las Vegas (Bellagio currently has rooms for $129/night)  Date - Monday November 12 and Tuesday November 13  Agenda - We will get with each attendee and formulate an agenda.  This will be circulated prior to the meeting.  Attendees -  Confirmed - Eddie Meche, Reliant, Philip Chesson - Williams, Glen Labhart - Dynegy, Cal Payne - UtiliCorp Invitations extended to Rick Buy - Enron, Rich Osborne - Duke, Mark Randle - Sempra and Bob Andersen - ElPaso.  The group will be limited to these indivuduals unless the participants desire to add other indivuduals to the mix.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713.237.2351.

"         FROM ROB WALLS AND JOHN ALE  First, thank you very much for your prompt responses to our requests for comments on the draft Agreement and Plan of Merger distributed Tuesday and for items that would go on a disclosure schedule.  This has been hard work in a short period.  More hard work is to come.  Although no decision has been made on whether our company wishes to pursue this alternative and, if so, whether acceptable terms can be reached, we have been instructed to be in a position to sign the agreement and deliver the disclosure letter by this Sunday night.  To this end, we are attaching a revised draft of the agreement.  Please review again the provisions of this agreement to see whether there are any further changes to be made.  We are collating the information you have provided for disclosure schedules and will circulate a draft tonight or Friday morning for your further comments.  Note that we are attempting to have the term ""Subsidiary"" defined to include only consolidated subsidiaires.  We must be prepared, however, to include some representations about significant off-balance-sheet entities.  Accordingly, as you review drafts of the agreement and the disclosure letter, please note any comments that apply only to unconsolidated entities.  Please return your comments to Rob Walls (EB 5012) or John Ale (3AC 1023) by Friday at 3:00 pm.  If you send matters by email, please send it to both of us and Norma Tidrow (at Azurix).    As before, if you need to speak with someone else in your group, please clear that with one of us.  If you have any questions, please call one of us.  Also, given that we may need to make changes over the weekend, please let us know how we can reach you over the weekend.  Thanks in advance for your continued help.

"  FROM ROB WALLS AND JOHN ALE:  We have just discussed a few items with the commercial team and Rockne and have come to the following compromise as matters relate to ""Subsidiaries"":  ""Subsidiary"" will include all entities owned or controlled 50% or more by Gipper.  That will pick up several unconsolidated entities, either because of a high economic interest or control of the board of a general partner (e.g., Azurix, EOTT).  All matters disclosed in Gipper's SEC filings or filings by significant subs that file their own public reports (e.g., Azurix, EOTT) will be exceptions to every representation.  Section 5.7, insofar as it applies to any balance sheets, will include consolidated subsidiaries only.  (Note that the rep might expand to include financials on unconsolidated entities that file separate SEC reports).  All items in Section 5.22 are being deleted other than clause (iii), but will continue to pick up VP and above.  In other words, the contract list needs to show  deals of $500,000 or more with officers of Gipper and Subsidiaires (50% or more ownership or control) in which an officer at VP or above personally has an interest.  Also, in listing matters, please recall that materiality is defined with reference to Gipper and its subs taken as a whole.  That's a very high threshhold.  Thanks.

We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.  Things are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.

Rick  -----Original Message----- From:  Wenz, Michelle   Sent: Tuesday, November 06, 2001 9:19 AM To: Buy, Rick; Bradford, William S. Subject: Question for Bank Meeting Today Importance: High  In preparation for Friday's Bank Conference, Cheryl Lipshutz and I are sitting with the banks right now and we understand that you are meeting with them at 2pm this afternoon.  Here is a list of the initial questions they are posing to the RAC group:  RAC 1. Does VAR analyses take care of the quality and predictability in regard to price risk management? (JP) 2. Is the risk control and deal approval process going to change? (B) 3. What percent of wholesale power and gas trading business does the top twenty counterparties represent? (B) 4. Has Enron been asked to raise the amount of collateral posted by any counterparties?  What is the aggregate amount? (B) 5. How is the credit downgrades expected to affect Enron's margin requirements?  How much extra cash will be needed in the immediate term to cover these requirements?  What would the source be for this cash? (B) 6. What is the sensitivity analysis of the trading portfolios from a liquidity and margining requirement standpoint based upon i) two standard deviations in the relevant underlying commodity price both upward and downward, ii) a one notch credit downgrade by S&P, in addition to the action already taken by Moody's and Fitch, and iii) a combination of the two scenarios? (BNP)  What is the availability of sufficient liquidity to accommodate such scenarios? (BNP) 7. Provide daily average, high and low VAR for 2000 and first quarter 2001 versus month-end values as provided in filings. (S) 8. How are VAR limits established? (S) 9. What are the various VAR limits and how often have they been exceeded in the last year?  How and when would VAR limits be adjusted? (S) 10. What assumptions underlie VAR calculations?  Does VAR include operational risk? (S) 11. Given Enron's VAR policy, will VAR grow as trading volumes increase? (S) 12. Why is Enron's VAR higher than other traders, including merchant banks? (S) 13. What risk information is distributed?  How timely is the information? (S) 14. What financial measures does the company consider important in tracking the success of its trading business? (S) 15. How is the VAR model validated?  Is the model backtested?  If so, is it a theoretical backtest where positions are held fixed or an actual backtest where actual P&L is compared to the estimated VAR?  How many times last year did the back tested value exceed the VAR? (S) 16. What is the model vetting process?  Who is responsible for validating traders' models?  What is the time lag between front office development of a model and validation?  Are there any products that use unvalidated models for trading purposes or P&L? (S) 17. How does the company ensure that traders use appropriate marks when marking to market? (S) 18. Who monitors limits? (S) 19. How frequently is the trading operation audited by internal and external auditors? (S) 20. Is there a formal stress test that estimates the impact of a credit downgrade?  What is the qualitative assessment of such an event? (S) 21. What is the current and year end expected counterparty exposure?  Gross or net of collateral? (S) 22. What is the investment/non-investment grade counterparty exposure split for 2000 and first quarter 2001? (S) 23. What percentage of investment grade counterparty credit risk is BBB+ or below? (S) 24. How often does Enron review the credit rating of counterparties? (S) 25. What is the breakdown of liabilities from price risk management activities? (H) 26. Which companies are Enron's largest trading partners (share in trading turnover)? (H)  27. What is the total dollar amount Enron would have to post if i) downgraded to BBB- by S&P/Moody's, or ii) downgraded to non-investment grade by S&P/Moody's if called on all trading collateral accounts? (B) 28. Does Enron guarantee the obligations of the trading subsidiaries?

Now, when you type in www.erisk.com, you'll get a better idea of all of ERisk's activities. You'll find all our usual editorially independent news, community and reference resources under the 'Portal' tab.   Weekly Review In this week's round-up <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0bNX0Au> of economic, banking and P&C insurance news from an enterprise risk management perspective: global rate cuts boost markets, but economic news continues to be gloomy; Enron faces takeover by competitor; the strange case of the mystery credit crunch; tough times for the mortgage industry; legal action continues over World Trade Center claims.   Analysis  The massive scale of claims arising from September 11 has worried many in the P&C insurance market, but harder rates should benefit those who are strong enough to take advantage of them. In this week's analysis <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0bNY0Av>, we look at how Lloyd's of London is struggling to convince rating agencies and insurance regulators that it is sufficiently solvent to bounce back from its World Trade Center losses and to benefit from a stronger market.  Viewpoint Will Dynegy clinch a cut-rate acquisition of its troubled arch-rival, Enron? You can catch up on some of the background with ERisk's exclusive interviews with their chief risk officers: we spoke to Enron's Rick Buy <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0bNZ0Aw> earlier this year, while Dynegy CRO Glenn Labhart <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0Mde0AA> was the subject of our CRO Profile in August.

In ""Bank Credit Processes and Operational Risk"", an exclusive new feature <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0B4W0Av> for ERisk, Becky Walzak of Boston Portfolio Advisors looks at what can go wrong, explores the increasing cost of failed deals on the secondary credit markets, and offers a solution based on ideas within the Basle II regulatory capital reform proposals.

Rick  One question we are often asked is how do security and risk relate?  Risk is the potential reduction in asset values from threats and vulnerabilities. Security is an ability you possess to protect specific assets in specific way(s).  So the answer is:  Security is able to reduce risk in specific areas but without the full breadth of risk defined it is impossible to determine how significant security solutions are.

"         ... how about an LBO?  Certain high net worth executives sponsor the deal in conjunction with a major financial investor such as JPM/Chase or Citibank.  Force the share trust participants to go along and cut in all management and employees.  It gets the company out of the spotlight and might have some real attraction for deal starved investors... esp at this price level.  It could remotivate everyone and provide a way to recover some of the lost value that had accrued to the employees over the years.  Obviously, some stakeholders would do better that others but that's the way it goes sometimes.  Just a thought.  Hang in there.

If you wanted to attend but couldn't, you can still check out videos of Jeff Hawkins' engaging keynote address and a product demo straight from the trade show floor. Check out the highlights from Comdex <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3277.233.34125625>     <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>  Treo Talk Last time, we talked about how the new Treo? communicator <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3278.233.34125625> lets you stay in touch when you just can't talk on the phone. This week we'll look at how it lets you surf the web-without wires.    Bandwidth on the Run For most people the experience of ""surfing the web"" wirelessly has been more akin to wading in the shallow end of a pool. Even when you're able to access one of the select few websites that have been optimized for WAP (wireless application protocol), tiny mobile phone screens often mean endlessly scrolling through blocks of text one small line at a time. The Treo communicator changes all that.    <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>  The Treo communicator comes loaded with Blazer? 2.0 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3279.233.34125625>, the latest version of Handspring's award-winning web browser for the Palm OS . Blazer lets you securely view virtually any HTML, cHTML or WAP web site in its entirety-with full text and graphics formatted to look great on your Treo screen. So the content you see on your Treo communicator is the same as what you would find on your desktop computer. Plus, you can bookmark up to fifty sites, so the information you want the most is always at your fingertips.    <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>  <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3280.233.34125625>  Take movie listings, news headlines,and shopping deals with you, on-the-go. <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3280.233.34125625>     <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>  Even if you've never accessed the web from a mobile device before, Treo makes it easy to see why you would want to. Imagine having instant access to a map when you get lost on the road. Or checking a stock quote during a power lunch. Or reading the top headlines on your way to work. Or buying movie tickets on the way to the theater. The Treo communicator lets you do all this and so much more-wherever you are.    <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>  The Word Is Out Want to hear what others have to say about Treo? Here's a small sampling of some of the buzz <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3281.233.34125625> that this amazing product has generated so far.    <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>  Coming next week...

Customize Your Synchronization You can shave time off your HotSync operation by only synchronizing the programs you actually use. Don't use the Expense application? Never read your email on the road? Don't waste precious synchronization time. Just open the Palm Desktop, choose the HotSync drop-down menu, and click Custom. You'll get a list of all the applications that synchronize. Simply change the ones you no longer need from Synchronize the files to Do Nothing and you're ready to start saving time!

Find out how reader Matthew S. used his to calculate complex traffic problems for Calgary's Transportation Department.  Visor Gets the Green Light  This summer I had the privilege of working for the Transportation Department of the City of Calgary here in Calgary, Canada. One of the projects I aided was a study into the start-up delays of vehicles once the traffic light turns green. There can be as much as a five second delay between when the light turns green and the rear axel of the first vehicle in the queue crossing into the intersection. This delay must be taken into account when trying to establish a value for the number of cars that can make it through a light in an hour of green time. This value, in turn, is used in many intersection decisions.   Our task was to determine how many cars would make it through the intersection in one hour of green time (one hour of green time is the sum of the green times during each red, yellow, green phase until they total one hour). For this study, I downloaded a program SportsWatch v1.4 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3290.233.34125625> onto my Handspring Visor Deluxe, which allowed us to record every car crossing, something that would have been impossible with a simple stopwatch. It allowed us to time the crossing of the rear axel for every car in the queue, since when you hit the 'lap' button, it records the time elapsed and outputs it as text. From here, it is a simple matter of copying the results to a memo in memo pad and saving.  Back at the office, we were able to synchronize the Handspring Visor with the Palm Desktop software and the memos containing the information were suddenly digital documents, with no laborious data entry needed. The results could be cut and pasted into a simple MS Excel spreadsheet to be analyzed and used in our study. This made for a more complete dataset, and hopefully more credible conclusions. As well, the cumbersome task of entering the recorded data was avoided by utilizing the quick and simple synchronization system, saving us a considerable amount of time. The Handspring Visor helped to make the data collection process more complete, easier to accomplish, and more efficient to import after collection.

"Rick, As follow-up to our discussion of today, we would like to explain our concerns. EEL entities are under control of an administrator - Price Waterhouse - who represents the interest of the creditors of those entities. All decisions regarding those entities are being made by the administrator.  Michael Brown, Fernley Dyson, John Sherriff are not in the building and to the best of my knowledge have resigned all directorships. Most of the remaining employees (300) are working for the administrator.   There are, however, interests of Enron Corp which are housed in Enron House may not be getting the attention they deserve or , potentially more concerning, are being used or eyed by the locals for their benefit.  Examples are : 1) the contractual assets in ECTRIC which include financial trades, weather derivatives, nordic energy, some crude and products trading. 2) large in the money pumped storage trade which is in a US-based LLC - in the money by a net $50MM 3) Enron Direct is being offered for sale (JV with EES) 4) The TXU VPS contracts (currently under termination dispute) is being negotiated solely by administrators and their employees  Transactions are being terminated by counterparties, deals are being cut between the administrators and commercial for the dispostion of assets, and value is being eroded because no support staff will work without a reasonable expectation of being paid.  Finally, the administrators have been here for several weeks and seem woefully prepared to take on the task at hand.  We suggest that the Houston-based 'investor' (whether that is current managment or a trustee) ought to reconstitute some form of governance over its activities in Europe so that it can be assured of receiving maximum value for its assets here.    Currently, we have little capability to cause the local staff to provide us with the information and access to make informed decisions.  Please give us a call so we can discuss a course of action, if any, you would like us to take.  Ted",rick.buy@enron.com,ted.murphy@enron.com,US Interests in Europe,2001-12-04 00:46:56-08:00,received

"Rick,  My views are as follows:  - The sale of the deepwater assets makes sense due to their requirement of significant ongoing capital expenditures; the other assets of the company should also be auctioned off concurrently (although we would retain the right to continue to hold them if the offers received were inadequate); research into our commitments to Lehman as the sales advisor previously needs to be conducted (I have asked Don Miller in Corporate Development to research this).  - The fact that the Mariner severance package is considerably better than the Enron package will be is a significant optical issue and not reducing it may create an issue with the creditors committee for the Enron bankruptcy.  - The extension of employment agreements and consulting agreements, in my opinion, should be for a shorter time period, say to March 31, 2002, again in light of the Enron situation and the optics to the creditors committee.

"Dear Rick,  I quickly wanted to send you my new contact information as well as ask you about my Cash Balance Plan.  My fifth anniversary with Enron is coming up this Sunday, December 9.  The Cash Balance Plan vests after five years and I want to make sure that HR's comments to me regarding the plan are right.  HR (Sheila Walton) told me last week that I need not to worry about vesting in the plan since we will officially still be Enron employees as long as we are getting paid severance.  With the latest information we got this seems to be questionable now.  HR and Benefits do not seem to know what is going on now; all my questions remained unanswered when I called them this morning.  Benefits stated that as long as my termination date was after the 9th of December I would vest.  HR doesn't seem to know when my official termination date is. If needed, I have more than 10 days of unused vacation; I could be deemed on vacation and terminated after the 9th.  I would like to ask you to help me with this matter and try to set my termination date after December 9, i.e. at the earliest next Monday.  I feel that the company has left us with absolutely nothing but an extreme lack of information and loads of unanswered questions. I do not see myself in a position where I want to give my Cash Balance Plan up.  My contact information is: Carol North 651 Bering Dr. #1705 Houston, TX 77057  Tel: 713-972-1002 (hm) 713-530-4746 (mob) email: cnorth@houston.rr.com  Thanks again for all your efforts, I really enjoyed my time in RAC, and you were right, I did learn many useful tools for my future endeavors.

"Rick:  There is no legal requirement that the Board determine, approve or r= atify the Section 16 list of officers (although in practice, we have asked = them to do so in the past, at least on an annual basis).  Whether someone i= s an executive officer is a question of fact, and I have not gotten any res= ponses from others that I have attempted to get information from to determi= ne whether or not we should update the list (the lack of response, I'm sure= , is due to the fact that there is a lot of stuff going on).  So, I will gi= ve you a call to discuss: (i) has your title changed? (ii) have your respon= sibilities changed? (i.e., are you still the Chief Risk Officer?)  In the e= nvironment of a Chapter 11 proceeding, is there any need for a chief risk o= fficer?  (iii) are you still on the Executive Committee (is there still an = Exec. Committee, does it still meet and what are its duties and responsibil= ities?).  No one factor is determinative---the issues are:  do you oversee = or set policy for an important business or administrative function of the C= ompany?

Rick   -----Original Message----- From:  Murphy, Ted   Sent: Friday, December 14, 2001 5:54 AM To: Callahan, Timothy; Jones, Michael B Cc: Buy, Rick; Fallon, Jim Subject: Personal Tax Liabilities  Tim, I have just recieved my pay stub for the period ending 11/30/01. For the first time, it shows an incredibly disturbing number related to imputed income. Total Earnings = $352,171 Total Earnings plus Imputed = $1,338, 394.08  Taxes withheld = $19,895.  I do not have any clue as what this imputed income is or why it may be attributed to me.  However,  as I understand it, I am liable for the taxes to the IRS even though I received no benefit. From our last conversation, I was told that $57k was sent to IRS to settle this amount and ?86k for uK liabilities. My calculation of the liability is much higher - somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% x 1,338,395 or $535,358.  Please give me a full accounting of the taxable liabilities incurred by Enron on my behalf for the tax year 2001 for both the us and uk and the tax payments made. I would appreciate that this could be done in the next 24 hours as it is causing immense stress.    I also spoke to PWC in the UK 2 minutes ago who told me that they were not doing any work for Enron at the moment.

Based on our initial comparison of the amended complaint versus the original one (our comparison was ""line by line"" but not ""word for word""), it appears that the only change was to add four specific requests for relief at the very end of the complaint - namely, ""to order an accounting of insider-trading proceeds,"" ""disgorgement of insider-trading proceeds,"" ""restitution of investors' monies of which they were defrauded,"" and ""as to the section 11 claims, awarding rescission or a rescissionary measure of damages."" These additions are technical in nature and probably were designed principally to preempt any copycat suits by other plaintiffs' attorneys. The amended complaint does not appear to contain any revision of the factual allegations or asserted causes of action.

"Thursday, December 27, 2001  Richard B Buy Enron ,     Dear Richard  Here's to wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!!!! I  think that 2002 is going to be a much better year than 2001!!!!!  Here's a great article from the most recent issue of Fast Company. All  indicators point towards a turnaround.  PS I apoligize if you got this email message twice;  I have two email  databases and they overlap.  Dal Coger Tsunami Partners 781-874-0527  Digital Matters - Issue 52 Most everyone has written off the dotcoms. Smart investors are finding the  real value. by Fast Company illustrations by Jack Unruh from FC issue 52, page 74 Alt Text  Every nine months McKinsey and Co., the world's premier management  consultancy, publishes an ""e-performance"" survey of more than 200 Internet  businesses around the world. These dotcom companies have combined revenues  of roughly $2 billion. The most recent survey, published in May 2001, found  that 20% of the companies covered were profitable and that a significant  number of the others were heading in that direction. Dotcoms that were making money were ""e-tailers,"" with clothing e-tailers  doing particularly well. Companies that were losing money were content  sites; news and sports sites were struggling the most. Monika Kubicova, one  of four McKinsey consultants who oversee the survey, told the Financial  Times, ""For e-tailers there is quite good reason for optimism, with a  reasonable number starting to show profitability. Content businesses,  however, are still playing with their business models and are in the red."" The McKinsey survey received virtually no press coverage, because it did not  fit the major media's prevailing conventional wisdom, which is that the  Internet sector in general -- and the dotcom sector in particular -- is as  dead as smelts. But as the survey makes clear, for something so dead, these  sectors are showing all kinds of life. This past July, a streamlined  priceline.com announced that it had turned a second-quarter profit. Google,  the search-engine site that is now run by former Novell wizard Eric Schmidt,  recently announced that it was solidly profitable. EBay, Travelocity.com,  and a host of other companies also reported strong second-quarter earnings.  All of these solid performances occurred in the teeth of a global economic  slowdown. Indeed, the big, largely unreported summer story of 2001 was the renewal of  financial interest in all things related to the Internet. Goldman Sachs and  other major investment houses swarmed across Europe, bottom-fishing among  distressed telecom and wireless properties. Deal flow in  Internet-infrastructure companies quickened in the United States as price  points became much more ""realistic."" Even seemingly doomed content companies  such as Salon.com attracted funding. A couple of years from now, people will look back on the summer of 2001 as  the time when the music started up again. Dan Burstein, a managing partner  of Millennium Technology Ventures LP ( MTVLP ), is one among many smart  investors who see the wind shifting. For almost 15 months, Burstein says,  MTVLP didn't see a deal that was worth the price of admission. In fall 2000,  MTVLP knew of one that was priced at $1 billion. By spring 2001, that exact  same deal was valued at below $100 million. At $1 billion, the deal was an  almost perfect metaphor for Internet insanity. At below $100 million, it was  a good investment. MTVLP bought a stake. Burstein sees the current situation  as analogous to the savings-and-loan crisis and the great real-estate  collapse of the late 1980s to early 1990s. The S&L meltdown led to  write-offs of more than $500 billion and caused a meltdown in the  real-estate sector. At the time, there was much talk about ""overcapacity""  and ""glut"" in the real-estate mark! ets. Today, the telecom industry may have to write off anywhere from $300  billion to $1 trillion in bad debt. And that has caused severe distress in  the Internet-infrastructure world. Having worked at the Blackstone Group LP prior to setting up MTVLP, Burstein  has good institutional memory of what a big opportunity looks like. Under  the direction of former commerce secretary Pete Peterson, Blackstone  surveyed the wreckage of the S&L/real-estate crisis and decided to establish  a separate entity to get in on the action -- even though Blackstone had no  prior experience in real-estate investing. The company ended up buying  packets of properties, and when the market revived in the latter half of the  1990s, Blackstone sold them off at a staggering profit. Burstein thinks that  the telecom and Internet shakeout of the past two years is an investing  opportunity of similar size and scope. Consider the prevailing wisdom that there is a bandwidth glut. You can read  a thousand research reports on the Internet, and invariably you will find  someone whining about this glut. It is certainly true that the information  superhighways running down the fiber-optic lines between major metropolitan  areas are, for the moment, underutilized. But does that mean that they will  be underutilized in five or seven years? The likely answer to that question: Of course not. Pervasive computing means  that new appliances, new security systems, new HVAC installations in  buildings, whether commercial or residential, will communicate with server  farms to exchange information constantly. Peer-to-peer technology will have  computers talking back and forth to one another, constantly updating  information for millions of end users. Gaming will continue to grow and  become for the echo-boom generation what television was for the baby  boomers. All of these technologies will be added to an ever-growing traffic flow of  email, messaging, searches, and business communications. Enabling all of  this technology will require enormous amounts of bandwidth and gargantuan  amounts of what George Gilder calls ""storewidth"": the response time between  entering a request on the Web and getting back the first page. Bandwidth and  storewidth companies have been hammered over the course of the past 18  months, to the point where they are now selling at relatively reasonable  prices. Like the real-estate glut of the late 1980s, the bandwidth glut of  the early 2000s is almost certainly a temporary phenomenon. So it's not  surprising that major investment houses are scouring the countryside,  looking at Internet-infrastructure companies that will enable the coming of  all of these new technologies. It will take a number of years before we know which investors made the right  bets. The secret of business success is that much of it derives from luck  and timing. But after 18 months of virtually no activity, with huge pools of  investment money sitting on the sidelines in cash accounts, the great game  has quietly restarted. Investment companies are back at the table placing  their bets. And the biggest bets are being wagered in the beleaguered  telecom sector, which makes sense. European telecoms in particular overpaid  for spectrum licenses and, in doing so, jeopardized their franchises. Now  they must sell off key assets to stay afloat. Those assets are selling at a  significant discount. Situations like that attract big money very fast. The next wave will occur in the Internet-infrastructure sector as companies  with strong market positions but weak cash flow hit the wall and grow  desperate. The last wave will be in a whole range of dotcom companies --  especially shopping bots. As peer-to-peer computing advances, shopping bots  will not only be able to find you the best price on any given item, but they  will also give you the ability to auction out your business. Kids need  back-to-school clothes? Bid your business out on the Internet, and the Gap  will have to offer you $1,000 worth of merchandise for $850. If it doesn't,  Target will. Ever since April 14, 2000, the question has been, When is this thing ( the  Internet business, for lack of a better phrase ) going to turn around? The  answer is in that McKinsey survey and in the behavior of some of the world's  leading investors: It's turning around now. If the S&L/real-estate crisis is  a suitable analogy, it'll take about five years to get from here to there.  Along the way, there's lots of money to be made.

"Louise- Any notion of amount of risk bidders are comfy with, both credit and market? I doubt anything specific has been discussed but have any ranges been thrown out. Hope all is well. Happy New Year.

I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.  As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing.   Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart.

Cc:     Lavorato, John  Subject:        Re-start/Integration Planning   We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-  +       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub  +       Development             Jay Webb  +       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster  +       HR                      David Oxley  +       Cash Management Tom Myers  +       Credit                  Debbie Brackett   The rest will be completed shortly.   We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.

GAO Begins New Investigation into Federal Office of Pipeline Safety  --Dingell Request to Investigate Resource and Personnel Needs at OPS  4. Bush Nominates Director for Department of Energy Office of Science  --Raymond Orbach, Chancellor at UC Riverside, is Named  *****************************  APPROPRIATION BILLS WRAPPED UP  When President Bush issued his proposed fiscal year 2002 budget to Congress last April, investment in research and development was not a top priority in most federal agencies.  Eight months and a major terrorist attack later, Congress and the President agreed to put aside their disagreements over funding levels for most federal programs until another day.    Here is a brief summary of how energy and space research programs fared in the recent appropriations cycle.  Information on funding for research programs at the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Defense will appear in Update next week.  Energy  Funding for energy research and development programs are divided between two appropriations bills - Energy & Water and Interior.  The Energy Committee of ASME's Council on Engineering submitted testimony last spring on the energy programs contained in both bills.  Copies of the testimony are available at:  http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-21.html and http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-22.html  The Interior bill provides funding for fossil energy and energy conservation R&D programs.  In its testimony to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the COE Energy Committee recommended several key areas that it believed merited increases above the President's request.   In all of those areas - carbon sequestration, advanced gas turbines, and fuel cell research - Congress ultimately supported the ASME Committee's recommendations.  For carbon sequestration, the President had requested $20.6 million, the ASME Committee had recommended $29.6 million, and Congress ultimately appropriated $32.1 million.  The President had proposed eliminating the advanced gas turbine program; the Committee had recommended that funding be restored to a level of $30 million, $1.1 million more than in FY 2001.  Congress decided on a level of $18.5 million.  For fuel cell research, the administration had proposed $45.1 million, a reduction of $7.2 million from the FY01 level.  The ASME Energy Committee had recommended $61.1 million, and Congress appropriated $58.1, which was higher than either the House or the Senate had recommended in their individual bills.  In the Energy & Water appropriations bill, renewable energy research funding was set at $396 million which, while $40 million less than the Senate bill, was $20 million above the House-passed number, $120 million above the President's request, and $21 million above current levels.  Nuclear Energy Research received $250.5 million, which is $27 million more than the President's request, but $9 million less than current levels.  The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative received $32 million, which is $19.2 million more than the President requested, $15 million more than the House version, but $6 million less than the Senate recommended and $3 million less than the ASME Energy Committee recommendation.  The Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization Program received $7 million, which is $2 million more than the President's request, the House bill, and current levels, but $2 million less than the Senate bill, and $3 million less than the Energy Committee recommended.  DOE science programs were funded at $3.2 billion, an increase of $73.2 million over the budget request and $52.7 million above fiscal year 2001.  High energy physics was funded at the request level of $716.1 million.  Nuclear physics also was funded at the request level of $360.5 million.  Biological and environmental research received $527.4 million, an increase of $84.4 million over the request. Funding for basic energy sciences was set at $1 billion, a decrease of $1 million from the request, although that total includes full funding for the Spallation Neutron Source.  The Advanced Scientific Computing Research Initiative was allocated $158 million, a decrease of $5 million from the request.  Finally, fusion energy research was funded at $248.5 million, the same as the request and the COE Energy Committee recommendation.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  Funding for NASA's R&D programs is included in the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill.  National Science Foundation programs also are included in that bill.  ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal R&D has task forces that prepared testimony on both NASA's and NSF's budget requests.   Copies of the testimony can be found at:  http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-11.html and http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-23.html   Overall, NASA received $10.2 billion for its research programs, which is $343 million, or 3.5 percent, more than it received in FY01.  Of that amount, $1.72 billion is allocated for the International Space Station, which is a $440 million, or 15.2 percent reduction from last year.  Congress is increasingly concerned about cost overruns on the station, and has been highly critical of NASA's management of the project.  Among programs receiving substantial increases were Aero-Space Technology, which received a 12.4 percent ($275 million) increase, for a total of $2.49 billion; and Space Science, which received $2.84 billion, $224 million, or 8.5 percent, more than last year.   MATH AND SCIENCE PARTNERSHIPS AT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND NSF  When President Bush announced his education plan last February, he proposed a Math and Science Partnership Initiative at the National Science Foundation, emphasizing a need for better science and mathematics education across the country.  Possible partners for the Math and Science Partnerships could include the State Education Agency, a math, science, or engineering department of an institution of higher education, a high need Local Education Agency, businesses, and nonprofit and for-profit groups of demonstrated effectiveness.  The House and Senate Education Committees, when drafting their education legislation, also thought the Math and Science Partnership program was needed, but placed the program at the Department of Education.  In the end, now that the authorization and appropriation process is complete, there are programs at both NSF and Department of Education.  The two agencies are in fact forming a task force to address the issue.    The FY 2002 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations conferees only appropriated $12.5 million for the newly-established Math and Science Partnerships at the Department of Education, which were authorized at $450 million in the recently approved Elementary and Secondary Education Authorization Act.  However, the FY 2002 VA/HUD appropriations bill, provided another $160 million for similar partnerships to be awarded by NSF.  In addition, the Labor-HHS-Education conferees encouraged states to continue making science and math instruction a high priority by also using other federal funds available for teacher improvement.  A total of $2.85 billion was appropriated for overall Teacher Quality.     For more information, please contact Patti Burgio at burgiop@asme.org.  GAO BEGINS NEW INVESTIGATION INTO FEDERAL OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY  In response to a request by Representative John Dingell, ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the General Accounting Office has begun another investigation into the Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety, specifically focusing on OPS's approach to preventing terrorist attacks like those of September 11, and whether the OPS has sufficient resources and personnel to deal with such events.  On October 3, GAO released an investigative report on OPS that said the agency had made progress, but still had the lowest rating of any transportation agency in implementing National Transportation Safety Board recommendations.  For more information, contact Francis Dietz at dietzf@asme.org.

"Rick -   As we discussed, I have an outstanding tax liability with the Australian government, and I need your help in this matter.  Working for Enron Ex-Pat Services, I incurred additional tax liabilities which Enron was to pay on my behalf.  In simple terms, Enron agreed to make up the difference between my U.S. income tax liability and that charged by Australia.  My full U.S. tax liability was withheld from my paychecks and Enron was to make up the difference between this and the 48% charged by the Australian government.    As of today, the incremental tax liability has not been addressed by Enron, and I need to resolve this issue immediately.  It appears that the easiest solution is for Enron Corp. to wire Enron Australia the estimated tax liability, with Enron Australia passing the money to the Australian tax authority. I will have the final estimate from PWC first thing Monday morning, but it has been indicated that the liability in total will be less than $50,000 U.S..  I appreciate any help you can provide in getting this matter resolved.  I will provide you the specific estimates Monday morning, and in the interim, if there is anything else you need from me, I am at your disposal.

From a Visor Newbie This little doozy has to be the greatest invention of all time. I just wanted to send you an email and let you know how much I love it! I ordered it on-line before Thanksgiving and got it shortly thereafter.  It's amazing how much information you can have at your fingertips! Two things that I've done with it so far is added my vehicle info to my Memo pad (maintenance records / insurance info) to a category called CARS. (So the next time I take my car in for an oil change and they say, ""When was the last time you replaced your air filter,"" I'll be like, ""Well, funny that you ask because I've got that info right here."" Love that!!  Also, I love the capability to have all of my health insurance info at my fingertips. I made a category on my Memo pad and included info like who my insurance is for dental, health, vision, plus my doctors names, numbers, etc... not to mention that I've got numbers, addresses, and email info for everyone. And that handy little calendar from Outlook that reminds me of stuff-all at my fingertips! I'm just learning about all the capabilities, but so far, I think IT'S FABULOUS! I'm telling everyone I know to get one!  Thanks again! Angela P.

OMB REPORT TARGETS LIST OF AGENCY REGULATIONS The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently published a report that lists federal regulations (including several environmental regulations like the new source review regulations under the Clean Air Act) it believes should be reviewed for possible changes.  The report also compares the cost and benefit of complying with health, safety, and environmental regulations, and proposals to improve the regulatory process. For more information, please contact Kathryn Holmes at holmesk@asme.org.    A DAY AT THE CAPITOL TO BE HELD IN CALIFORNIA  ASME's Region IX will host the 5th Annual Day at the Capitol in Sacramento, California on February 5.   The program will focus on three issues: energy, transportation, and engineering licensing.  Visits will also be scheduled for the participants with Chairman and Ranking Members of the appropriate committees of jurisdiction, as well as some individual visits with Assemblymen and Senators.

DOT PROPOSES RULE TO REDUCE EFFECTS OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINE ACCIDENTS  On January 9 The Department of Transportation published the first portion of a proposed rule aimed at reducing the harmful effects of natural gas pipeline accidents.   DOT's Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), published a note in the Federal Register, to define areas of high consequence where significant or considerable human or property harm would result from a gas transmission pipeline accident.  The proposal is addressing integrity management programs for natural gas pipelines with a two-part rule.  The majority of the rule should be published sometime later this year. Integrity management refers to the periodic inspection, testing, and repair of all pipeline segments that could affect high consequence areas.   RSPA's philosophy toward gas pipelines builds on current class location regulations that require the operator to know what people would be affected by a pipeline rupture.  The agency's primary goal is to protect highly populated areas from a gas release.  Public comment on the proposed rule will be accepted until March 11, 2002.  For information, contact Francis Dietz at dietzf@asme.org.   APPROPRIATIONS WRAP UP CONTINUED  Last week, R&D funding at the Department of Energy and NASA were detailed.  This month, the highlights of the FY2002 National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Department of Defense (DOD) budgets are summarized.   National Science Foundation  The NSF Task Force, of ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal Research and Development, provided testimony to the appropriate House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees.  The testimony can be found at: http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-23.html In addition, ASME joined 80 engineering, scientific and professional societies; corporations; and universities in asking Congress for a 15 percent increase in the NSF budget for FY 2002, which would continue the momentum toward doubling the agency's budget by 2006.    In the end, Congress increased NSF's budget 8.4 percent ($373 million) to $4.8 billion, still significantly more than the 1.3 percent that had been requested by the Administration.  Of the total budget,  $3.6 billion will be allocated to the Research and Related Activities (RRA) budget line, an increase of 7.6 percent, or $256 million.  Within the RRA budget, engineering programs will receive $468 million (8.5 percent), a significant boost over the President's request of $431 million.   Department of Defense (DOD)   For the second year in a row, the DOD Task Force, of ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal R&D, delivered oral testimony before the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees.  Copies of the testimony can be found at: http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-16.html  Basic Research and Applied Research, which provide a significant share of federal support for several key science and engineering disciplines, both received significant increases in funding.  Basic Research increased 5.5 percent to $1.389 billion, while Applied Research increased 12.5 percent ($459 million) to $4.135 billion.  The Advanced Technology Development line of the budget increased 11.4 percent ($457 million), for a total of $4.456 billion.   National Institute of Standards and Technology  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Task Force, of ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal R&D, provided written testimony on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2002 appropriation to the appropriate House and Senate Appropriation Subcommittees.  Copies of the testimony can be found at: http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-10.html   The Advanced Technology program, which provides matching grants to corporations to fund high-risk research, was increased 26.9 percent ($39.1 million), for a total of $184.5 million in new funds.  Combined with carryover funds from last fiscal year, the program will have $217.6 million in fiscal year 2002.  While the administration had attempted to suspend the ATP program unsuccessfully, it requested a significant increase (11.3 percent) for the Scientific and Technical Research and Services (STRS) budget, which funds the NIST in-house laboratories and the Baldridge National Quality program.  In the final bill, Congress provided only a 2.9 percent ($9.2 million) increase for this budget, for a total of $321.1 million.   ***************************** Melissa R.

"PVRC'S WORKSHOP ON TIGHTNESS-BASED BOLTED FLANGE  GASKET CONSTANTS AND DESIGN RULES  February 6 & 7, 2002, Safety Harbor Florida   REGISTER NOW AND WATCH FOR FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PVRC'S WEBSITE AT WWW.FORENGINEERS.ORG  Description  You must attend this workshop to help keep your job knowledge useful by understanding the new design rules for bolted flanged joints! Are you ready for the New Tightness-Based Gasket constants and flange design changes that are about to replace the traditional constants and rules?  This workshop will get you ready with focus on three critical areas that apply to both ASME Section VIII flanges and standard B16 Joints.  The New Tightness-Based Rules Gasket Qualification and Selection Latest On Analysis and Assembly of Bolted Joints  This Two-Day Workshop is a ""must"" for those needing  advance information and know-how about applying the recently developed gasket constants and flange design rules. The tightness-based rules accommodate levels of permissible joint leakage, representing a new basis for design criteria and opening additional choices and decisions for users and designers.    Attendees will gain detailed knowledge about several topics focussing on the new gasket constants and design rules and particularly on issues relating to leakage criteria and associated choices.  The tightness concept is also extended to elevated temperature gasket qualification and selection, and know-how for efficient joint assembly and making zero leakage plant operation a realistic goal is presented.  Several industry experts will lead workshop sessions including: Bob Mikitka, Jim Payne, Michel Derenne, Yves Birembaut, Ron winter, Jerry Waterland, Rod Mueller, Anita Bausman, Jim Frew Hildegarde Zeres, Warren Brown, Ed Hayman, Bill Koves, and David Reeves.

In Day View, just tap New, then tap Floating Event from the popup menu, and enter the name of the event. Your new floating event will appear as a circle on your Day View until you delete it.   <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>  Write Stuff Many of us keep in touch with the office when we're ""on the road"", but e-newsletter subscriber Cynthia takes it to a whole new level!  Biking Cross-Country with My Visor Handheld I'm a partner for a graphic design firm. Taking three months off to bicycle from Washington, DC, to Florence, Oregon, would put a strain on the company. But my partner and our staff had given me their ""you go, girl"" blessing. They even built a special section of our corporate web site to highlight the trip: (http://www.gravesfowler.com/noteworthy/beyond.html <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2182.10968.42943.4688.233.34125625>). The plan was to post our journal as we moved across the country. It was a beautiful design; now the pressure was on for me to do the writing and get it back to them.  That's where my Visor came in. With a collapsible keyboard and modem module, we had a lightweight package of technology that would fit into my bag and keep us connected. We also carried a backup module to insure we wouldn't lose data when batteries ran low and we were miles from a store. I learned to set up my traveling office on picnic tables, in our tent, on diner tables surrounded by pancakes and eggs, in country churches and steamy laundromats. We stayed in a motel once a week and hooked up the modem to send the week's entries back home.    We also collected email messages from folks who were following our progress. As the weeks and miles added up, we realized through this connection how many people were rooting for us and following our unfolding story.    <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>   <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0082/final/images/011502biking.jpg>    <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>  We feel lucky to have lived out a long time dream. Now in the middle of winter, I sometimes open my Visor, click back to a random summer day and savor the memories.

"Any suggestions on how you want RAC to administer this policy?   -----Original Message----- From:  Bouillion, James L.   Sent: Tuesday, January 15, 2002 9:46 AM To: McMahon, Jeffrey Cc: Bradford, William S. Subject: RE: Counterparty Credit Insurance.  Jeff, please see my earlier e-mail today.  When I sent the first e-mail, we were going to own 49% of the trading Newco  I understand from the press, we will have no ownership under the UBS deal.   Therefore,  the policy will continue to protect against Counter-party defaults on those portions of the portfolio that we are retaining.  At some point we should advise insurers on the changes in ownership and the status of the portfolio as these would be ""material changes "" to what was originally underwritten.   Bill Bradford is wanting someone to assume responsibility for ""administration and reporting"" under the policy.  To whom would you want to delegate this responsibility.  Bill Bradford's group produced the required quarterly reports and Bill was working on the PG&E claim.  Please advise.    -----Original Message----- From:  McMahon, Jeffrey   Sent: Tuesday, January 15, 2002 8:11 AM To: Bouillion, James L.; Deffner, Joseph Cc: Hodge, Jeffrey T.; Bowen Jr., Raymond; Bradford, William S.

I received a voice mail from Bill Bradford advising that you should be made aware of this issue as it is uncertain as to where Bill will reside as a result of the sale of the trading operations.  Please provide your thoughts.   -----Original Message----- From:  Bouillion, James L.   Sent: Friday, January 11, 2002 7:49 AM To: Hodge, Jeffrey T. Cc: Bradford, William S.; Bowen Jr., Raymond Subject: Counterparty Credit Insurance.  The sale of the trading operation creates an issue with the ""coverage"" and  ""named insured"" wording on this policy, which must be addressed with the underwriters.  The change in ownership alone has a material underwriting effect which requires notice and discussion with insurers.    Enron will own only 49% of the trading going forward and the policy covers 100% of the counter-party credit exposure.  The new owner and entity are not insureds.  Would we want to approach underwriters with the request to continue the coverage for 100% and include the new owners and new entity as an insured or would we want to retain the coverage only for Enron's 49% exposure?  This is further complicated by the fact that the premium invested in the ""finite layer"" belongs to Enron and there are potential claims lodged against the program.  I don't have a current estimate on the PG&E exposure, however, depending on what is recovered from PG&E,  it could impact the first two layers of the insurance.  The Chubb layer (second layer) also has Directors and Officers Liability coverage included and it is exposed to current litigation. Due to the $100,000,000, aggregate in the Chubb Layer, it would provide additional coverage for both Credit and D&O going forward.  We need to meet and discuss.

"Janet - thanks for your note. Following are my thoughts. First, I am not going to Netco. (Long story). Second, I have spoken with Ken Lay and Jeff McMahon about the continuation of RAC and my leading it. They both want RAC to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with RAC as well (to be determined more definitively).   Jim has also requested that some RAC folks be near his operation as you have which I totally understand. I think I will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28. We have counterparty credit files on 15,000 counterparties as well as Dash libraries and other info that require large secure space.  My final issue is that I have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical. I need to get Netco people away from 28 and get remaining RAC people sitting together and feeling like a team. Everyone is looking and the market is hot for our credit and market risk people.   I hope this addresses your issue.  Rick    -----Original Message----- From:  Dietrich, Janet   Sent: Friday, January 18, 2002 8:37 AM To: Buy, Rick Subject: People   Hi Rick. Hope your holding up. We are going to have all of the ""on-going concern"" activities here in the old building on the 30-31-32 floors. We will be splitting the estate infrastructure into two functions: on-going activities (contracts/assets we will continue to serve and perform under) and wind-up/liquidation activities. Jim Fallon will be managing the latter function and I believe he is staying in the new building for now.  We need to ensure that we have the appropriate folks from RAC engaged in the on-going concern function.

We need to have highly-skilled folks in the RAC/audit functions supporting this business.      -----Original Message----- From:  Buy, Rick   Sent: Friday, January 18, 2002 9:37 AM To: Dietrich, Janet Cc: Fallon, Jim; McMahon, Jeffrey; Bowen Jr., Raymond; Gorte, David Subject: RE: People   Janet - thanks for your note.

Health, defense and counter-terrorism related research show the biggest gains.  For more information, see:  http://xserver.aaas.org/news/fedsupport.html  OMB ISSUES INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS TO AGENCIES The Office of Management and Budget has issued guidelines to federal agencies to add information quality standards to the procedural requirements agencies must meet with regard to their disseminated information.  The agencies can be sued if information agencies disseminate or use to develop regulations, fails to meet OMB's standards. At least 50 federal offices are covered by OMB's guidelines, including: the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House, the Department of Defense, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  For more information, contact Kathryn Holmes at holmesk@asme.org.    STATE OF TECHNOLOGY IN MARYLAND TO BE HELD IN ANNAPOLIS  ASME will join with the Technology Council of Maryland in co-sponsoring an annual gathering of Maryland lawmakers and industry leaders to discuss technology-based economic development.  This year's program will feature technology-based entrepreneurship.  Hear about challenges, accomplishments and opportunities from successful Maryland technology start-ups as well as examine how schools and universities are preparing future engineering, science and technology entrepreneurs.   The summit will be held in Annapolis on February 4.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING SEES FUNDING INCREASE  Congress increased the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)'s budget from its $2 million start-up funding in FY2001 to $40 million for FY2002, plus an additional $72 million in existing imaging and biomedical funding transferred to NIBIB from other national health institutes.  In report language, a nine-member extramural task force was called for to review bioengineering and imaging projects throughout the National Institutes of Health.    For more information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.   PRESIDENT SIGNS BROWNFIELDS LEGISLATION  Last week, President Bush signed legislation aimed at boosting clean up of brownfields, abandoned or underutilized industrial or commercial properties.  Redevelopment of these properties is hindered by possible environmental contamination and potential liability.  The bill provides liability protection for contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, and innocent landowners and authorizes increased funding for state and local programs that assess and clean up brownfields.  The legislation had bipartisan support.  The President also announced that his FY 03 budget will double the funds available through the EPA for FY02, to help states and communities around the country clean up and revitalize these sites.   Urban redevelopment and brownfields cleanup also will be funded at a level of $25 million through the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

"   Dear Colleague,   Recent market events demonstrate how important it is for market participants to enact an effective and efficient assessment of counterparty credit risk. Over the past calendar year we have seen unprecedented deterioration of credit quality from some of the world's largest energy firms. As a result, many market participants have suffered significant credit losses, which have directly impacted their profitability and shareholder value. Moreover, it often took weeks or months for many of the affected firms to know the total amount of their exposure to these troubled energy companies.   Over the past five years Algorithmics has been working with energy companies to solve these problems. Algo Energy <http://www.algorithmics.com/solns/algoenergy/index.shtml> enables firms to quickly analyze the risk of their portfolios and find answers to key questions. Specifically:      What is the value of the transactions I have with the counterparty and what is my potential loss in case of default?  How many affiliated entities are we trading with and what is the overall exposure?  How are the agreements in place going to offset the transaction exposures and reduce this potential loss?  What is the state of all posted collateral and guarantees and how does it mitigate my potential losses?  What is my exposure to other counterparties that share similar characteristics or are exposed to the same troubled counterparty?  How will these exposures change if market conditions change?   Today, some companies are answering these questions proactively and allocating capital appropriately. They know the risks they are taking and they are managing their exposures to leveraged counterparties carefully. In the event of market downturn, they reduce their exposures before credit deterioration happens.  Many of these companies are able to do so as a result of Algo Energy, Algorithmics' comprehensive risk management solution for energy markets.     Algo Energy helps a firm manage the complex interaction between market, credit, and liquidity risk. At the core of Algo Energy is a sophisticated risk engine that applies market leading valuation methodologies to all the physical and financial deals booked against a firm's counterparties, across all energy markets and using all plausible scenarios. This methodology allows a firm to establish how counterparty exposures will evolve over time and over scenarios and assess how market factors effect the credit quality of counterparties. Only through a scenario- based methodology can these interactions be computed efficiently and accurately at the enterprise level.   Further, by applying netting agreements imbedded in complex counterparty structures, Algo Energy allows a firm to monitor and manage actual and potential exposures against counterparty limits structures, while taking into account the proper valuation of collateral and roll-off risk. Algo Energy, allows a firm to manage the various states of collateral agreements. By monitoring the agreement's threshold schedule (among other factors), the system identifies changes in obligations of the firm's counterparty due to changes in the firm's credit rating. The system in turn directs real-time states of agreements to assigned relationship managers or operation managers for active collateral management.   Building on the award winning Mark-to-Future technology, Algo Energy helps a firm to manage their risk pro-actively. It provides transparency, flexibility and scalability at the enterprise level. This state-of-the-art technology is delivered in a distributed framework for the enterprise. Computed once, the same exposure calculations can be analyzed at either the desk level or the enterprise risk level, ensuring consistency in reporting and data quality. The distributed framework also ensures that the system is scalable and flexible to support the growing needs of the enterprise.   Algorithmics is a world leader in enterprise risk management solutions. Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, with 15 offices and over 500 employees worldwide, Algorithmics has the largest number of dedicated risk management professionals under one roof. The Algorithmics energy risk team, located in our New York City and Toronto offices, would be happy to provide further information about our energy risk products and services. To reach us, call 212-625-5260 (New York) or +1 416-217-1500 (Toronto), to speak to one of our energy risk professionals.

For her birthday last July I gave her a Visor handheld and she has found several wonderful uses for it in her third grade classroom. For my birthday in August she in turn purchased a Visor for me.  At that time Jenny was 5 months pregnant and I was looking for programs that could help keep track of our busy lives as well as help us keep track of the pending event. I used the Memo Pad to keep tabs on things we already had and items we still needed to pack for the hospital.  I eventually found a program online called Labor Timer. It is so simple to use. All you do is push the on-screen Start or Stop button and it automatically calculates the start time of the contraction, the length of the contraction and the time between each contraction. We used it to practice so that I could work on my coaching techniques as we were planning a natural drug-free delivery.  On Christmas Day Jenny started having contractions. We used her Visor and the Labor Timer to monitor the contractions but that was not to be the day. Again on the 29th she had contractions and again no baby. However, throughout the day on New Years Eve her contractions were very consistent. That night after we rang in the New Year she felt very strongly that this might be the night. As I went to sleep Jenny used her Visor and the Labor Timer to keep track of her contractions. At 4 a.m. she said it was time to head for the hospital. Throughout the wee hours of the morning I used my Visor Edge to keep track of the contractions as we paced the halls of the hospital. The staff was impressed at how I was able to keep such accurate details as we roamed up and down the halls of Labor and Delivery. I fessed up and showed them the program running on my Visor. At 12:51 p.m. January 1st our daughter Zoe Grace was born. I am happy to report Mom, Zoe and Dad are all doing great.  Now I can use the financial calculator to plan for her college tuition and I'll need to get an eyemodule to take pictures for e-mailing and...

Whenever your children are out of control, you can take  comfort from the thought that even God's omnipotence did not  extend to His own children. After creating heaven and earth,  God created Adam and Eve.  And the first  thing he said was, ""Don't.""  ""Don't what ?"" Adam replied.  ""Don't eat the forbidden fruit."" God said.  ""Forbidden fruit? We have forbidden fruit?  Hey, Eve ... we have forbidden fruit !""  ""No way !""  ""Yes, way !""  ""Do NOT eat the fruit !"" said God.  ""Why ?""  ""Because I am your Father and I said so !"" God replied, (wondering why  he hadn't stopped creation after making the elephants).  A few minutes later, God saw His children having an apple break and was  He ticked!  ""Didn't I tell you not to eat the fruit ?""  God, as our first parent, asked.  ""Uh huh,"" Adam replied.  ""Then why did you?"" said the Father.  ""I don't know,"" said Eve.  ""She started it !"" Adam said,  ""Did not !""  ""Did too !""  ""DID NOT !""  Having had it with the two of them, God's punishment was that Adam and  Eve should have children of their own. Thus, the pattern was set and it has  never changed!  But there is reassurance in this story. If you have persistently and  lovingly tried to give children wisdom and they haven't taken it, don't  be hard on yourself. If God had trouble raising children, what makes you  think it would be a piece of cake for you?   Advice for the day:  If you have a lot of tension and you get a headache, do what it says on  the aspirin bottle: ""Take two Aspirin"" and ""Keep away from children.""   A FEW ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS ! ...  CHILDREN: You spend the first 2 years of their life teaching  them to  walk and talk. Then you spend the next 16 telling  them to sit down and  shut-up.   -Grandchildren are God's reward for not killing your children.  -Mothers of teens know why some animals eat their young.  -Children seldom misquote you. In fact, they usually repeat word for word  what you shouldn't have said.  -The main purpose of holding children's parties is to remind yourself  that there are children more awful than your own.  -We child proofed our home 3 years ago and they're still getting in!

Audioconferencing just might be your solution. But, audioconferencing isn't always as simple as it seems. Consider the following tips when you pick up the phone for that next meeting.   Leader   Pick an appropriate time for the meeting. Avoid lunchtime hours, if possible.  Be prompt and end on time.  Conduct a roll call.  For large audiences, use Listen Only mode, which mutes all participants until they're queued to talk. Also use an attended service level, which offers a conference coordinator to help manage the call.  To share a PowerPoint presentation, use Net Conferencing. Participants view the presentation on the Web while listening to you on an audioconference. You control the pace of the presentation and it ensures that participants don't jump ahead.  If a follow-up meeting is required, select a mutual time and date before the call is over. Follow-up via e-mail.   Leader & Participants   Speak clearly and avoid outside conversations or background noise.  Identify yourself by name when speaking and address other individuals by name.  Use your voice effectively; vary the tone and pace.  Use the mute button if you are not speaking. If you do not have access to a mute button, press *6 on your telephone keypad to mute and unmute yourself.   Receive a Free Web RSVP! Effective February 1, schedule a domestic attended-level audioconference or Net conference, add Instant Replay PlusSM, and you'll receive a free Web RSVP -- up to $100!* Instant Replay Plus allows individuals who missed your meeting access to a digital recording that they can listen to at their convenience.

(See Tim's note below) 2) I spoke to Ray by telephone(on his way to the airport) regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering. 3) To paraphrase Ray's comments to my note below, a) he is working with the creditors' committee on the D&O issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the on-going business.  At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in mid-February.  b) the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today.  As a non-debtor we plan to honor the agreements, but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place.  4) With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court. 4) Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP.  The hearing date will be in mid-February. 5) Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow ""form of agreement"".  This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing.  However, BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening.  6) THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT, BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW.  A COPY IS ATTACHED.  WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR (John Ambler & Johan Zaayman) and the working group and now the two of you.  Do we need to send it elsewhere?     We'll circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents.  If you have any questions or comments please contact Tim, Stephen or I.  jeff   -----Original Message----- From:  Sherrick, Jeffrey   Sent: Tuesday, January 22, 2002 1:54 PM To: Bowen Jr., Raymond Subject: FW: EOGIL  With respect to the note below,  we have done the following this morning.   1) We have provided Mary Jean Potenzone with Weil samples of the documents for her review.  There are a couple of different documents (Retention agreements & divestiture agreements) and the only differences being names and amounts.  We have also sent her any associated agreements, extensions and assignment.  She indicated she would review this afternoon.  My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank.    2) None of the people on this list participated in the pre-petition retention Lilly has asked about.  Futhermore, none of these people are part of the future plan (if there is one) to the best of my knowledge.  3) On D&O, supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors' see the need for such a plan but they don't want a one off plan as well.  It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines.    4)  Once we have the compensation and the D&O issue resolved, we can notify BG and sign this deal.  I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues (ok on bonuses & letter in lieu of D&O policy) if you can.  5) Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion, they are just creditor committee issues.  jeff   -----Original Message----- From:  Detmering, Tim   Sent: Tuesday, January 22, 2002 1:24 PM To: Bowen Jr., Raymond; Brian Rosen (E-mail); Steve Zelin (E-mail) Cc: Wallace, Stephen; Davis, Steve; Sherrick, Jeffrey; Harper, Stephen Subject: EOGIL  Just spoke with Lilly Chu at Houlihan.  The Creditor's Committee is fine with the transaction with the following reservations:  1)  Escrow the proceeds  2)  D&O insurance will be addressed in the future   3)  Ray needs to get back with Lilly and clarify the deal compensation arrangements for EGEP personnel including providing employment agreements to Milbank.  Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once, i.e., people who got a piece of the pre-petition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan.  4)  EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor.  I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenroht's mistake.  ( I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time.)   Therefore, the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds, does not provide for separate D&O insurance and does not address the deal compensation.",rick.buy@enron.com,paula.rieker@enron.com,FW: EOGIL sale to BG,2002-01-23 15:59:24-08:00,received

Terrorism Reinsurance Legislation Re-emerging    -Efforts at Federal and State Level    *****************************  CONGRESS BACK IN SESSION  This week Congress returned to face a tough election year agenda on issues such as the economy, energy, trade and campaign finance.  The ability of both parties will be tested to overcome fierce partisan battles that stalled action last year.   President Bush will help set the tone with Congress in his State of the Union address next Tuesday night, where lawmakers will watch to see if he outlines a confrontational or cooperative approach to key issues such as taxes and spending. More information about the Congressional agenda can be found at:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21833-2002Jan22.html For further information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.   PRESIDENT BUSH TO RELEASE BUDGET FEBRARY 4 While President Bush does not send his $2 trillion FY2003 budget to Congress until February 4, the Administration and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office severely downgraded their surplus forecasts this week. While President Bush's budget will propose big boosts for defense and homeland security and a renewed drive for an economic stimulus bill, Bush will propose budgets cuts in the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Interior and Labor as well as Army Corps of Engineers' water projects.  Only a small overall increase for most remaining federal programs will be proposed.  Also projects such as the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and Advanced Technology are slated to be eliminated in the Bush FY2003 budget. A recent article on the surplus forecast and the upcoming budget can be found at: http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20020124/ap_on_go_pr_wh/budget_19&cid=536 For more information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.   ICCFR&D MEETING TO ADDRESS BUSH FY2003 BUDGET  ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal R&D (ICCFRD) of the Council on Engineering (COE) will meet February 13-14, 2002 in Washington, D.C., the week following the President's budget request for FY2003. The ICCFR&D provides the mechanical engineering profession with a voice in the federal R&D budget process that incorporates the industrial and academic perspectives, the interaction of R&D and engineering education, and changing societal needs.  Task Force Chairmen will participate in providing an analysis for their issue area of the President's FY2003 budget, which will be released to the Congress in early February 2002. That analysis will be used as ASME's contribution to an annual report prepared by the American Association for the Advancement of Science on research and development in the federal budget. In addition, the analysis will be used to prepare written or oral testimony on the agency budgets for Congressional hearings and for other purposes.    For more information, please contact Reese Meisinger at meisingerr@asme.org.    A DAY AT THE CAPITOL TO BE HELD IN CALIFORNIA  ASME's Region IX will host the 5th Annual Day at the Capitol in Sacramento, California on February 5.   The program will focus on three issues: energy, transportation, and engineering licensing.  Visits will also be scheduled for the participants with Chairmen and Ranking Members of the appropriate committees of jurisdiction, as well as some individual visits with Assemblymen and Senators.    For program and registration details, go to http://www.asme.org/gric Additional information is available from Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.   EPA ADDRESSING POWER PLANTS EMISSIONS A legislative plan to control power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury will be released no later than mid-February by the Environmental Protection Agency, answering a request by the Bush Administration's National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG).  Around that time, the Senate is scheduled to begin action on competing legislation by Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman, James Jeffords (I-VT).   The two proposals is provision differ on strategies for controlling carbon dioxide.  The EPA legislation is not expected to contain such a provision; NEPDG had specified that the reductions be phased in and that EPA develop market-based incentives to assist utilities in complying.  An official from the Agency said the regulated community could save 25 percent to 30 percent more than the current regulatory structure, due to new technologies and greater flexibility for meeting environmental targets.  Information about Jeffords' legislation, S. 556, can be found at:  http://thomas.loc.gov More information can be found on the agency's web site in mid-February at http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/emissions/index.html For more information, contact Kathryn Holmes at holmesk@asme.org.    COUNCIL ON BIOETHICS NAMED  President Bush has appointed an 18-member Council of Bioethics to address some of the more controversial aspects of the biotechnology field.  Last week the council held its first two-day meeting in Washington, D.C., which focused on human cloning as its first issue.   The Council will consider a range of bioethical matters connected with specific biomedical and technological activities, such as embryo and stem cell research, assisted reproduction, cloning, uses of knowledge and techniques derived from human genetics or the neurosciences, and end-of-life issues. Broader ethical and social issues, such as the appropriate uses of biomedical technologies and the protection of human subjects in research, may also be considered. A list and description of the Council members is available from the following White House press release: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020116-9.html For more information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.   TERRORISM REINSURANCE LEGISLATION RE-EMERGING  Last week leadership from the Financial Services Roundtable, a group comprised of top executives with 100 large banking, insurance, and investment companies, met with President Bush and other top Administration officials to discuss its Congressional agenda, which includes enactment of a federal terrorism reinsurance bill.    The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3210 on November 29, 2001.  The bill addresses key issues affecting civil litigation arising out of future terrorist attacks.  The bill currently awaits Senate consideration.   H.R.3210 would bar punitive damages, non-economic damages in excess of the defendant's direct proportion of responsibility for the plaintiff's physical harm, and suits against companies, building owners, security firms, or other businesses on the grounds that those entities were negligent and failed to protect people against attack, while capping attorney fees.   The House Financial Services Committee will be examining the economic impacts of the failure to enact terrorism reinsurance legislation.  More information about the hearing can be found at its web site at http://www.house.gov/financialservices/  States debating similar types of legislation are Alabama, California, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and West Virginia.

(For t= hose who may not know, smokejumpers are airborne, forest fire fighters that=  parachute into remote mountainous terrain to fight wild fires). As a Forem= an for the Missoula Smokejumpers I manage several programs and coordinate s= everal projects. My Visor helps me to stay on top of all that administrativ= e work; but more unique is how it helps me on fires. My Prism was particula= rly helpful on one fire this last summer.  =09   <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0090/final/images/012802parachute.= jpg>We had a late afternoon dispatch to the Gallatin National Forest just n= orth of Yellowstone National Park in early August-another lightning ignited=  fire. We were flying over the scene about one hour after receiving the cal= l. As the airplane circled the fire I noticed a couple of small spot fires = quite a distance from the main fire. I had my Prism out with the Magellan G= PS <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=3D141.2342.11693.46460.5128.233.34125= 625> Module installed so I quickly marked a couple of waypoints as we flew = over the spots. Within a few minutes we were leaping out of the aircraft an= d floating down to our jump spot about a half mile from the fire. Unfortuna= tely one of our fellow crewmembers was hurt on landing, and because no heli= copter ambulances were available in the area, we were forced to utilize the=  Malmstrom Air Force air rescue helicopter about four hours away. With my P= rism and GPS unit I was able to gather the latitude and longitude coordinat= es of our location. I had the phone number for the 40th Air Rescue Squadron=  in my address book and thus was able to call them up direct on our satelli= te phone and arrange for the evacuation of the injured jumper-giving them a= ll the pertinent information, including our location. =09 The next day I grabbed pictures of the fire with my eyemodule2 <http://r.4a= t1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=3D141.2342.11693.46460.5129.233.34125625>. The fire = made some impressive runs as the day warmed up making for some dandy photo = opportunities but making for tough firefighting. Luckily, with some fast ac= tion and hard work on our part, we were able to get the fire under control = as the evening cooled. The pictures I captured with the eyemodule2 helped t= o make a very complete fire report at the end of the fire.  The next morning (Day 3) I again used the GPS. We had been unable to find t= he spots we'd seen from the airplane by gridding for them, as they were no = longer showing any smoke. However, I was able to locate the spot fires that=  I had marked as waypoints from the air. And it was a good thing too! Two o= f the spots still had hot embers in them, and thus had potential to kick up=  and burn.  Well, as you can see, a Handspring Visor Prism can be a pretty useful tool,=  even in some pretty unlikely places. All that, and I could even play Solit= aire when we got a chance to kick back and take a break!!
