"John, the attached is a summary by Greg of the financining for the turbines  purchased from New Brunswick Power.  In summary, ECC pays the bank, West LB directly in three installments under  an off-balance sheet lease financing arrangement.  The first installment of  $US 9MM was made Dec. 1/99.  The next installment is due Feb. 1/00 of $US  8MM, and the third installment is due roughly March 31/00 of $US 8MM. The  ""drag"" on the financing is that West LB through whom ENA structures its  off-balance sheet turbine financings is not a Canadian resident for tax  purposes, and therefore is not tax efficient to ECC in that there is a 15%  withholding tax payment on the interest (not principal) component of each  lease/financing payment.  An off-balance sheet financing with a Canadian  resident financial institution would eliminate this tax inefficiency, and  this is what I was referring to when I indicated some work may still be  required to restructure the turbine financing.  The withholding tax if we  keep this structure will total roughly C$ 500,000 over all of the  lease/financing payments (Chris Calger has the exact figure).  Any decision  to change the structure should have regard to these costs and the transaction  costs and fees associated with finding a new Canadian resident off-balance  sheet lender.  In addition, if we decide to keep the turbines, or sell or  transfer the turbines to ENA or a third party (depending on commercially what  it is we decide to do with them), additional work may be required to take  title to the turbines, or to assign/restructure the West LB financing and the  New Brunswick Power purchase agreement.  I am confident that the bulk of  commercial legal work for any of these transactions can be handled  internally, but that the tax legal work may require the input of outside  counsel.  We are also obligated to pay GST, but this is ultimately reimbursed through  the lease financing (althoguh there is a time value of money component that  is not recovered from the time GST is paid and when the GST rebate is made). ---------------------- Forwarded by Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT on 01/26/2000 10:20  AM ---------------------------   Greg Johnston 01/25/2000 05:22 PM To: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Eric LeDain/CAL/ECT@ECT  Subject: WestLB Transaction  Peter, referring to your request for an update as to the status and mechanics  of the West LB transaction relating to our acquisition of the NB Power  turbines, please be advised as follows:  1.  Although ENA executed the Acquisition and Development Agreement (the  ""Agreement"") with WestLB, all of ENA's interest in that Agreement was  immediately assigned to Enron Canada, meaning that we are directly  responsible for making all funding requests and all cost of borrowing  payments to WestLB.  2.  The initial payment on the turbines was made through WestLB for an amount  of US$9,000,000 on December 1, 1999.  GST was payable on US$5,000,000 of that  amount.  3.  The next installment is due to NB Power on February 1, 2000 and is for an  amount of US$8,000,000.  Laura Scott will be initiating the funding request  in the next day or so to allow the advance to be a LIBOR advance.  WestLB  will then attend to paying the installment payment (plus GST) to NB Power on  Feb 1.  4.  The final installment payment is for an amount of US$8,000,000 and is due  on the earlier of the date on which we commence disassembling the turbines  and March 31, 2000.  5.  The cost to Enron Canada for utilizing WestLB, who is not registered in  Canada to carry on business, is that we are required to pay withholding tax  of 15% on all costs of borrowing (ie. interest payments).  The interest is  calculated at a LIBOR rate.  6.  WestLB has now registered themselves in Canada for GST purposes and will  be making the required GST payments to NB Power and then applying for the GST  rebate, which rebate amount is for our account under the Agreement.  7.  WestLB is aware that, depending on how we proceed with our required use  of the turbines, they will be taken out either with respect to (i) the  interim financing or, if the interim financing period is short (ie. if we  were going to proceed immediately to finish paying for the turbines and  commence moving them), (ii) when we put the SPV in place to build the  project.    8.  If we determine that the turbines are to go to Houston and be moved into  the US, the withholding tax issue obviously disappears.  If we determine to  proceed with the project in some fashion but the interim financing period  will be more than a month or so, it probably makes sense to remove WestLB  from the interim financing, thereby saving ourselves the cost of the  withholding tax.  One potential fix is to bring in a Canadian bank to act as  funding agent, with WestLB continuing to bear the transactional risk, which  could reduce the cost to us of getting a new bank comfortable with the  financing arrangement.  We have not yet canvassed all the possible solutions,  so I have not thought through to the full extent whether this proposal is  viable.  I think that you are aware of the reasons that the determination was made to  proceed with WestLB despite the withholding tax issue, but if you would like  to discuss this any further or if there is anything else you would like to  discuss, I am happy to do so.

I squeezed Ken Yewell in our office for your e-mal address.  Thanks./Lonnie (TransAlta)   PPA's -  John, yes you are right the negative bids will not be paid out as a lump sum (credit issues), they will be paid out on a simple flat monthly basis ( I suppose you could use this cash flow to finance a purchase of positive bid plants,  of course you would need to incorporate the appropriate discounting).  Even without the alternative of taking the money and running, you can still use the purchase of a negative value plant as a call option on the market - the premium is the 3 month penalty payment outlined in the auction process.  The company, Charles River Associates, has helped develop this wonderful system (Maybe that's why their stock price has dropped 30% in the past week - actually its earnings related, but who really knows).  The auction was also developed by a group going by the name ""Auction Design Inc"" I think.  With the 13 or so PPA's and with a portion being negative we should have a very interesting auction in the first week of July.  My understanding is that the Minister has the unilateral right to declare the auction a success or failure even if only 50% of the plants are bid.  To date there has been considerable thinking around the issue of what do you do if the plants don't get auctioned off, but I haven't heard anything concrete on solutions.  I assume that if it's close the Minister will be forced to declare it a success politically and then try for some re-auction for the remaining plants and throw the rest into the balancing pool - or some hybrid of that.  In reality it should be very easy to declare the auction a success, even if one $400 million plant gets auctioned off the balancing pool will look positive - the rest of the plants could then be auctioned in smaller annual bits and the balancing pool would be used to ""balance"" the cash flows to the owners.  If the balancing pool becomes negative - the DOE could add a surcharge on EAL's tariffs and if positive - could send the cash into general revenues.  Wish you luck - and when you win one of these I will forward to you the 5 techniques for gaming a pool.

From:  Peter Keohane @ ECT                           06/22/2000 01:05 PM    Sent by: Nella Cappelletto@ECT To: Derek Davies/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey T  Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Hemstock/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mark Powell/CAL/ECT@ECT   Subject: Alberta Power Purchase Arrangement Auction  I have considered on a preliminary basis the potential use of a limited  liability subsidiary of Enron Canada Corp. for the purposes of bidding on the  PPAs.  The issues and preliminary answers are in summary the following:  1. It is not clear that Alberta would permit qualification of another Enron  Canada entity at this point.  I believe that it would be more sellable if  that Enron Canada entity was a replacement to Enron Canada as a Qualified  Bidder, rather than an additional Qualified Bidder, and if that Enron Canada  entity was similarly guaranteed by Enron Corp.  I need to discuss this matter  further with Rob Hemstock, Alberta and Charles River.  2. With respect to the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as mentioned, it is not free  from doubt, but I believe that the Guarantee is only in respect of bidding  on, and paying for a PPA and not for ongoing performance or payment  obligations under the PPA.  In other words, the Guarantee guarantees  ""Obligations"" which relate to the bidding process and not to the PPAs  themselves, although there is some wording which could be viewed as including  in ""Obligations"" ongoing obligations with respect to the PPAs themselves.  3. With respect to limiting liability, such Enron Canada entity would limit  exposure for a successfully acquired PPA to the contributed capital to such  Enron Canada entity, assuming the Enron Corp. Guarantee would not extend past  the bidding process as noted in paragraph 2 above, and subject to the common  law relating to ""piercing the corporate veil"", which in essence means that  the limited liability protection of a shareholder through a corporate entity  can be looked through if the courts determine that the corporate entity was  established merely for the purposes of avoiding liabilities properly  attributable to the shareholder.  Although this is a difficult test to prove  given the intended purposes of corporate and other limited liability  entities, it is best to establish the limited liability entity in such a way  that it has the greatest appearance of an operating company (for example, a  separate board of directors, separate management, separate employees,  separate operating agreements and leases, etc.).  As mentioned, however, it  is all a matter of degree and generally speaking it is difficult to establish  a case where the courts will allow the ""corporate veil"" protecting  shareholders to be ""pierced"".  4. With respect to capturing tax losses incurred in the limited liability  entity, if Enron Canada is the sole shareholder so that there is no change of  control on a winding-up into Enron Canada, Enron Canada can avail of tax  losses incurred in the Enron Canada entity through a winding-up.  Obviously,  however, this would mean that Enron Canada takes on the liabilities of the  special purpose entity as a result of the winding-up, including the  liabilities for any acquired PPA.  Otherwise, the general rule is that the  tax losses, if any, would be captured inside in the Enron Canada entity and  would not be available to be used against Enron Canada's taxable income.  5. With respect to Project Stanley, there is really no established case  authority directly on point, but the better view is that any sanction, if and  when imposed on Enron Canada, would be imposed in a way that would prevent  Enron Canada from indirectly avoiding the application of the sanction, such  as by moving certain business operations into a special purpose entity.  In  other words, if Canada or Alberta were intent on suspending or affecting  Enron Canada's abilities to transact through the PPAs or otherwise in the  Alberta Power Pool, it is likely that the sanction would be imposed upon  Enron Canada and its affiliated entities also transacting through the Power  Pool.  Based upon the preliminary answers, please let me know if you want a more  detailed legal opinion to consider these issues further and whether Hemstock  and I should be approaching the Government to qualify a special purpose  entity.

The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the  message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months  now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday  (Enron holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and  should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six  times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by  4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a  state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders  by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on  our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution  of this problem. Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower  and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.   I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing  business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the  agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense  or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to  another server. Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

I envision a one page  summary that provides you with a monthly and quarterly sub-region coverage  ratio. I propose that the quarterly coverage standard be set  at 100%. The monthly coverage standard would be at least 50%. These standards  would drive consistent, ongoing coverage of commercially  active customers. Less active or inactive customers would be contacted at  least once a quarter to determine status changes and propose  product structures. This reporting format would also place emphasis on each  commercial team's coverage effectiveness or lack thereof.  I will  derive this summary from a master customer list that will show contact dates  and specific comments on customer status. I anticipate this master  list to be 20-25 pages. I propose to provide you a copy of the master list  quarterly in order to corroborate the monthly summary. Do my proposed  coverage standards and reporting format meet your expectations?  In addition, I have asked my commercial teams to prepare regional business  plans by July 12. A primary component of these plans will be identification of major new business initiatives by sub-region. Tammy  Shepperd asked me to provide you with an initial report this week. I  don't want to provide you with something ""half-baked"".  Is it acceptable to  allow my commercial teams to complete their plans then provide you with our suggested initiatives by July 13 ?

The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately  combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real  time risk. TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the  traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by  the               traders to meet their needs.    -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in  consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to  come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.  4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.

"Tony  Wow I don't think so.   I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of  the factual errors.  If you disagree please write me back.  I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named  President of the Canadian operation.  We went from a small gas marketing shop  to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.  It was  absolutely awesome.  I had the time of my life.  We built the business with  very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's  bottom line.  These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading  and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create  liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.   So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help  build revolutionary new businesses.  What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk  management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.  The opportunities our  outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.  These  businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different  variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage  in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.  You can't  put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other  commodities.  Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to  figure out what the Fed is going to do.  It has much more complexity, and if  you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down  here! .... we need you!  John's callout quote  Enron's not a place where you can hide.  If you can't get it done you won't  fit in.  But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll  excell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you.

I  have been working with EOTT Energy Corporation for the last  four  months on a temporary basis on a project involving setting up a profit/loss  report  for  the  various regions within the United States for EOTT's  crude  oil trading and marketing business.  Previously, I worked in the  energy  industry  for  over  two  years  in  trading, risk management, structured  products  and  marketing of electricity and natural gas for the western  United  States.   Additionally,  I  was  actively  involved in the physical  markets  and  gained  a strong understanding of the western grid. Furthermore,  I am an expert in options trading and have a strong knowledge of the commodity and financial markets.  Moreover, I have also traded NYMEX natural  gas  futures,  options  on futures, forward contracts for physical power  and  options  in  SERC, SPP, MAAC, MAIN, ECAR and ERCOT.  Finally, I have  had  experience  setting  up/operating  market  simulation models and maintaining the underlying databases for fixed income securities.  Prior to entering the energy markets, I worked as the senior trader/risk manager for Mellon  Mortgage  Company  in  Houston,  Texas.   At  Mellon,  I positively affected  the  bottom  line  performance  of the company for over two years through  strategic  trading  and  hedging of mortgage backed securities.  I received the Premier Achievement Award from the Chief Executive Officer for outstanding  financial  performance  and  the  Employee  Choice  Award from co-workers for my tenacity and diligence in work.  My expertise with listed futures  and  options  on  futures,  OTC  options and swaps, as well as the ability  to  positively  affect  the  bottom  line could definitely make an impact  with  your  team.   In addition, my competitive and entrepreneurial personality  allows  me to constantly look for profitable solutions or cost effective ways of managing risk.  As  you  will  note  from  the  enclosed  resume, I managed the trading and hedging  of  the  interest  rate risk on mortgage loans for Mellon Mortgage Company.   The  interest  rate risk was managed by use of forward sales and purchases  of  mortgage backed securities, put and call options on mortgage backed securities, and 10 year CMT Index floors.  In addition,  futures and options on futures on U.S. Government Treasury notes and bonds were used at the  appropriate  time  taking into account the basis between mortgages and treasuries.   Previously,   I worked for The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in  New York as a proprietary trader in fixed income. Earlier, I worked for Garvin  Guybutler  Corporation,  a  major  international  money and deposit broker.    Primary  responsibilities  at  Garvin  included  uncovering  and executing  arbitrage EuroDeposit transactions in order to enhance placement yields   and   reduce   borrowing  costs  relative  to  Eurodollar  deposit transactions  of  similar  maturities.   In addition, I was involved in the brokering   of   Term  Federal  Funds,  EuroDollar  deposits,  EuroCurrency deposits, Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Rate Agreements.  It  would be my pleasure to discuss these qualifications with you and learn more  about  positions  in  natural  gas  trading with Enron North America. Please contact me so we can talk about possible opportunities.  Thank you,  Rick J.

The  commodity traders I dealt with at Tiger (Paul Touradji & Rob Ellis) are in  the process of setting up their own hedge fund and will trade with us again  in late Autumn once they get their paper work in order.  2000 Hedge Fund Origination Summary  Tiger   $112,000  (began trading in Dec 99 and stopped in Mar 00) Tudor   $384,700 (began trading in Mar 00) Ospraie  $589,940 (began trading in May 00)  Total year to date $1,086,640 (My budget est for 2000 is approx $2mm)  I've attached two files. The first is a spread sheet with all our hedge fund  trades year to date in detail. In there you will see a tab for work in  progress, these are the funds I am targeting to get signed on for trading  with us and the state of play with each.  The second is a word document  listing the hedge funds I have had contact with.  While the Hedge Fund  universe is large, 1500-2000 easily, the ones that trade commodities and more  specifically trade OTC rather than futures are limited. The entire universe  is probably no more than 30-50 names, many of which are too small to bother  with. For the most part I look for them to have $100mm under management since  the allocation to energy commodities is usually a small percent of that, e.g.  10-15%. A few of them, however, specialize in commodities and represent my  priority target clients.

I have been working for ENA as Senior Specialist.   I work in Andrea Reed's group, and report to her through L'Sheryl Hudson.  On  August 8th, on behalf of Andrea Reed, L'Sheryl Hudson told me that with the  dissolution of CTG, Andrea's group would change significantly and that there  would be  no growth opportunities for me in this group. I was told that I  should look for opportunities and growth elsewhere.   After talking to numerous people in Enron, I found someone who told me to go  to EBS. In EBS I approached Paul Trieschman of HR and Larry Lawyer. Paul  Trieschman said he would check in EBS and forward my resume to people who  might be looking to fill in vacant positions. Larry sent me to Ravi  Thuraisingham, who was looking for someone with telecom background. Ravi  talked to Jim Fallon, who was also looking for someone with telecom  background.   My background in Williams Communications Group, Inc., and specifically  working on Fibre build business plan and related subjects, like cost study of  fibre capacity, provided a direct fit with the position that Ravi and Jim  wanted to fill. Ravi, after asking what I had done at Williams  Communications, went to discuss my background with Jim Fallon. In the  afternoon he called and made me an offer to join EBS. I accepted the offer.  He told me that the projects that I will be doing are about Fibre build.  Upon receiving the offer, I went to Andrea Reed and told her about the offer  and the excellent fit that this position has with my telecom background.  I  told her that this position gives me great opportunity to make contribution  to Enron's broadband efforts. Andrea, knowing that there are no growth  opportunities for me in her group,  said she fully supports my transfer to  EBS. She has already called Paul Racicot and told him of her support for my  transfer to EBS (Please see Andrea's email below).    Jim Fallon and Paul Racicot, understandably, are very sensitive about my  transfer to EBS. They want to finally check it with you and get your support  for my transfer. Everything related to my transfer has been finalised, except  that Jim and Paul want to hear directly from you and get your approval.   Andrea Reed fully supports my transfer and has no concerns about it. I would  appreciate if you could O'K my transfer to EBS. I do not want to miss this  opportunity, and would like to start as soon as possible.

I envision a series of  transition teams, organized by function, that are responsible for  transferring systems, knowledge, and people from the east and west power  desks up to the Calgary office.  These are my initial thoughts.  Things will  obviously change as we learn more about the market rules and when we get the  head of the desk in place.  Trading Transition team - Tim Belden, Mike Swerzbin, Bill Greenizen Hire head trader.  John L. and Tim are currently working with John Zufferli  to guage interest and come to terms on relocation.  John Z. is planning a  trip to Portland and Calgary as soon as he is able to fly.  Hopefully the  week of September 16th. Get EOL products defined and posted.  Greenizen hopes to get this done by  September 16th. Develop curves.  Currently using implied PPA bid curves. Develop position reports. Give offers to origination team.  Tim/Mike/Bill will provide prices to  origination until head trader has been hired.  Risk Transition team - Monica Lande and Kathy ?? Kathy traveled to Portland on 9/5 and 9/6 to learn about our risk process and  book deals. Book positions.  In process of entering five deals.  One for each unit, line  losses for each unit, and payment for the PPA.  Will run mini book to ensure  that close to zero value is created when all deals are booked and run against  our curves.  Should have this done by September 8th. Drop curves. Create position reports.  Scheduling Transition team - Jeff Richter, Bill Greenizen, Peggy H. Learn and define scheduling requirements in Alberta. Learn about California scheduling systems. Assess applicability of California scheduling systems to Alberta market. Hire a scheduler.  Real Time Transition team - John Forney Assess whether we need to run real time group in Calgary.  We may be able to  start with someone on days and have nights and weekends covered from  Portland.  Legal issues with Portland providing service to Calgary. Assuming we want a real time person in Calgary ... hire a RT trader/analyst.   We may be able to draw from Portland's real time desk for this.  Fundamentals Transition team - Tim Heizenrader and Stephan ??, and Chris Wiebe We can use the Portland fundamentals team to do much of the work before  January.  We have the systems and most likely the staff to come up with the  first generation of Alberta fundamentals. Train a person who will eventually be located in Calgary on West Power  Fundamentals -- systems and processes.  Stephan or Chris W. may fit this  bill.  Must get buy in from Heizenrader and head trader. We have a person in Houston, Sanjeev Khanna, who used to work for Enmax and  now works for structuring in Houston.  He is not interested in relocating to  Calgary, but would like to help us learn about the market. Should consider trying to hire industry expertise from local utility.  Derek  will work on this.  Sanjeev may have some ideas here. Establish better network connections between Portland and Calgary.  Dan  Dietrich.  Volume Management Transition team - Murray O'Neil, Peggy H., Laura Scott Learn market rules for settlements.  Get 1 person from Derek's group to try  to spell out the settlements formulas on both the pool side and the contract  side. Compare Alberta Power Pool settlements procedures to California settlements  and determine whether Volume Management system will do the job. Come up with a manual backup plan until VM system will work. Hire someone to do volume management in Calgary.  We are currently assessing  whether anyone from Portland could do this job.   I will be out of the office until September 16th.  We have already made plans  for Bill G, Kathy, Peggy, and Laura to come to Portland to check out our  systems and processes.  Shortly after I return we should be able to nail down  the head trader position.  Tim Heizenrader will call Sanjeev to see if there  is a role for him to play in our Fundamental Analysis effort.  It may be  worth waiting until the head trader is in place to do this.  I'm off to Montana for a week.  Debra Davidson will be able to get in touch  with me.  She can be reached at 503-464-3820.

A  representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from  competitors and from the audience, who criticized the system as giving Enron  the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over  competitors.   Scott Coleman, an official at Altra Energy Technologies, said proprietary  systems like EnronOnline, and systems being developed by a consortium of  large market players, represent a danger to the health of the energy industry  because of their current or potential market power. Altrade operates its own  independent online exchange that is one of Enron's biggest electronic  competitors. It differs from EnonOnline in that various buyers and sellers  trade with each other with Altrade serving to clear the transactions. On  EnronOnline, Enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every  transaction.   The proprietary EnronOnline trading system has been accused of market  manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last  November and because of the market strength of its operator, Enron Corp.   Enron is the energy industry's largest marketer/trader/risk manager and one  of the largest natural gas pipeline operators. About 60% of its marketing and  trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system. Critics charged  that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of  the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available  only to Enron.   EnronOnline has handled more than 280,000 transactions worth $140 billion  since going live. The proprietary system handles about 2,000 transactions  every day with a value estimated at $1 billion, and most of its online  business is natural gas and power sales and purchases.   Why has the system been so successful? It's free, easy to use, low risk and  there is a tight bid-ask spread, both EnronOnline and its competitors note.  There's no special hardware required; everything is on the web and a  transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse. It also provides a  broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is  supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other  systems out there, few if any have the content, ease of use and price  discovery of EnronOnline.   Critics claimed that power enables EnronOnline to ""soak up liquidity"" in the  marketplace, and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its  competitors. With each trade, Enron gains a little bit more information about  its competitors' positions in the market.   ""Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself,"" said  Altra's Coleman. ""But in the short term, I think if any one player has enough  of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one  direction or another.""   EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply ""providing a  service for our customers, particularly a bid and ask. But I don't think  Enron has the ability to move markets. We are just putting a bid and ask out  there, and if people want to buy at our prices, then fine. If people want to  sell at our prices, fine then sell it. I don't think we have the market  manipulation capability people suspect... We are not bigger than the  marketplace.""   When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the  system, Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of  its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the ""Big Brother""  of the energy marketplace.   ""The historical information is not available,"" EnronOnline's Shults admitted.  ""We just started calculating the indices and price reports... We are now  providing that information to the market so everyone else has that  information as well."" He said Enron does not retain information about those  who use its system.   Shults did, however, warn that the system will make the U.S. energy market  much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future. With  increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide  commodities on EnronOnline, for example, market activity in Africa and the  Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets.   Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc., Shults also predicted  electronic exchange revenues could grow from $500 billion this year to more  than $3 trillion in 2004-2005.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --  ,Copyright 2000 Intelligence Press Inc.

Larry was adamant that there will be no delay in Alberta  and said there is no point in any stakeholder even proposing a delay because  it such a proposal was a ""non-starter"" and won't happen.  He told me during  the discussion that investors will not invest in a jurisdiction where the  government does not follow through with what it says it will do and he  referred to the Jan 1, 2001 date as a firm commitment of the government  entrenched in the legislation.  I agreed with him that this was absolutely  the right approach and told him that the Government had Enron's full support  on this issue.

It should also be noted that our July  settlement was not offset by our purchases due to an apparent oversight by  the Settlements group, resulting in an additional $678,000 of credit  exposure.  EES's credit exposure is still being researched but is estimated  to be over $5,900,000 of additional exposure.  We are working with EES to  resolve these issues as well.  As I mentioned today, Perry Gas Companies, Inc. was not approved for credit  on any of these transactions and was on our Credit Watch List.

However, with respect to creating a  redundant physical system operation/real-time unit monitoring/dispatch  function in Ontario, it simply does not make economic or logistical sense.   With the integration of the  6 peaker plants into our operation and the  associated IT support, control area operations, plant operations, hourly  trading, and real-time monitoring system here in Houston, we could provide  all the necessary tools and support personnel necessary to perform this  function from Houston.   All the critical trading information would obviously  be available to the Ontario office, yet they would not have to be burdened by  the additional overhead to build a stand alone physical operation.  From my standpoint, it just doesn't make sense to re-create the physical  capabilities the Houston office has developed over the past two years.  The  Ontario guys are doing a great job and I like their aggressive attitude,  however, rationale business decisions should still prevail.

Please  also contact Ed Baughman on the TIE proposal for dispatching, scheduling and  trading services that was recently done to leverage of the existing Genco  facilities and staff.  On the dedicated ring downs all work was co-ordinated by Darren Adamik  (713-853-4764) if you require additional details.  Generally it will take 4 staff for a 24 hour operation plus one vacation/sick  relief.  Depending on the complexity of the operation you will have to  determine the level of industry expertise.  A good plan would be to hire a  senior lead utility type and then bring on junior staff.  The quality and  quantity of staff will likely be based on the value at risk and the  complexity of dispatching these units.   If you consider the operation critical a diesel and UPS will be required.  Plasma displays run $10,000 to $15,000 per display plus any switching/av  equipment.  We have a PI consultant on contract that could be available for your PI  project - typically $ 150.00 per hour plus travel and expenses.

"Now that the accrual book is fresh on your mind, I would like to propose the  following for Schedule C prudency:  1)  Monetize $20 million of the 2001 accrual gas position to be utilized for  the following Schedule C prudency accounts:  $10 million against the JEA (Northern Florida) short position (170,000 MWh's  on-peak).   We have mid-marketers attempting to buy energy for 01 and 02 in  FL, however, the market is extremely tight with no competitive offers.   The  JEA position is covered with FPL non-firm power, therefore, we are exposed to  on-peak price volatility due to FPL economic curtailment during load  management periods. $3 million against the VEPCO market-based call option with a look back audit  on pricing.  This deal is an absolute pain in the ass because we are forced  to quote a price to VEPCO that is representative of an actual transaction at  reasonable prices with a rationale counterparty in the SE market.  They can  call on the MW daily, weekly, or monthly.   We can lose as much as $2-3  million/yr on this BS position due to the logistical issues and look back  audit rights that VEPCO has. $2 million against the MJMUC (inside Associated Electric Coop) 40 MW 7x24  short position in a transmission constrained market area with absolutely no  liquidity.  We have this position marked against the Entergy curves, however,  physical delivery is a major issue which creates curtailment (and LD$)  uncertainty. $5 million against the OPPD 110 MW daily shaped call (with hourly  flexibility) that is nearly impossible to hedge cleanly.   OPPD is in  Southern MAPP (Nebraska) and delivery risks are significant.  The total deal  is in our books at negative $25 million (10/2/00 curves) and we potentially  have an additional $5 million of exposure due to illiquid nature of MAPP,  scalar risk, and physical delivery risk.  We have several other customer deals that have hair, however, they are  generally more manageable from a physical delivery standpoint.   Each of the  deals above are in illiquid markets with delivery problems and scheduling  flexibility for the counterparty that is incosistent with the current power  trading market.   For these generic reasons and the specific issues outlined  above, I am recommending Schedule C prudency for the amounts indicated  above.   From my standpoint, it is prudent and appropriate to use $20 million from gas  accrual gains to finance these prudency positions.  Let me know your thoughts.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,  on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project.  I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been  good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now  we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

We've had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation.  Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this  project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan.  Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical,  transport, swaps, options, ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index, Physical gas for Nymex, Physical gas for Inside Ferc, Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms,  prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of  individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit  and explicit position break out issues.  -- Allan.  PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for  transport.

"John--Attached is an update of the values in the various transport books as  of October 3rd.  Please note that the East Desk has already made its  changes.  All that was done was to move the correlations up--the old  percentage and new percentage of each deal is shown on the sheet.  I am  waiting on a deal by deal breakdown of extrinsic value changes, but I have  been told that the change in total for the East Desk was ($5,900,000).  They  brought this in at the same time they cleared out the $5,700,000 positive  that had been withheld, resulting in about a ($200,000) change.  Please let  me know if you disagree with any of the changes that were made and we will  fix them.  They really did not seem very controversial since these were all  Columbia Gulf transports and the correlations were just set too low.  The West Desk's proposal on PGT/Kingsgate is also shown on the worksheet.   After speaking with the Canadian office on forward AECO basis, Phillip and  Keith believe the Kingsgate / Malin spread should be widened considerably.   At this time they are proposing moving the current spread from $.1676 to  $.2676, and moving the correlations up to the point that results in a  $.0303/MMBtu extrinsic value number.  They believe this would put the values  in the appropriate places, and would result in very little net impact overall  to their books.  As of yesterday's close, the impact would be a positive  $55,301 change.  No changes will be made until you approve it.   Regarding the Central Region, I have not spoken with or received anything  from Hunter and Andy yet.  Neither one of them is here today but I will get  with them as soon as I can to let you know the Central Region's proposal.   You can at least see where they stood as of October 3rd for what is on the  books.  I have not included Geoff Storey's capacity deals on this sheet since  his have no extrinsic value, but I will be happy to add them if you need that  info.",john.lavorato@enron.com,colleen.sullivan@enron.com,Transport Worksheet,2000-10-09 07:31:00-07:00,received

"John:  I spoke with Tim yesterday evening regarding your feedback to the  compensation proposal I sent last week. Before our conversation this morning  I wanted to give you a chance to review some of thoughts I have which might  help keep our discussion more focused.   First, I think we've both been at Enron about the same amount of time and  probably share similar experiences about contracts and compensation at Enron.  In general, my experience is that there has never been any open information  by management about any overall compensation structures, equity plans,  compatability between ENA groups or other Enron companies. Just as we all  have to create our own path at Enron we generally must do our own research  and draw our own conclusions about compensation within and outside Enron. In  several cases we have lost people we are trying to contract as a result of  the contracting process! In my opionion, this is mostly because of the lack  of communication of any ""overall compensation plan"" which drives people to  the market to make an evaluation which they otherwise may not be inclined to  do if information were available. Among the many ENA managers I have worked  with none has ever explained any such ""plan"". Tim has indicated that there is  some sort of overall compensation structure plan that you and Dave Delainey  are trying to adhere to. I would appreciate some discussion about this as it  may relieve some of the concerns we all end up having about signing a  contract without being 100% satisfied with the minimum amounts in the  contract (primarily because we've experienced the verbal commitment which is  forgotten or lost in the latest management shuffle).   Second, Tim indicated some concern about locking in certain minimum overall  compensation levels and that ""if a person were to have a bad year there may  be no room for bonus"". I think this is a real concern particularly when we  consider a new trader from outside the company. In my case, while I currently  don't have a specific book that gets marked each day, I think there is a  clear record over the past seven years of significant value to ENA's west  power business. This value comes in several forms: value above the  offer/below the bid, market information driving both short and long-term  value into our books, developing new markets and products for ENA, extending  my market knowledge and deal structuring capabilities on a continuous basis  each day to other origination/strucuturing/mid-market/real time groups,  building a no-risk/high value Services business, and providing leadership to  employees about their role at Enron or Enron's role in the market. All of  these efforts are focused on adding mark-to-market value to ENA in more ways  than any single, specific book can measure. I am certain that I will continue  to add value in these ways and have little concern about this ""bad year""  scenario.  Finally, I am trying to make sense of the proposed compensation that Tim has  relayed to me. If I understand it correctly my cash compensation pay would  change from $206k ($130 base /$56 COLA /$50 retention) over the past three  years as a Director to a base pay of $170k as a Vice President with higher  expections and increasing responsibilities. The equity plan that is currently  available to Vice Presidents and above would be locked in at values of  $175/$125. This one is a little hard for me to evaluate as it is new in its  current form (I have been a participant in prior years of similar equity  plans which have ranged in initial from $10k-$50k as a Director). Bonus would  be determined annually, I assume under similar process as past years. The  trouble I am having is evaluating a significant decrease in cash compensation  after being promoted and locking in a known (versus unknown) value in an  equity plan for which I presumably am already a participant in and for which  there is little other plan information available to evaluate.  I would  appreciate your thoughts on this in relation to any overall compensation  ""plan"".  I'll look forward to our discussion.

This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to  support them.  a.  The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk).  b.  Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more  cabling for the turrets.   There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling  c.  AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer  manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.   The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in  late December.   Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 2001.  2.  This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems.  a.  Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.  3.  The Response Time would be affected.  a.  The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA  trading floors.   A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels,  Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.   Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs  for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group.  b.  We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on  Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.   The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.  4.  There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be  susceptible to power outages.   I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to  move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.  Level 29 has been  completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is  also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.  This floor has been built out with  Trading Desk furniture as well.  My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14;  this will save the company both money and time.  Your help is needed to  convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.  Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.

I wanted to communicate the  results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem  appropriate for our activities.  The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial  depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The  advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult  to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different  states of development and application of business strategies.  The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is  obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of  evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that  the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK  market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these  similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent  of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business  experience and corresponding strategy.  I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and  foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our  business.

"Earlier this year, Dana had several mis-booking issues with the UI  transaction, which resulted in negative trading hits in Q3 (already  incorporated in P&L).   The significant items were:   RESCO PPA (outages not booked properly) - $8 million  Congestion & Ancillary Assumptions  - $8-10 million  Millstone nuclear option ($32/Mwh option) - $5-6 million  (With sale of  Millstone, this option goes away)  The $32/Mwh Seabrook nuclear plant daily option was not modeled for 01-03  because the sale of Seabrook (expected to occur earlier this year) is an  automatic termination of the $32/Mwh option, therefore the value was not  booked.  Since the sale of Seabrook sale has not occured yet and a minimum of  10 months is required to get state & local, NRC and FERC approvals for the  sale of Seabrook, we have a positive value surprise to the tune of $10-12  million (assuming option is booked through 9/01.

"SEABROOK P&L Booking the 200 MW Seabrook position through for calender 2001 results in a  positive $23.5 million.  For background purposes, UI has a 17.5% ownership interest in the Seabrook  nuclear facility (total facility is 1142 MW).   The other owners of Seabrook  are as follows:   Northeast Utilities 40% (they are driving the sale - it is a condition on  their Con-Ed merger)   Great Bay Power  12% (they have announced their intention on selling)   New England Power 10%   Other minority owners 20% (8 small minority municipal & IOU owners)  The Seabrook facility has been on the auction block for the past 6-9 months,  and given the uncertainty of the timing of the sale, Dana & I felt it was  imprudent to book calender year 2001 until we knew with certainty that the  plant asset transfer (and associated state, NRC and FERC approvals) would  occur after 2002.  Remember contractually, EPMI's 200 MW PPA position  terminates upon final closure of a UI sale of its 17% interest.   With  respect to Millstone, Pilgrim and Maine Yankee nuclear asset sales, the  majority owner drives the sale process and minority owners generally almost  always sell their interest at the same price as the majority owner.   With  respect to UI's 17.5%  interest in Seabrook, UI has already informed us they  intend on selling their interest along with the majority owner.  Obviously, the plant has not yet been sold and I feel comfortable (given a  10-12 month approval process coupled with Seabrook's politically sensitive  location in New Hampshire) booking the 200 MW position through 2001.  ICAP P&L Given the huge regulatory uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of ICAP  in NE,  Dana is uncomfortable taking any of the $55 million to income at this  time.   Basically, our opinion is that the regulatory decision will either  result in a default price of $0.50-1.00/kW/Mo (resulting in approx $20-30  million postive P&L) or a default price of $3-3.50/kW/Mo (loss of $20-30  million).  The ICAP decision has once again been removed from the FERC agenda for next  Wednesday's meeting.   This is the 3rd time that has happened in the past 2  months and indicates a lack of consensus at FERC.   Given this FERC  indecisiveness and the current situation in California and reliability issues  in both the Western and Eastern US in general,  I am very concerned that FERC  does not have the political guts to pull the plug on ICAP (or lower the  default price to low penalty rate).  Given this regulatory situation, there is a 50/50 chance we lose additional  money and a 50/50 chance we make additional money.   Said another way, we  would likely use the entire $55 million in ICAP $'s to completely hedge ICAP  through the term of UI.  In addiiton, there was a FERC ruling regarding PJM ICAP today that said  $4.00+/kW/Mo for PJM ICAP was indeed market based and not market  manipulated.  This coupled with FERC's lack of decision for 3+ months on NE  ICAP makes us very uncomfortable.   The good news is we are not short PJM  ICAP.

I think that  I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me  know.  Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of  Enron.  Regards, Tim  New Cap Specifics On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a  new price cap methodology. The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as  can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to  achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date  might be. The new price cap methodology will remain in place until: Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven  to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions. Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal. Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the  following heat rate table:   Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap   <25 GW   10,775   $43.10   25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70   30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90   35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90   >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment. Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps. The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior  to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead  system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior  to the hour of delivery.  FERC Context FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000. The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid  cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of  electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices. The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.   FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days  after their authority expires) FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its  206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know  what they will find or what they will propose. The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will  likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on  11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral  comments. Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price  caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations. It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into  effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC  extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from  the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.  Impact of Price Caps The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at  different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets  would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to  say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap  because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the  cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below. Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.    Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new  price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices. Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets. Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.   For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January  through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January  through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400  from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual  observations. We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the  calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices  for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each  hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour  could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly  average cap value! The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000  NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power  prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.       ",gary.hickerson@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,Price Caps,2000-10-30 04:28:00-08:00,sent

She has suggested the  we use Cap Gemini to help convert Daniel's systems for the Canadian  business.  I have also given Beth a name of a systems guy that came  recommended that would be an employee here to help translate the differences  in the markets and would ultimately be the Dan Maitland of Canada to look  after the product as we build the business.  I think that it would be very helpful to have Daniel involved in the scoping  due to his familiarity with the systems and the settlement requirements with  the wires and pipes companies.  If Daniel could direct the development out of  London, that would be great as well.  I heard that he did a great job on the  Spanish effort.  Dave Delainey and John Lavorato are supportive of building this business here  and the Canadian president(Rob Milnthorp) is also keen to grow this  business.  I think that we can be much more effective using the UK systems  than trying to build our own from scratch.  I would rather build this without  looking to the EES IT resources out of Houston, as I believe that we will be  more successful importing the latest ED systems and modifying them for this  market in time for market opening--just 2 months away.  I really appreciate your help on this, and hope that we can work together to  deliver another success to Enron as a whole.  I'm sure glad that I know you  guys as I know that I will end up with a product that works for us.  Don't  worry, I will not try any coding myself.  Best regards to you both, and I hope you are staying DRY in wet old London  Mark.

Listed below are  the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:    As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts)  and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is  essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct  a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The  pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and  available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a  secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts  feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or  Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.   The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the  completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system  is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your  Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated  correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are  unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or  Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.  Supervisors You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the  Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate  this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at  your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not  conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the  rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.   Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at  x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to  provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have  been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final  cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are  responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be  representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind  that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will  ensure that the final PRC is a success.  Associates/Analysts You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received  your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this,  please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system  and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many  people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your  reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of  reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will  also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the  opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you  have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may  hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do  not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.    An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000  at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and  Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be  communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be  communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the  Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should  contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly  Butler x3-4584).

"Thinking about bull move, the only trade I really like is being long physical  and short NYMEX.  If you believe that NYMEX is doing a ""buzz lightyear""  (infinity and beyond), the next question is where does that put the cash.   Back in '95, Chicago cash went to $40 and merc died out sub 5 dollars.  Also,  '95 had a huge geographic basis rift, the structural shift had Z3 trading  about $1.50 over Waha.  On the upside, cash will suffer constraints, causing  demand spikes. On the downside, cash shouldn't materially outpace NYMEX.  Reviewing geographic arbs and considering the east coast political  environment (high potential for congressional intervention) as well as ok-ish  storage, the East may be the best basis sell vs. a long west trade (Waha I'm  uncertain about, particularly if the cold doesn't hit Texas...Chicago might  be better given what's going on there except for the Alliance issue...Socal  appears to be the best geographic long...PGE citygate could really rock given  storage and increase supply competition given Alliance PL...    The  Z6/Chicago spread is trading around $1.56 for the winter  (FH) and  approx. a  dime in today's intra-month.   The Z6 vs. NGI-PGE/CG spread has the Jan-Mar  around .94 cents, Z6 over. Intra-month it is trading at $2.43, PGE/CG over  Z6   (I'm waiting on additional stats, but I think I like this trade...)  Additionally, playing the '95 scenario, we should be long every basis  downstream of Henry and short something else, maybe NYMEX, Waha, Katy   (notice smaller font)   I'm still reviewing economic stats regarding the  drivers to these trades such as, Sable Island, LNG, Chippewa (Canadian  imports) and Chicago/California storage .

"** Related to critical commercial issues. **  The ESA internet home page launch is ca. 4 weeks old and has met with  reasonable success.    The hits to the site continue to grow to several thousand per week; however,  the issues outlined below referring to our need to establish appropriate  commercial support to the site and proactively readying upgrades and next  generations integrated to the commercial efforts have fallen short.  ---------------------- Forwarded by D'Arcy Carroll/SA/Enron on 11/15/2000  12:09 PM ---------------------------   D'Arcy Carroll 11/07/2000 05:23 PM To: Joe Kishkill/SA/Enron@Enron cc: James M Bannantine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Diomedes  Christodoulou/SA/Enron@Enron   Subject: internet site - Enron South America  I wanted to forward some comments on the situation of the Enron South America  internet site and :  Emphasize the need to accelerate and integrate the understanding of the  leverage of the e-platform to the commercial business, including the need to  change the present priorities and responsibility of the commercial groups in  the region towards aggressively supporting and promoting the internet tool  and  Offer some comment on lessons learned implementing version 1 and  recommendations for more effectively executing a version 2 Comments: 1.    The support functions ( e-mail generated and internal allocation for  prompt responses to customer inquiry, text and content upgrades and editing,  etc.,..)  is  THE critical issue to realising the functional goal (efficient  customer capture ) of the site.     To my knowledge, the issue outlined in  the e-mail below (the  most recent of several urging action and some  decision-making) remains unaddressed, this almost 1 month following the  launch of the site.    From my  perspective and commercial experience, the  present situation which has inquiries being directed directly into a generic  e-mail system with part-time  support from the orginal PR staff is not  acceptable, nor advisable - as was extensively discussed in the weeks prior  to launch.      Though I understand that the commercial structure and strategy is in flux,  the clear indecision and lack of ownership reflects a lack of vision and    understanding of the power of the e-business tool, particularly in the  Brazilian market.   I forward the information to you because it's my view  that the   situation directly threatens Enron's credibility in the market at  a time when some of Enron's competitors (AES and Duke) are not only  established, but have,  at the same time as Enron's launch at Oil & Gas,   launched 2nd generation sites.   2.      Version 2  Brazil and South America. I am convinced that the poor civil infrastructure  and the physical distances restricting easy access to customers present  enormous opportunities for e-business platform business (Energy, Financial  Product and other commodities).   The best example of world class product-  and service-driven sites to date our, in my view, the on-line banking sites  (Itau, Bradesco).   They set a good, healthy benchmark.  IT.   In the development of the site, we need to consider technology  constraints in the bandwidth capacity and computer screen graphics of  targeted consumers in Brazil and elsewhere in the region.  The constraings  limit the degree of dynamism (Flash technology, Sound, 3-d  graphics/photography, etc.,..) that characterize world-leading sites familiar  in the US i.e., for now, there is a tradeoff between degree of ""sexy-ness ""  of the site vs. prohibitive time to load and navigate.  e-Biz Expertise. Enron UK has an in-house internet consulting group that  continues to develop but that provides comprehensive support and development  services to the product lines ( Houston tends to outsource or contract much  of the project work ); examples of the work they have produced are available,  impressive and much closer to cutting edge.   The Enron UK group should own  the devleopment of version 2 - pls note that there is already a significant  number of projects in their pipeline. e-Biz Support/Operations.The operation of the site including specifically the  IT component which addresses customer response and participation (tracking  hits voluem, storing profile questionnaire, e-mail response, etc.,..) is  probably the critical determinant for the functional success of the site.   Cutting edge technologies and their timely implementation to site or versions  launch needs to be absolutely mandatory with high deliverables. Competition. AES, Duke Energy have both launched 2nd versions of their  regional internet sites in the 6 months between initial launch and today;  both have upgraded pretty completely in terms of offering and functionality. Commercial.  The site is designed to streamline and deliver efficiencies and  value directly to the Commercial ( Trading and Origination ) exercises -  these groups need to be formally accountable to sign on and contribute to a  strategy, to initial and sequential content and graphics, language  translations, etc.,.. Either the Commercial groups drives the e-biz  initiative, or the e-biz initiative will fail. Ownerhsip. The breadth and integral importance of both commercial, regulatory  and IT issues complicate the ability to develop and execute the site  effectively.  It is a Development business and, as such, needs a clear  Project Manager (s) with the necessary authority establshed over the  contributing groups.     Pls forward any, all inputs and thank you for efforts extended to help  address the issues.  Note: Please be aware that I understand that to a large  extent all of the above is outside of my responsibility, but feel I need to  bring responsible closure to my contributions to and participation in the  launch of version 1.  ---------------------- Forwarded by D'Arcy Carroll/SA/Enron on 11/07/2000  11:30 AM ---------------------------   D'Arcy Carroll 10/25/2000 06:15 PM To: Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Joao  Guimaraes/SA/Enron@Enron cc: Orlando Gonzalez/SA/Enron@Enron, Keith Miceli/Corp/Enron@Enron, Miguel  Padron/SA/Enron@Enron, Steve Nagy/SA/Enron@Enron, Brett R  Wiggs/SA/Enron@Enron, Don Black/SA/Enron@Enron, Joe Kishkill/SA/Enron@Enron   Subject: candidate - Monica Matias, PR support for Enron SA - site   Keith, though Commerical has the largest stake in the success or failure of  the regional e-business product, i understood that  PR has the budget  allocation and, as agreed regarding the operational support of the site, the  policing/3rd party role to play i.e., ownership over this particular issue.    Gentlemen, this site is launched as of last week's Oil&Gas Conference ... or  certainly maintains an imminent, broader launch.  For starters, we need to  execute the agenda item outlined below and in previous e-mails which  allocates operational responsibility for commercial follow-up for the  site.      Today the contact resource for Brazil is a voice mail which is temporary  anyway and wasn't working until I called this morning asking about a message  I'd left on it last week; in addition, we haven't trained the present  operational support to understand how and to which groups to direct customer  inquiries.   e-bis. the e-business platform needs to get elevated to the next level -  follow-up for customer capture, responsible and timely response to inquiries,  etc.,.., not to mention more formal and public marketing of the site.     phase 2. the natural consequence of having a product and first phase site, is  that there will be plenty of internal comments and reactive idea generation  for a second phase site; this is fine and natural, but also will likely fall  into the responsibilities of the same position - initially at least, in terms  of information gathering and distribution.   if really necessary, why don't the relevant parties copied on this wire have  a 30 minute conference call to make this and other related decisions, so that  we move forward.  pls consider prioritizing this so that we execute in the  next few days.    ---------------------- Forwarded by D'Arcy Carroll/SA/Enron on 10/25/2000  05:39 PM ---------------------------   D'Arcy Carroll 10/18/2000 12:24 PM To: Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:    Subject: candidate - Monica Matias, PR support for Enron SA - site  Jose, here is the orginal communication.     The design of the site is to make progress toward alleviating the enormous  bottleneck and inefficiencies in the marketing effort to contact ( the  hundreds of small) national power generators, not to mention streamline the  customer capture costs for the broader EES product line.    If we don't  expect a need for a ( and eventually several ) full-time commercial support  for the site, then the launch will be a dismal failure.       But with the site ""launching""  this week and following a lot of work  yesterday and this morning cleaning up the kinks in the Monday version, we  need to be ready get her in position immediately.      What's more, she's  does almost all of the work carrying the load for the 3 assistants on the 4th  floor - that work needs (anyway) to get delegated to the other 2 assistants  ie., they either pick up the slack with competence, or be moved elsewhere.

"John,  We finished the Version 2 of the simulation model which deals with the open-close trading versus the continuous trading in the previous version.  I added the cummulative P/L as an output.   There are a few apparent trading strategies from this model:  1) Higher bid/offer spread, more profit 2) More Daily # of trades, more profit 3) Smaller net open positions allowed, more profit  1) and 2) are obvious, but 3) is more interesting.  It means that we are  better off if we do not allowed net open positions at end of the day.  In a trending  market, this makes an intuitive sense, for example, in the case of bull market we are  short as a market maker and we can avoid the loss at the higher openning price by keeping zero or small net short positions.  I have attached the model with this mail, and I'll  be happy to discuss the  model in more details with you.

"John,  I put together a presentation of the simulation model for WTI market maker  for you.  The P/L results are investigated by assuming different scenarios.  The key variable is the number of trade per day, therefore is varied  from  200 to 1000 trades.  Scenarios are generated by different spreads, net open position allowed, and  time period.  Take a look what I have prepared, and let me know things you want to add or  delete. If you have any questions, I will be happy to discuss with you.    Zimin  PS: this presentation is only for the open-close trading.  I will produce  exact the same sequence for the continuous trading (close-close) once you approve the  content.

The changes made were in correcting the handing of contract rolls  and correcting some of the roll dates.  The model still gives a higher profit, sometimes, for the cases of 1,000,000  bbl position limit vs.  5,000,000 bbl limit.   I took a look in detail at the  5 MM bbl case which gave lower profit (3 yrs out of Nov 95).   The intuition  is that there are two offsetting things which happen when you raise the  position limit.  1) you have a larger position to profit from when the market reverses a  trend, but 2) you loose much more money in a long term trending market, and to the  extent that you still hit your position limit, you will not make it all back  when the market reverses.  In the specific above case, you hit the position limits for both 1 MM bbl and  5 MM bbl, and the superior strategy is a trade off between limiting losses  vs. having a larger position from which to gain on major market reversals.  --Stinson  Open to Close   Continuous trading  ",kimberly.hillis@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,Updated WTI Trading Simulation,2000-12-19 22:43:00-08:00,sent

I don't have every detail yet, but I wanted to fill you in  because this is moving quite quickly.  TDC Energy is a small privately owned producer that had several deals with  CES that ENA acquired in last year's transaction.  Four of those transactions  were costless collars that are deep in the money for us.  TDC is disputing  the existence of these collars because CES never sent confirmations for  them.

In addition EPMI will pay New Albany  $1000 per start (for maintenance reserve fund) and $1.00/Mwh for variable  operating costs.  The New Albany, LLC will receive an 8% return on capital.   Book value will  be depreciated from $409/kW basis on 1/1/2001 to $336/kW on 12/31/2005.

The critical decision is to leave EES direct-access  customers on that tariff. Alternatively, if the PUC rules to end the rate  freeze, eliminates the existing CTC credits and does not allow EES customers  to switch to this tariff, we stand to lose somewhere between $600-650  million, as EES would have to serve their customer loads by buying expensive  CA power during 2001.  A 10% increase in tariff rates results in ~$50 million loss for EES. However,  if the tariff is extended beyond 2001, it will create additional value for  EES (the tariff is lower than Cal-02 power prices).   CA Gov. Davis met with Clinton yesterday where they have decided to extend  the emergency status in the state.  Ken Lay is scheduled to meet with Davis today to address the following topics:  - clarify any inaccurate information about Enron's role in CA markets  - urge the Governor to not go overboard with this situation and give the  ""world"" to the CA utilities  - remind about the upside PG&E and SCE will realize from high valuations of  hydro plants (increased almost three-fold from a year ago)  Hearings and oral arguments will continue this week. CA PUC decision is  expected to come on Jan-4th, followed by multiple appeals.  Credit issues:   - Enron is attempting to reduce credit exposure with PG&E, whereby PG&E will  assign its out-of-the-money trades with Avista and MS to EPMI and    EES will  assign its in-the-money positions with PG&E to EPMI, creating an off-set.  These assignments will reduce PG&E exposure by ~$265 MM,    in exchange for  Avista and MS exposures.  - PUC is not likely to rule removal of retail tariff retroactively (to May  99) - this will enforce EES position in collecting its accounts receivable  from    PG&E of ~$150 MM (so far, they have not paid Enron on the premise of  retroactive ruling).  Market Risk:  12/27 VaR is $7.8 MM - limit violation. An increase of $0.5 MM because of:  - addition of long Feb-01 positions at MidC  - overall increase in prices  - incorrectly booked trades at PJM (50 MWs Cal-03 Long instead of a Short)  My suggestion, at a high level, to Don Black and Dennis Benevides to sell MWs  in both East and West in order to reduce VaR.

"John  The questions that Gas Daily is receiving most likely pertain to the issue  that Nicor was closed on Friday but the weekend index published substantially  different from the Thursday index.  We did not transact at Nicor City Gate on  Friday and did not submit a change in trades to Gas Daily.  I will discuss  this with you tomorrow.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Hunter S Shively/HOU/ECT on 01/09/2001  06:26 PM ---------------------------   Patrice L Mims 01/09/2001 05:10 PM To: Hunter S Shively/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Patrice L Mims/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Chicago Midpoint pricing for December 21, 22, and 23, 2000     On December 21, 2000,  I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for gas  flow on  December 22-26, 2000.  The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of  $15.76.   This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted  via the telephone.   The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:  Nicor Gas Company was closed for  their company holiday on Friday, December  22nd.  As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for  the December  22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December  22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December  22nd (even though they were closed)  for the December 23-26 time period,  which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.  I  received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing  concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal  activity that transacted on December 22nd.    My practice is to take the price as reported on Enron Online.  On occasions  there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will  impact the Enron Online price.  Due to timeliness of sending the price  report, my volume is overstated, as opposed to intentionally reporting  erroneous information.

"1. Legislation Passes- Short-Term Measures, Very Long-Term Measures  As we said yesterday, SB-7X passed the California State Senate easily.  The  bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the  Department of Water and Resources until February 2nd.  The Department will  have $400 million available to finance power purchases, but there  expectations that these costs could easily rise to $1 billion by next week.  AB-1X has evolved into a longer-term solution and in its current form, would  authorize the Department of Water and Resources to enter into long-term  contracts (as opposed to the 15 day contracts in SB-7X) to buy power at a  price cap of 5.5 cents per kw/h.  This legislation is not expected to pass  today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week  period covered by SB-7X, when negotiations between generators, the utilities,  and the state are likely to resume.  A second piece of legislation under --SB 6X--has created uncertainty in the  markets.  This legislation will create a California Public Power Authority  with bond issuance authority.  The uncertainty concerns whether the new  authority will address the problem of the $12 billion in outstanding debt  owed by the utilities.  The current text of the legislation focuses only on  longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving  efficiency. Yet the legislation also says ""the authority may issue bonds,  exercise power of eminent domain, and enter into joint power agreements and  buy, own, and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a  project.""  The general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of  either issuing bonds to finance past debts, or using eminent domain or the  bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a Ch.11 proceeding.   2. Default Update  3. Bush  As we reported on Wednesday, the Bush Administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved",john.lavorato@enron.com,kristin.walsh@enron.com,California Power 1/19/00,2001-01-19 00:16:00-08:00,received

"The ERCOT team has met with Joe Des Champs for the Mid Marketing position in  our region.  It is my understanding that you must interview Joe before we can  make him a job offer.  I would like to proceed with the interview process.   Joe worked for me at Williams as the lead trader in the West.  Here are my  thoughts on Joe and why he is a good fit for our group.  1.  He has a very good understanding of the trading business, especially  natural gas in Texas and the western US. 2.  His personality is a great fit for Texas (especially with the loss of Jim  Ducote).  Joe has a lot of successful relationships within Texas and relates  well to Texans.  His initial appearance and manners appear to be easy going  and laid back, however he is a very agressive and effective trader.  His  command of the physical gas business is outstanding. 3.  Learns fast and relates well to traders.  I believe Doug and Joe will  work well together. 4.  Likes to work the phones.  What he is not: 1.  He is new to the power business.  However, he served the Williams/AES  plants in California.  So he is familiar with the power.  I would be glad to discuss Joe in detail or set up the phone interview.  I  have attached Joe's resume.

"Executive Summary Discussions continue today over bill AB1X, focus will be on price and term. New legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the  utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities' hydro assets in  exchange for rate increases. Wednesday, state receives bids from auction, rate ranges are expected to be  between 5.5 and 8.0 cents per kilowatt hour. Mid week, audit  findings will be released; audit expected to show PG&E's  utility subsidiary handed over $5B to the holding company. The holding  company used $4.4B to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock. State commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible  bankruptcy scenario.  Bankruptcy still very possible for both        companies. Davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue  solutions or ""bail out"".  Legislation There will be continued discussion regarding bill AB1X in the Senate today.   The discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour as  well as the term.  Assemblyman Keeley, the author, indicated that he believed  5.5 cents was ""a fantasy"" and impossible to obtain.   Today, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred  Keeley, D-Boulder Creek will introduce legislation whereby the state would temporary or permanently take both PG&E and Edision's hydroelectric  facilities or transmission lines (or both) in exchange for keeping the  utilities out of  bankruptcy.  The state would allow PG&E and Edison to impose rate increases,  however, the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this  month by the CPUC as an emergency surcharge.  The money collected from  consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state  would then enter into long-term contracts with power generators.  Under the  bill, the state of California would control 10% of all California's  electricity.  As you  can imagine, this legislation has not received unanimous praise.  According  to recent corporate filings, PG&E's hydroelectric plants alone would be  valued  between $3 and $5 billion.  This amount just happens to be what Davis  estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee  once  the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is  escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $12 billion in debt.   Davis  is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help  with about $4 billion in debt, while the utilities, of course, say the full  $12 billion should  be covered.   On Wednesday, state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy  suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their  effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come.  Davis  insists there are already several bids for his 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour  ceiling, though few  agree with his opinion.  A handful of smaller, independent electricity  providers with about a 30% share of California power market, indicated Sunday  night they would come down to ""less than eight cents"" or less than half of  what they currently charge, in return for the stability of long term  contracts.  Because  consumers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current  PUC rules, any hope California has to ""work off"" the back debts for these  utilities lies  in hitting something very close to Davis' price cap, without falling back on  higher prices for consumers.  The level of bids will be particularly  important since bond rating agencies moved to put the state of California on a Credit watch on  Friday, worried that there was no obvious long-term repayment plan for the  billions of  dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state.  Utility's Audit By the middle of this week, California auditors will release their findings  about how much money PG&E and SoCal Edison actually owe to institutions  outside their own holding company structure. This will define the limits of  what the state will guarantee, if they guarantee any of the debt. The truly  explosive  part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of  dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years.  A   source with knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last  three years, PG&E's utility subsidiary handed over about $5 billion to the  holding  company. Of that total, the holding company used $4.4 billion to pay  shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock.   Another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current  power crisis when regulators, at the time of deregulation (under the  direction of  Former R-Gov. Pete Wilson), forced the two utilities to sell at least half of  their power-generating plants.  Auditors are expected to say that if the  utilities  still owned all these plants, electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt  hour, compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in December and January.  Bankruptcy The threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities.  Senior  advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility  companies that  ended in bankruptcy.  As all the parties involved hunker down for another  intensely political week, they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy, but  to push  this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an  advantage.  Under such conditions, the risks of one or more of the players  fumbling and triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy, is still quite high.    California's political leaders order a series of independent analyses to  determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy, the state or the two  utilities. The short answer was that no one has any idea.  Below are the findings of the  report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge:  1) Would the companies be eligible for Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy?  Some of the advisors thought that PG&E and Edison's finances were so  bad that Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option.   Advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate  debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the  companies into full liquidation.   This would most certainly be guaranteed  chaos. 2) Could the bankruptcy court actually force the PUC to raise the price of  electricity to consumers? The legal basis for passing on rate increases to  consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought, particularly if there  is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies.   And  there is still the  question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge. 3) If the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets  seriously and finds that PG&E and Edison cannot afford to buy electricity,  he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages. 4) If the utilities go into bankruptcy, the first creditors in line would be  the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges.  The state could become  almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier   (one of the reasons why suppliers won't sell electricity on credit to these  companies now). 5) If the two companies went bankrupt, it would be the largest bankruptcies  in history, straining just about everyone involved in the process. 6) The corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets  from the utility by the FERC for PG&E and already in place for Edison  may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies  currently think. This is particularly true if this week's audit shows the two  corporations transferring  billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder  dividend payments.  Davis Opinion polls show that Governor Gray Davis is getting high marks for his  job, and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits.  One of Davis  concern's is, according to a senior official in the Governor's office, that a  deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so  anti-utility and  anti-business that it cripples future growth in the state.  According to a  senior official, ""No one thought Howard Jarvis and his property tax  initiative would  succeed in destroying our education system, but he did, with one just ballot  line and a lot of popular revulsion. The threat of direct, popular action is at least as large now as then.""  Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield is  already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that  individual  electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay  their debt through higher rate-payer bills.  This official goes on to say,  ""The  anger at utility companies is so high here, that almost anything Rosenfield  could think of would pass and we couldn't do anything about it.""  This threat  has  begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always  appeared wide open to political leaders -- floating a bond issue or a  guarantee  for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure,  and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next  several years.

"John, below are several issues I wanted to bring to your attention prior to  finalizing merit increases for East Power.  I have also given David Oxley the  same information in order for you to discuss this morning when you meet.   Call me if you have any questions.   M. Dana Davis's employment agreement will expire in February 28, 2001.  I  imagine we will want to renew with the new salary on the employment  agreement.  K Presto would like to recommendation that we give him a $20,000  increase.   Rogers Herndon' s employment agreement  will expire September 14, 2001.  Do  we want to renew earlier and roll the base salary changes (if any) into the  employment agreement. Kevin Presto would like to give him a $15,000 increase.   Who will be responsible for John Zufferli's increase (if any ) since he  transferred to Canada and now has been promoted to VP.    Rob Benson was given a significant increase in the global comp system at the  insistence of K.Presto.  Kevin states that John Lavorato indicated to him  that Benson needed to be taken care of.  With that being said Kevin would  like to bring him up more in line with a commerical director, which he was  just promoted to.  His employment agreement will expire 2/1/01.  So would it  also make sense to delete him from the merit database and renew an employment  agreement rolling in his new salary?    Finally, I need you to decide on Chris Dorland's new salary.  He is currently  making $81,000 and I have recommended $90,000.  He is an Associate that is  being made a commerical manager.  He was ranked superior and Presto has  indicated that he is expecting around $100,000.  Presto finally settled on  $95,000 provided you concur.  Our plan prior was slightly stagger salaries  for individuals as associates promoted to commercial manager based on final  rankings.  ($85,000 strong, $87,500 for excellent, $90,000 for superior). The  guideline from the program is $86,000 but is left up to the business unit  discretion.

"Please do not hesitate to contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh  (x39510) with additional questions.  Executive Summary An announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long-term contracts (price and term). The threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as Davis hatches a plan  to 1) pass on ""court ordered rate increases"" and 2) issue revenue bonds. Audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies.  Davis is expected to use the threat of ""endless  appeals"" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in November to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt, as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes. Davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to California  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy. Davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups.  If there is a  ballot initiative in November to challenge the expected court-ordered rate  hikes, it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state.  Legislation and Bail Out Bill AB1X was heard for several hours in the Senate Appropriations  yesterday.  Issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates.  However, the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups.   The bill  is expected to pass sometime today.  Tim Gage, CA Director of Finance said  Davis supports all the provisions in AB1X and expected to sign.    Bill AB18X was not heard in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today.  In committee hearings Monday, the DWR testified it is spent all of  the $400M and were spending $45M/day in the spot market to buy power.  According to sources with direct access to Governor Davis, the on-going court  battle, as discussed below, is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement.  Davis recognizes that 1) the expected court ruling in the CPUC  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  California rate payers; 2) despite that ruling, the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms.  Thus, Davis believes that  California consumers cannot avoid getting  hit with higher electricity  charges, but he plans to use the threat of an appeal (and a possible ballot  initiative) to limit the amount of the rate hikes.    A plan to exempt the lowest income, smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130% of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in Sacramento.  That would  still hit about one half of all consumers (since the ""baseline"" is set at 60%  of average consumption), but it is ""progressive"" in a politically important  sense.   Making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when PG&E admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates.    The company's defense (they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by Californians to use less electricity.   ""Every time you think  there's a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves,  something like this happens,"" one legislator moaned.  Long-Term Contracts  A second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long-term power buying  contracts Davis initiated earlier this month.  The first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive, according to officials in the talks.  ""We got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals.   And some not so good ones,"" one  official told our source.   ""The idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say,  'you want in on this with these terms?'   We think we'll eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy.""  Bankruptcy  Because of these new dynamics, there is improved market confidence that  California will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  SoCal Edison and PG&E, even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today (remember, there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until Feb. 13).  We believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of US District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los  Angeles, which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week, at  the latest.  In fact, without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis.   Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives Markets, Bush administration officials, and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control.  The threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  California Public Utilities Commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid-January.  First, the audit of SoCal Edison confirmed that $2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power.  Second, it confirmed that Edison electric paid nearly $5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt-issuing binge.   The audit of PG&E released late last night was even more damaging: PG&E  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  ""clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis"" by not making deep  spending cuts, ""including scaling back management salaries.""  The auditors  also questioned the utility's decision to funnel some $4.7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks.   ""Basically, they took the money and ran,"" as State Senate Speaker Burton put  it yesterday.  What appears to be Governor Gray Davis' grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes/taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new -- and far more damaging -- burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up.  There is no doubt that this use of money by SoCal Edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law, but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms.  Were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below, these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult.  Keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that Davis, his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing.   A ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re-establishing full  public control over the electric utilities.  Even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period.   That's something California cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate.   Court Battle Thus, legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in Los Angeles that SoCal Edison and PG&E are likely to win in  mid-February.  The court will most likely grant the two utilities $12.7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30%, California politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama: political cover. Davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $12.7 billion debt.  PG&E and SoCal Edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since August last year when the PUC refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared.  The court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear -- when the two utilities had repaid  so-called ""stranded costs,"" they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power.   Although the utilities won this case, the Judge stayed his order until  February 14th at the state government's request.  As that deadline  approaches, an intense new negotiating round is under way.  On the one hand,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices (""the courts made me do it""), but on the other hand, they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40% on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300% since last year.  Utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout.  ""We'll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid-February then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily.""  One tactic the state political officials are using, in order to force a  settlement, is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years.  One political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year, next year or perhaps  even the year after. ""Sure, we tell them, they will probably win in court and  get that money.  Eventually.  We are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the Supreme  Court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least.  We don't think  the creditors will be quite that patient.""",john.lavorato@enron.com,kristin.walsh@enron.com,California Update 1/31/01,2001-01-31 03:48:00-08:00,received

"Dear John,  I had a meeting with Phillip after our morning discussion about P&L and it  seems that there may be some issues regarding how I run my book.  It was my  mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked  properly.  The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners  and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the  options were not in my position.  Also, the tolls curves are not treated as  schedule C.  I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift  as needed.  My P&L did not match the Socal position because of physical index  curveshift and an adjustment to transport.    The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him  concerns me.  I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and  financial trading book within Enron.   I will stand on the fact that no one  within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than  I.  The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen  at Enron since I have been here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go  to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.    I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it  is responsible for communicating with you directly.  Let's get together and  discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.   It  may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until  this point.  This may have contributed to my miscommunication with you.  I  will see that this will not happen in the future.  Thank you for all of my  added responsibilities.

Janet did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other Enron Units have talked to her as well.  Although we met Jim's numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.  The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.  Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.

One of the main frustrations comes from many overtime hours spent working through technology issues.    Last Friday is a typical example.  The three members of our risk group were here until about 10 PM Friday night working through a problem caused by Technology.  For some reason, our Futures position was dropping out of our positions.  They noticed this and stayed until it was fixed.  It turns out that a DBA somewhere made a change that caused the mapping of our Futures positions to change.  Had this person communicated to people what he/she was doing, it is my understanding that the problem could have been avoided.  Stated another way, lack of communication by someone in technology caused our risk group to work an extra 15 hours on Friday night.  I should add that one or more people in technology had to work extra on Friday as well.  It is so frustrating to see this sort of thing happen over and over.  The list of little things that cause lots of extra work is so long that it is not funny.  It kills morale and burns out smart, hard working people.

" After a great deal of work the Canadian team has renewed our outsourcing arrangement with PetroCanada for another 5 years.  This was a great accomplishment for Enron Canada.

Let me know if you require something further.      ---------------------- Forwarded by Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT on 02/23/2001 05:11 PM --------------------------- From: Eric LeDain on 02/23/2001 09:11 AM To: Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Extension of Petro-Canada Wholesale Gas Services Arrangement for 5 more years  On Wednesday the President of Petro-Canada approved the extension of our Wholesale Gas Services Agreement after the first term expires November 1, 2002, for an incremental 5 years.  This has taken me a a while to get closed (and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service), but keep in mind it's not easy to renew something half way through the first term.  This extension is very significant for the following reasons: 1. It creates a MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN, net of directly attributable costs to provide the back-office services; 2. It supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income (along with all the production information etc.); 3. Of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across Canada.  As you know, we have used the Petro-Canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide, not only when marketing in Canada but also in the US and Europe.  Now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years, but they've liked it so much they've already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service.   Obviously this is a great credit to our Commercial staff and the Operations, Accounting and IT staff that work with Petro-Canada.   I will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them.  It takes alot of effort to ""enchant"" the customer day after day, year after year.  In fact it's incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider.   The numbers: Under the extension, we have provided Petro-Canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee. Original base fee is $1.75 MM CDN per year, payable monthly.  Rebate offered: Jan/01 - Nov/01    ($458,300) CDN Nov/01 - Nov/02   ($517,000) CDN Fee charged for extension term: Nov/02 - Nov/03   $1,366,000 CDN Nov/03 - Nov/04   $1,400,000 CDN Nov/04 - Nov/05   $1,435,000 CDN Nov/05 - Nov/06   $1,470,000 CDN Nov/06 - Nov/07   $1,510,000 CDN   We have thoroughly defined our back-office costs required to provide these services at $428,700 CDN/yr (2000$), and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection (with escalation at 2% per year) for the second five year term.  These costs include back-office staff allocations (salaries and benefits), and rent/infrastructure allocation.  We have checked on the allocation of Houston costs, and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels.  We do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow. In discussions with Wes, this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope, will allow us to MTM this income.  The MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term, and has been reduced by the above annual costs.  Notes: 1.  We have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with PCOG on what our benchmark should be, given that much of the intermediate Producers in the group of 40 have disappeared.  We will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to. 2. If Petro-Canada's sales volumes fall to 60% of last years levels, there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate.  We also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140% of today's levels.  Petro-Canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected.  Volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7-8% year on year. 3. Peter and I should have the amended agreement out next week.

"I know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions.  1)  It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart.  Under the current limits the Central desk can have    a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger.   2)  When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses.    VAR LIMITS  DESK P/L     EAST   $10 MILLION  ($66.1) MILLION     CENTRAL $12 MILLION  ($13.9) MILLION     TEXAS $8  MILLION  $55.8   MILLION  3)  It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as Tom & I.  There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated.  In fact   in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR   limit.    The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit.    (For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000.  If the     situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.)   This method I believe makes for an even playing field.  Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no   one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules.    Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance.   Thanks,  Jim",john.lavorato@enron.com,jim.schwieger@enron.com,VAR LIMITS,2001-04-24 13:41:40-07:00,received
"John, Rick asked me to forward the atteched to you directly.  __________________    __________________   I spoke with Bill Hawkins (Premier's Office)  to day and made the following  points: a) the messages from the Premier/Wilson are still ambiguous and  unclear; b) we will need clarification on three questions: 1) Is May 2002 a  deadline (as per Wilson) or a target (as per Harris)?; 2) Is the gov't still  prepared to consider a Fall opening if the 4 conditions are met?; and 3) Is  the return of  the first Pickering A unit a pre-condition to market opening?  - if it is, then any question about a Fall opening is moot since the earliest  that unit will come back is December 31, 2001 (and more likely  later).                          I did not press Bill for answers today but  indicated that we would need clarification on these issues as soon as  possible to stay engaged in the way that he wants us to. I outlined the  interpretation that we had been encouraged  by Ministry of Energy to put on  the message.  Importantly, Bill did not ""shut down"" our preferred  interpretation.                                     Bill made three points:  a) the critical factor in the announcement was continuing concern about the  circumstances in California and the difficulties that California presents for  making the decision to press ahead this year;   b) on the political front,  the key opposition to moving ahead will come from the NDP rather than the  Liberals: he wants us to help keep the Liberals on the sidelines;  and c) the  gov't  (Ministry of Energy) is going to work on fleshing out over the next  several weeks how they will assess when the 4 conditions will be satisfied  and he wanted our help in that  process.                                             I told Bill that we  wanted to stay engaged but that our immediate interest was getting  appropriate clarification of the message.                        Following  Bill's call, I heard from Joel Singer, VP at OPG, who indicated that Floyd  Laughren had assured OPG yesterday that the OEB was still targeting a Fall  opening in its retail readiness efforts.  Singer did indicate, however, that  OPG's  own demand supply assessment was not  as positive as our own and that  concerns about the demand/suppy balance was continuing to be a big hurdle to  get over.                            The IMO is also sticking with its  testing/commissioning timeline and is not altering it in light of the  announcement on Monday.                          `                ",john.lavorato@enron.com,aleck.dadson@enron.com,Ontario Market Opening,2001-04-25 04:51:00-07:00,received

I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this  process.

"John,  Attached are the sensitivities on the Petrobras deal you asked for.  The speadsheet contains three sheets:  Sheet 1:  Pay Out Diagram  Sheet 2:  Petrobras:  MTM Sensitivity in which the options shown in the Pay Out Diagram for 2002 and 2003 are repriced for each move of the forward curve.  The volatility curve is held constant.  Sheet 3:  Petrobras:  Intrinsic Value Analysis - Price Curve Sensitivities in which volatility is assumed to be zero.  This represents the value if our price forecast were 100% accurate and the structure with Petrobras were to be finalized as presented.  Kind of an area under the curves analysis.  Note:  In both Sheets 2 & 3 the 2004-2011 piece is estimated as an area under the curve (volatility = 0).  That is why it does not change.  If you have any questions, please call.

Enron has a obligation to the banks under the total return swap confirm for the $30.2MM plus accrued interest (the only dif. is that it does not show up on the balance sheet).  CIBC is at risk for $946K plus yeild if the sale of the asset is less than $31.2 and the origional owner of the asset (ENA) could take a hit if the proceeds of the asset sale does not equal the amount monitized (ie the full $31.2)      -----Original Message----- From:  Delacey, Charles   Sent: Wednesday, May 02, 2001 3:29 PM To: Pruett, Steve Subject: RE: Hawaii Sec 125 Trust  Steve, Joe was down here when i got your message.

Could one of you confirm with John via email that there is no implicit (or explicit) guarantee to CIBC from Enron on the performance of the investments sold to CIBC.  Am I correct in thinking that CIBC invested +/- $17 MM (3%) of equity in the deal?  On a related matter, I informed the CGAS executive team that Enron will initiate a sales process within the next two weeks and will return to Columbus in mid-May with our divestment advisor.  Books would go out in late June, dataroom in July, offers in August and in Q4, possibly late Q3.  Drilling results are strong as is cash flow (2001E EBITDA of $10-11 MM vs. $4.8 MM in 1999, $9.2 MM in 2000), Appalachian gas reserves are of interest to a broader set of participants today than last year, we have a better track record, and E&P companies' access to capital is much better now than it was when we pulled the failed offering this time last year (indicated equity value of $15 MM).    Therefore, I am confident Enron will net $2-5 MM more than the sale price to CIBC of $31.2 MM.  Steven H.

"My suggestions:  1) Mountains (Jackson Hole, Aspen, Banff) are a nice respite from the Houston summer.  San Diego (or the Baja peninsula) are also nice - can combine golf, fishing and all kinds of outdoor activities.  More exotic locales could include Dominican Republic, Cabo San Lucas (5 championship courses in vicinity), Virgin Islands, Bermuda.  I'm not a big fan of Las Vegas (although there is some good golf in the area).  2) Focus should be on (i) improving communication across business units (I'm surprised by the number of people on this e-mail that I don't know (well)) - perhaps presentations by each business unit reviewing 2000 and 1H 2001, (ii) identifying opportunities to profit from volatility in commodity and financial markets, (iii) create a ""road map"" strategic plan for the balance of 2001 and full year 2002.  3) I love mountain climbing (lived in Switzerland for four years) and am happy to organize beginner course and/or expedition with trained mountaineers.  Great team building therapy.  Otherwise, I'm always up for golf, deep sea fishing, go kart racing, kayaking, skeet shooting, paint ball.  4) Occasional off-sites are a great way to build/maintain morale and make sure everyone's on the same page regarding strategy/direction.

Should we fail to close this transaction, we should look to our  potential alternatives for withdrawing from the fund, unless of course we  view that we will close but it will happen over the few days following.     Interestingly, AIG may be planning to use further funds raised to create a  second fund rather than add to the current fund leaving us with more of a  percentage ownership but less capability of accessing the deals (fuel supply,  despatch and EPC rights would not be attached to any second fund).  We also have far too many people talking to AIG now and we need to stop this  immediately, going forward only Joe Deffner should communicate with Bob as at  the moment we have too many people doing all of the work for AIG for no  return.  As of Friday or the close of Alamac - Bob can only talk through  Joe.  We are not in the business of doing work for this fund.  Can you put together (only if we fail to close) a short review for John of  why we should stay in the fund over removing ourselves.  I recognize that  contractually we have no capability of exiting at this point but I know you  think differently and I hope you are right.  My view is that we need to get  out as we have no control over their investments.

"John, as to your questions on business meetings.  We should have 2 large business meetings per year.  These meetings would include all of the business units under you.  The meetings should occur sometime during the 1st Qtr and 3rd Qtr ( March and July).  The meetings should be held in Houston at offsite location (Woodlands etc.).  That would allow those coming into Houston to plan other meetings in the Houston office if needed.  The first of these meetings would be to present each business unit plan, market strategy, target markets, product and service offerings and address any and all questions. The idea would be to discuss specific ideas and directions and not have a vague "" we are going to work hard"" type of agenda.  The primary objective would be to set, early in the year, the right track for success.  The 2nd meeting would be an update and re-setting of direction as necessary.  The agenda would be as follows  Day 1 - Wednesday morning.  Open for travel, individual meetings, golf, any other activity  Wednesday afternoon. Business presentations  Wednesday evening. Dinner and activity .  Buses to Dave and Busters, Night golf tournament, motivational business speaker, group bonding.  Day 2 -Thursday - business presentations throughout day with group activity as discussed above in evening (do not have afternoon activity, stay focused on business presentations).  Golf, etc will be before and after business agenda but not during.    Day 3 - Friday - open for return travel, individual meetings, group activity.  Alternative: The second meeting could be held in a location other then Houston.  Perhaps one of the regional offices or a central location that could offer a unique group activity such as whitewater rafting, paint- ball, sailing, gambling, mountain climbing (even though you are not a bid for mountain climbing), Climbing Mt Hood in Portland could be a great thing for the group to do.  2.    Other then the meetings discussed above each region ( East, West, Canada, other) should have QBR's.  These do not need to be full day sessions.  Half days should be enough.

One idea:  perhaps we could ask Devon to help us = send residential customers a letter showing them 100 ways to reduce their e= nergy bill by changing their behavior or spending less than $100 at Home De= pot on energy conservation enablers.  Then, as part of our good by, we coul= d send them a $100 gift certificate to Home Depot.

Since our company is based on = helping our customers create extra value, and since we can't find any extra=  value, we will be moving you back to utility service.  As we go, don't let=  it be said that we aren't always thinking about creating extra value, so h= ere are 100 ideas and a $100 dollar certificate to home depot.

"We are concluding the valuation and booking of the Modesto Maranzana transaction. The final point that needs to be agreed upon to properly book the transaction is the year 5 terminal value of the plant.   The model currently represents a terminal value of $7.5 million based upon subjective rational. We have analysed the market and economic situation thoroughly and believe it is appropriate to accurately represent the terminal value as $12 million. The rational and economic analysis is covered in the below e mail.   I would like to discuss this with you sometime today. I will call to see if we can set up a short discussion. Let me know if you would like Vlady to participate.  Based upon getting your concurence and the final review of the model with Joe we should be ready to book the transaction early next week.  MFG   ---------------------- Forwarded by Michael Guerriero/SA/Enron on 05/17/2001 10:33 AM ---------------------------   Michael Guerriero 05/08/2001 03:50 PM To: Vladimir Gorny/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Maria Ines Granado/SA/Enron@Enron, Mario Aguilar Benitez/SA/Enron@Enron   Subject: Modesto Maranzana Terminal Value  We need to review the terminal value issue in the 5 year model. As we have discussed and John, I believe, agreed we do not believe salvage value is relevant in this short term time frame. I would also argue an arbitrary number such as $7.5 million is also not reflective of the true value in year five.  We have already received a verbal indication from Duke that they would have an interest in the facility at $9 - $11 million. Based upon Duke's minimal due diligence this is relevant in reconfirming our initial valuation and reflecting that there is demand for power generation assets in Argentina.   In addition we believe the most accurate reflection of terminal value in year 5 is closer to our initial purchase price of $12 million. The below valuations, local market grid assessment, and our forward power curve support this conclusion.  1) Market Multiple of EBITDA Valuation:  There are two ""public"" companies that are currently trading on the local stock exchange, the Merval. Central Puerto and Central Costanera. Both are thermal power units in Argentina.  On average the EBITDA multiple for these companies is equal to four (3.8 + 4.2))2 = 4  Modesto Maranzana assumes an EBITDA of approximately $3 million.   MMPP EBITDA $ 3 MM x 4 = $ 12 MM  This is again supportive of our valuation of $12 million     2) Most Recent Market Transaction Valuation:  On Average the last 3 power acquisition transactions in the market were above $230 kW and the current market average is $213 kW. Based upon MMPP's installed capacity of 70 Mw and using the market average of $213 kW the plant could be valued as high as $14.9 million. This is again supports a conservative valuation of $12 million or $171 per kW.             3) Rio Cuarto Grid Constraint Value Impact: There currently exist constraints in the Rio Cuarto Node that will make MMPP very strategic in terms of the short term avoided cost of a network expansion. In turn there will be a premium value associated with maintaining the plant in the Rio Cuarto area. This premium would logically come in two forms:   A.  The pending buyer of EPEC would enter into a commercial transaction with the plant to secure its position in the region. The format of the agreement would be a market based power contract with a premium demand charge or in the form of an obligatory agreement to maintain the plant in the area in recognition of a fixed annual fee.   B. A related company of the company that buys EPEC in the pending privatisation would purchase the plant to secure its position in the region in recognition of the avoided cost associated with a grid expansion.  The avoided costs of the expansion projects are estimated to be between $4 and $16 million.       4) Forward Power Price Value Impact It is also relevant that Argentine power is contango and that in year 5 we will be in a more favourable scenario regarding forward power prices as noted below. This will support a stronger valuation at such time.       Loan Structure  In addition I would like to solicit structuring the loan to be more reflective of cash flows in year 1. Under normal circumstances we try to structure a loan recognising the financial impact of the maintenance program. In light of this I request the loan be structured as interest only March 1, 2001 to December 31, 2001 and interest and principal there after.

"John:  The purpose of the call tomorrow at 9:00 am is to update you on the status of the MHI turbines and to discuss an alternative structure.  The following are the different approaches that we are currently pursuing with respect to the turbines:  I am working with two brokers in the US for the sale of turbine 2.  At this point, there are discussions on-going with three or four parties interested in the turbine.  We are targeting an end of June close. We have offered the RioGen site for sale with turbines.  We currently have received two indicative offers.  Tractabel has offered to purchase the site with turbines 3 and 4 for an approximate $10 to $15 million gain.  AES is offering to buy the site with turbines 2, 3 and 4 under a fixed price EPC concept.  The amount and schedule of their initial offer was tight (in addition to the fact that we do not have any desire to take EPC risk).  AES will reply with a new offer in the next few days based on our initial feedback with these thoughts.  El Paso will provide us an offer within 10 days.  Duke may also be interested. Petrobras has continued to push us on the RioGen project.  They have received a new mandate to increase capacity given the deteriorating situation in the market with rationing and would be interested in purchasing the turbines and site from us at a minimum.  The latest proposal and potential structure from Petrobras includes an offer from Petrobras to work with an Eletrobolt type structure, but also give Enron a put of the project if we decide not to proceed with construction at a certain point in the future.  Attached is an outline of the basic structure of a potential deal.  We would like to discuss the feasability of such a deal given our previous discussions.  I understand your position in the past on similar projects, but I feel that this might be a potential solution which addresses the risk of the turbine position and gives us significant optionality on capacity.

"John,  I think that diversification here is key. Provided that the correlation between power and gas or between different regions is less than 1 (which is almost always the case), simply spreading the investment over other commodities/regions will increase portfolio returns (i.e. same nominal P&L, less volatility).  More specifically, I would suggest the following:  1. ratchet up West ""Bets""  - I think that Tim is playing defense as of late ($7 MM P&L this month vs $600 MM in the last four months), yet he is one of the best traders   and has the highest return on VaR for the past couple of years  - Q4 Palo at $140 looks cheap as compared to MidC at $240, Q2-02 prices in the $80s look cheap as well  - I will get more specific strategies on Friday after my return from Portland   - Cash trading - spot prices in the West were up ~$100 today  2. East desk has taken risk down in the last few days after making $122 MM this month alone. They need to reassess where they stand today and act appropriately. Some ideas are:  - Long NY power  - I would assess getting long SE/SERC this summer at prices below $100  3. NG Desk  - NE: Long NY and Florida in anticipation of tight power and transmission/transportation constraints this summer  - What is Tom Martin's secret - consistently high return on VaR and consistently positive P&L. Can it be replicated on other desks?  4. SA - get long power in Brazil by all means: close the Petrobras deal, any other prospects?  In general, I would challenge every region head to come up and describe profitable strategies (other than Nymex), based on their expertise, fundamentals, weather, etc.  Other wild ideas:   5. Buy aluminum and steel - since a lot of smelters have been closed because of high electricity prices, aluminum and steel should get expensive  6. I am in Vegas the weekend of July 12th.

"John -  What are your thought s on location of EES' Gas desk - current head count = 47.  FYI, we just assigned Jim Homco to this group to address commercial and operational issues.  Is there any space on 6 with ENA's Gas desk?  We have had discussions lately re: the many areas where potential integration efficiencies could be achieved, such as having a retail fixed price rep sit on Lagrosta's desk to achieve more timely and accurate prices for non-swap products.  We could fit the group on 5, but the functional benefit just isn't there.  Also, does Sally Beck's group provide the confirms/contract/risk services for ENA's gas desk as it does for ENA Power?  If so, shouldn't Sally be involved in retail?  These guys are really behind in this respect and it is a big factor in ongoing losses and commercial imperfections.

"John -  FYI.  From what I vave seen thus far I think it will be difficult getting a= nything accurate or timely out of Evan Hughes' group.  This is the group th= at is responsible for billing and settlements - the weakest link in our rec= onciliation problems.  Unlike ENA Power, Retail has Deal Capture and Risk A= nalysis under Sally Beck and the Settlements process under EES (Evan Hughes= ).  All three of these functions need to work together and feed into Wade S= tubblefield (Wes Colwell) in order to get an accurate and timely reconcilia= tion.  Dave has wanted to keep Billing and Settlements because of the ""Cust= omer Touch"" they want to maintain.

"John -  The current functional reporting structure of Billing & Settlement's through EES poses near term and long term tactical risks we  feel jeopardizes our ability to meet our goals and objectives.  Currently, Deal Capture and Risk Analysis/Reporting report through Sally Beck.  However, Settlements and Billing report through Evan Hughes (EES).  As such, the reconciliation process (Wes Colwell and Wade Stubblefield) is held hostage to any piece that breaks down.  In this structure we (ENA) are able to control the progress and performance of Deal Capture and Risk Reporting.  We are making progress on these fronts.  We are completely out of the loop re: current state of affairs on the billing side (other than it just doesn't work).  We are also out of the loop in assuring the proper approach and solutions are being  implemented.    According to Anthony Dayao and other, there are approximately 11 different billing systems that feed CSC (we outsource billing to CSC apparently).  Billing Group spent several months attempting to scope out the process and future requirements.  This was done in conjunction with Union Finosa.  I think that approximately $6.8 MM has been spent to date on this effort w/ Union Finosa (Anthony, is this accurate).  Union Fin recently provided the group with a proposal and Anthony has negotiated 60 - 90 days to review and respond (Apparently, Billing wanted to go forward with just one week of comments).  Bottom Line:  this does not appear to be the proper approach to ensuring that we are solving our comprehensive billing/settlement issues as well as near term necessities.  PROPOSED SOLUTION: Billing/Settlements should report to Sally Beck (dotted lines to ENA and EES) EES can maintain customer interface through call centers and logo on invoice Convene an immediate meeting with Evan Hughes, Anthony Dayao et. al. to summarize current state (including Union Fenosa) Retain Accenture or KPMG to fully scope out current reality vs. business needs Implement action plan to address long term solution vs short term necessity.  Until we can resolve this, I am afraid that 1) decisions are being made without full consideration of ENA's view of business needs and 2) ENA cannot be accountable for when and if we can ever provide monthly reconciliations and flash to actuals.  As we all recognize, unless you can reconcile the books, you really don't have a legitimate business.  John, could we convene a meeting if necessary for you to address these issues.

All have registered a lot of time on Dealbench.  Northland brought there investment bankers (CIBC) to Portland and hired an independent engineering firm.  We will have the info memorandum prepared this week tosend out to other potential purchasers if necessary.  Still on track.  AMPS: We are negotiating with two industrials, each can take the first two units.  Oregon Steel in Portland and Geneva Steel in Utah.  Geneva is a better site (permitting and infrastructure).  High elevation in Utah will derate the output of the units, but will likely be able to run most hours.  Oregon interconnects with Portland General (good) but permit will restrict hours (3,500 hours estimate).  We need to talk this week to discuss the form of the contract and value/risk transfer between ENA and AMPS.  Wind:   We completed a term sale to Edwards Air Force Base consisting of shaped energy and green tags.  Tags came from our existing biomass tags and Texas wind.  We will purchase the balance from Pacificorp.  We expect more activity here with other feds, some of the munis and 6-7 developers that we are working with.  Generator Tolls: We are trading term sheets with Allegheny, Reliant, Idacorp, Dynegy, NRG and Constellation re our offer to sell at NP-15, Mid-C and Palo - I think we will get something done this quarter.  Longview: We met with the head of BPA this week and got confirmation that he supports our Longview process and that his agency will not slow us down with their proposed regional air study.  Finding EPC contractors has been difficult so we may start discussions with NEPCO.  DWR: Should execute the Master agreement this week which will allow short-term deals with 7 day payment.

"John,  I hate to whine, but...  EES: Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are pitching.

He heads up an Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan or should I?

"John,  As we have discussed before, it appears that combining Texas gas and power origination activities is not going to work.  The final nail in the coffin is the fact that in the new building we continue to be on two different floors.  As a result, I would like your thoughts about how to manage the origination activities in Texas.  In my mind there are several possible solutions:   1.  Have Barry Tycholiz manage both the West and Texas origination  2.  Combine EES Texas retail with wholesale under Mark Courtney (EES has been chasing wholesale gas business in Texas)  3.  Have Brian Redmond manage Texas origination (Delainey suggested it; I don't know what you have planned for him but he has contacts with the TRC and       customers)  Also, I am continuing to interview for one trader and for one middle marketer with the assistance of Todd Piekert in HR.  He has been identifying third rotation associates for me.  One of the candidates that I have been talking to is Charles Weldon who was approved into the trading track program yesterday.  I am going to talk to him again soon, I would like to be able to have him assigned to my desk either as a trader or originator depending where his skills best fit.

Mrha  -----Original Message----- From:  Mrha, Jean   Sent: Thursday, May 31, 2001 8:32 PM To: Kitchen, Louise Cc: Schoppe, Tammie Subject: Dissolution of Production Offshore Importance: High   Louise,  I hope that everything is well with you.  Much has happened during the past two weeks and I will try to be as brief as possible.  Based on conversations and internal decisions that have occurred, Tom Byargeon and myself have decided to dissolve Production Offshore by the end of second quarter.  I have spoken with John regarding this commercial structural change and have also renegotiated the 2001 Upstream Products expected margin to $30 MM.  (The expected budget from Production Offshore was $20 MM out of the $50 MM for Upstream Products.) I have attached a document that Tom has drafted outlining the remaining project responsibilities, market representation, and personnel redeployment.  The following individuals within Production Offshore have yet to be redeployed :  1. Tom Byargeon - He has been offered an opportunity to work with Randy Maffett, Vice President - Wholesale Origination, EGM.  Tom also will be meeting with Dave Duran tomorrow morning to discuss opportunities that exist within Generation Investments or Northeast Power Origination.    In addition, I want him to consider leading the Ecommerce/ Producer One effort for Upstream Products.  I desperately need a dedicated senior commercial person with contract negotiations expertise that can also see the financing opportunities that exist for Producer segment (i.e., wellhead connects, metering and monitoring equipment, etc.) through a Producer One transaction.  However, Tom has surmised that higher commercial visibility will be achieved by working on the financing of large asset deals within EGM or perhaps, in Duran's group.  I have assured him that the commercialization of the back and mid office is just as important if not more important to Enron's upper management.  Plus, I feel the closing of these outsourcing transactions will be more numerous by the end of the year than the other origination opportunities offered.  I know that he greatly respects your opinion.  If you could contact him (x30650) or drop him an email with your commercial perspective, I am sure that the correspondence would be greatly appreciated.   2. Kevin Miller - mostly likely will focus on marketing and closing Producer ecommerce transactions.  In addition, Kevin has a very strong crude and processing background.  This experience would complement the Producer One effort as well support the processing needs of the Wellhead desk.  He could have career opportunities with EGM, but overall, is very enthusiastic about ENA's Producer ecommerce commercial platform.  3. Kenn Loch - has a very technical background suited for deepwater projects.  Since the responsibility for Mariner is within ECR, Allan Keel may be interested in his background.  Also, since the responsibility for the MEGS/Pluto deal should be transferred to ECR,  Kenn would be an appropriate resource for that transaction as well.  4. Lisa Druzbik -  is very familiar with the accounting details behind MEGS/ Pluto.  Has opportunities are within ECR and EES.  Most of her background is within the E&P sector.  I have spoken with Scott Josey about the impending dissolution of Production Offshore.  Since MEGS/Pluto is a deal with Mariner (and since Enron owns 97% of Mariner, the deal is analogous to doing a transaction with oneself), he concurs with me that the transaction should be evaluated with the overall restructure or potential sale of Mariner.  Should I transfer over to ECR all 2001 capital charges and associated earnings related to MEGS/Pluto?  Should this transfer occur as of the beginning of the year or at the end of second quarter? The YTD margin associated with this project is approximately $ 3 MM.  I look forward to hearing from you.

"John, I want to re-confirm your approval to enter into a new lease. We need to give notice to Canterra by end of June on whether we are extending for an additional 3 years to June 2005 or terminating our lease June 2002.   I'm currently negotiating on 3 different sites as well as discussing the extension with Oxford:  Canterra  3 year lease - no renewal rights - $26sq/ft at 20,000 sq. ft. No ability to expand contiguously. Currently, at capacity.  TCPL Tower  Conoco has 3 floors (26,27,28 at 25,000 sq.ft/floor). With Gulf takeover, they will consolidate into Gulf Square. Looking for 3 floor     sub-lease tenant. Likely $25/sq.ft 10 year lease w/renewal rights. Good floor-plate (column-free rectangle). One floor would likely be    adequate for the next few years. Would overlap canterra lease by likely 9 months.  Bankers Hall  Calpine has 2 floors (39,40 at 19,000 sq.ft/floor). With Encal takeover, they will consolidate into Canada Trust. Looking for 2 floor     sub-lease tenant. Likely $25/sq.ft. 10 year lease w/renewal rights. One floor would be less than adequate - 2 floors would be more     than we need for the next few years. Would overlap canterra lease by likely 9 months.  Phillips Warehouse 2 floor warehouse being converted to 3 floor office bldg. 10 year lease w/renewal rights on 35,000 sq.ft at $20sq/ft. Will build to suit and    Enron would have building naming rights. Timing with expiry of Canterra lease is good (Occupy date would be 1st qtr, 2002).   My preference is to target the Phillip's brothers warehouse.Timing, location, price, sq.footage, parking all look good. They are willing to deal with us exclusively and have aspirations of designing a state-of-the-art office building (this is consistent with their reputation) while Calpine/Conoco want to free-option us while they look for multi-floor tenants (much like what happened when we made an offer on TCPL tower previously and they used it to lever Hunt Oil into a mulit-floor lease).    Let me know your thoughts on this as I need to move fairly quickly.    ---------------------- Forwarded by Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT on 06/04/2001 10:27 AM ---------------------------   Rob Milnthorp 02/14/2001 09:06 AM To: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron cc:   Subject: Enron Canada Office Space  John, first off, congrats on your promotion!   You may recall that our Canterra lease expires June, 2002. When we consolidated our floor space on 35, we were able to incorporate an option to extend the 35th floor lease (at market rate approx $24 sq.ft) for an additional 3 years to June, 2005. Notice to extend has to be provided June of this year.   The reason I'm bringing this to your attention is that I'm concerned that we will not be able to accomodate any growth for years 2002 - 2005 in our current space. We will be at 115 employees this summer (150 sq. ft./employee) and our max is 130 (135 sq.ft/employee) which should get us through June 2002.  Given this, I have explored a number of leasing opportunities outside of Canterra with the goal of finding a floor plate more conducive to a trading organization. You may recall that TransCanada was in the process of building a new office tower across from Esso Plaza. They are now in the process of sub-leasing a number of the floors.   The tower was designed for their own trading organization and is the largest column-free floor plate in Canada (28,000 sq. ft.). It's state of the art technology includes a raised floor system for wiring (ie no coring). Coral Canada recently leased two floors in the tower for their Canadian trading operation.   We are looking at the 31st floor at $24 sq. ft for a 10 year term with some overlap with our current lease for build-out. At 135 sq. ft/employee we would be able to staff 200 employees. However, given the rectangular/column-free floor plate, we probably could get down to 100 sq. ft/employee (270 employees). This should be sufficient for many years to come.

"John,  I spoke with WitCapital's investment banking and equity syndication groups today regarding internet distributed IPOs.  Confirming some of our earlier research, the internet is used as one of several distribution channels for an IPO, not the sole distribution channel.  This is not to say that a 100% internet distributed IPO can not be done, however.  Although, WitCapital said they would not do one.    WitCapital emphasized the need for a large (>50%) stock distribution to instutional investors in an IPO.  70% to 80% allocation is typical.  To this end, the bank has hired an institutional sales force, which uses the telephone rather than the internet to sell.    In WitCapital's opinion, an IPO with 70% to 80% institutional allocation and 20% to 30% retail allocation is an optimal structure which maximizes the price obtained by the issuer.  Such higher price would presumably more than offset the higher cost of a typical IPO versus an internet distributed IPO.  In addition, WiCapital's opinion is that the liquidity and trading evironment would be healthier for a typical IPO versus an internet distributed IPO, which would give the stock support in a secondary offering whereby the issuer is unloading its holdings.  Please let me know if you would like for us to do additional research on this topic.

After talking with Phillip Love who is the Central Risk lead, it seems the traders are always away from their desks when it's time to load curves.

"Sumas has been priced flat or weaker to AECO, so there  has been less gas going North from Stanfield and less gas hitting Sumas because of the outage.

" As anticipated when the constraints of having  the ""luck of the draw"" taken out of the equation, I have moved into a first  place draw with Headley Jones in our newly formatted hockey pool. I never  once drew first pick in all previous Uncle Buzzy pools (remember him?) , so  this feels particularly sweet. With one game left, all I need is one point  from either Jason Arnott or Beretta Blake to stand alone. My only worry is a  Brodeur shut-out.   I offered Don Headley a split earlier when I was 7  points back, but he chose to poke fun instead. Charles, whose not even in the  pool, cried collusion, to which I explained to him that for this to be the case,  1. Discussions would have had to be held ""in camera""  and 2. Others would have to be negatively impacted.  Neither of these criteria were met. I was simply being a good  capitalist.

I know  Glove is very interested this year, and I'm sure Lav could be pried away from  cooking his companies books for a long week-end. We could always do Tremblant  again, but I'm in Mack's corner (for the first time ever!) in stating that I  could care less if we golf!!! Perhaps we could do Vegas, visit Lav or Glove (  which their respective wives would love) or simply go to my cottage. It doesn't  really matter, as long as we're together for a few laughs!!!!!!

"So, like we were saying earlier, there is less gas flowing North around the horn at Stanfield. The outage schedule is as follow: Pine River is back on June 12, and Fort Nelson starts on June 14 until June 27 (280mmcf), then 290 mmcf off on June 29 at McMahon. If prices are not motivated to move to Malin, it will back off in Alberta, either through Gordondale, or displacing gas at Kingsgate.   The story for the other small storage facilities on Northwest Pipeline is:  We were told that Mist is approximately 25% full, but it has a capacity of only 9 bcf     Plymouth has approximately has a capacity of less than 3 bcf.  Clay is taking its gas from the Rockies. We think there is enough supply to offset any additional capacity from Sumas, so Canadian gas should not be used for injection in Clay. Clay is already about 3 bcf over last year (23.7 bcf vs 20.9 bcf, on a capacity of 54.5 bcf. Last year they were only 83% full).   I hope this helps.

Cc: Herndon, Rogers; Richter, Jeff Subject: FYI - Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower   To all,  The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points.    Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, Ancillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest structures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the same time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's current state.  Quick statistics for ONE site:  Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) took 8-9 hours to book. Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book). Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours. Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value. All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals.  Recommendations:  Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accounting, etc. In the interim:  Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift, reg switch options, and new deals.

Work with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower.  Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time. Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We had gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this. At times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from entering any new data.  Week 3 (May 29-June 1)  Finished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day price, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the curves as $/Kw-month. Again, we ran into problems with the test database. Completed booking in Enpower.

Cc: Herndon, Rogers; Richter, Jeff Subject: FYI - Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower   To all,  The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points.    Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, Ancillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest structures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the same time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's current state.  Quick statistics for ONE site:  Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) took 8-9 hours to book. Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book). Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours. Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value. All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals.  Recommendations:  Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accounting, etc. In the interim:  Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift, reg switch options, and new deals.

The specific issues are as follows:  ? Encorp - the value of this investment was written up from $3 million to $9.85 million in Q4 2000 without justification.  It should be written back down at the end of this quarter.  Otherwise, we are going to have a bigger problem later. ? Dais Analytic - same issue as above.  Investment was written up from $8 million to $20 million.  It should be written back down this quarter. ? AMPS - This is a problem.  This company is going to continue to need capital (an additional $7 million immediately) well beyond what Enron should be funding.  I am not willing to provide this company with ongoing funding without significant further evaluation.  If it is that important to the strategic effort of ENA, then I recommend that ENA continue to manage the company and provide financing. ? Bridgeline - After further evaluation, it is clear that this is not a merchant investment and should not be moved to my group.  I spoke with Jeff Donahue, and we both agree that if you want it sold, then his team should be the right one to do it. ? Copel - This one is fuzzy, but Jeff Donahue and I have agreed that one of us should take responsibility for exiting this investment.  We still need to figure this one out.

Black Hills' bid has a clean purchase and sale markup with a bid that implies a $35MM gain for ENA ($10MM has to go to Calpers since they are an investor in LV 1).  They are going to their board Thursday and want to execute by early next week and close Aug 31.  We will try to get a higher bid from Northland this week ($40MM gain).  They will require a two-week financing out which they will secure with a $10MM non-refundable deposit.  If we sign with Northland, they can close in July.  In either case, accounting may require us to recognize this income this quarter because Las Vegas is a fair market value investment.   RAC requires a DASH to sell an asset of this size - we will circulate on Wednesday or Thursday.  One long shot deal we are proposing to Allegheny:  Tear up the existing 15 year toll backed by the Las Vegas project.  Enter into a 15 year firm energy sale from EPMI at Palo Verde.  The value of that deal may be in excess of $100MM since the market has fallen so much.  If we did that, we would have a merchant asset that would have to be sold at or near cost - this is achievable.  This would be significantly riskier than our current plan and would probably require board approval, but the value makes it worth exploring.   AMPS: We continue to push Geneva Steel and Oregon Steel for permitting info.  West power markets have fallen further so the economics are marginal at best.  Friday's curves suggested a value of $10MM vs a cost of $17MM.  An imperfect put swaption would cost $4MM, further eroding the value.  I spoke to Brett Wiggs on Friday and forwarded him technical specs and reviewed different deal structures that might work.  DWR: They announced Thursday that they have signed more definitive long term deals that they will honor (approx 6,500MW long term).  The non-binding ""agreements in principle"" will be renegotiated because prices have fallen so much.  DWR signed our Master Agreement for short term deals but Tim does not want to execute it because of litigation risk.  We will not do anything with them at this time.  Generator Tolls:  Interest has fallen off due to rapid drop in power prices.  We are still talking with 6-7 parties, but I dont think anything will get done soon.    Munis:  Mcdonald got a small term sale done at NP-15 with city of Lassen.  Approx $600K of orig.  New Marketing Initiatives: Negotiating 3 generator service agreements.  Mostly small plants coming on line this year.  The entrepreneurs behind these deals are shell shocked by the low prices , but many have already committed capital.    Montana: - State forced divestiture of generation.  Retail load is short starting July 1, 2002.  Governor's office has asked us to bring a 700MW 10 year ""solution"".  They are willing to issue a $500MM bond to prepay and buydown part of the energy.  The basic play is to swap an EPMI Mid-C position for an in-state position from PPL, package that up with some renewables and sell to the state under a prepaid PPA.  Long shot but interesting.  CA Industrials:  A group of industrials want to buy up to 800MW NP-15 delivered for 5+ years as part of a negotiated settlement with CA.  Gov Affairs is working on a Core/Non-Core structure with the state that would potentially lead to open access for all industrial load if they pay a big exit fee to cover the stranded costs incurred during the past 12 months.

"I sent you an update of the Hedge Summary for July 3, 2001.  In that I mentioned that I bought 125 MW of Cal02 at 10 HR flat.  I am long over 500 MW at this heat rate.  The biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that tanks the Mid-C (i.e. uncorrelated event with gas).  Mid-C off-peak is $47 USD, Nymex fixed price for Cal02 is $3.79 USD and Sumas basis is $0.16 for Cal02.  This implies a heat rate of close to  11.9 for the off-peak Mid-C.  I am thinking about buying back some AECO gas hedge for Cal02, then selling Mid-C off-peak to replace the gas hedge.  Perhaps as winter blow-out protection, buy some Jan-Feb Sumas basis.    The trade for a 25 MW long Alberta flat position would be:    a) sell 25 MW of Mid-C off-peak    b) buy 0.25 contracts /day of AECO fixed price Cal02 gas (i.e. to unwind the off-peak Alberta portion of the the gas hedge)    c) buy 0.25 contracts/day of Sumas Jan-Feb basis  See what you think??

Crandall done  Badeer done  Swerzbin submitted comments on Monday;  feedback will be given to him today - some met some not;  Mike's comments on our feedback due on Monday;  should be in a position to execute next week.  Heizenrader is good on numbers and still talking language.  Final issues relate to language about breaking laws or regulations and all of the accusations that are out there about Enron and it's employees breaking laws and regulations.  Michele Cash has talked to Sanders and Haedicke about this stuff.  Tim H., Michele, Amy Fitzpatrick (HR Generalist in PDX) and I met today.  We think that we have arrived at language that will work for everyone.  Ball is in Michele's court to turn another draft around to us.  Belden - I am good on the numbers.  I have have concerns about indemnity against California and West Power related lawsuits.  I also want to formalize the arrangement that I have with Haedicke with respect to Enron covering my legal fees associated with the west power investigations.  Michele is going to take a cut at some language.  She also needs to convince me that I am covered by the Directors and Officers indemnifications which are part of Enron's bylaws and Delaware law.  Richter - he's been lame about giving me his comments.  I've been lame about riding him on it.  I will do that today.  Wolfe - Greg currently is considering offers from Calpine, AEP, and Enron.  AEP is offering significantly more money.  Greg needs to decide where he wants to work and who he wants to work with.  There is a very real chance that we lose him.  However, we've shown his a great bid, so we will just have to get by if he leaves for a lot of money.  When I say a lot, he is talking about guaranteed 600k per year, roughly.  Motley - has declined our offer.  The total numbers looked good, but he doesn't like Enron options.  If we took his Option value and put it into cash or restricted stock he would be done.  I mentioned it to John and he didn't want to do that.  On the one hand, if that will get him done I think that it's a great outcome.  On the other, we showed him some good numbers and I respect the fact that John wants to keep things consistent.  Tough call.  He did mention that if Enron's Treasury department would let him gamma trade his options withodd lots and no margin requirement that he would take the options.  He has a legitimate point that he has no way of assuring that he can achieve the value of the options.  It's also very hard to argue with an options trader on this point.     -----Original Message-----  From:   Kitchen, Louise   Sent:   Thursday, July 26, 2001 11:23 AM  To:     Belden, Tim  Subject:        How are we doing on the contracts?

If we take the most conservative scenario and assume that we collect upside in July 02 only, MTM is about US$6 million.  The more rationing last, the higher in the money will the deal be (of course, immediate settlement at MAE at R$684 of all long position would take us OTM, but we do not expect this to happen very soon).

This capacity was assigned with varying start dates. late 02 and early 03, with no credit risk associated with this transaction as a condition of the assignment was an unconditional release of ENA.  ENA assigned this capacity at max rate ( which meets all FERC policy issues)and we were able to generate $3.0 MM of incremental value which was granted to Stephanie Miller from Mike Grigsby.    In addition to the MTM of approx $ 3MM, this transaction reinforces the good working relationship between trading and marketing and may enhance ENA's trading position by removing some of the risks associated with this pipe. These risks include, flow rate risk, demand charge tariff changes, receipt point pool allocation risks, and potential MTM erosion and of course FERC/regulatory pressures.  Our work is nowhere near complete on this as we continue to create structures and discussion around the 200,000/day which is a little more complicated to shed. In the meantime our group continues to promote the placement of the remaining capacity either through other producers or generators and we anticipate the assignment of another  small package early next week.

The prevailing feeling was that there is no reason to start dereg if the systems cannot handle it. To their credit, however, the politicians stated that we need to know this sooner rather than later as there are significant ramifications if we are to delay it. The committee was cognizant of the financial exposure and also the erosion of public confidence in the event of a further delay.  The speed of completing customer switching is expected to ramp up now so that all pilot customers will be switched by mid to late Oct. That leaves one billing cycle before dereg. So, the latest we should know there is going to be a delay is Thanksgiving. ERCOT's past inability to inform the market of their delays should be resolved as they were heavily chastised for their commercial incompetence. The senate committee is also getting more actively involved as the skewed representation is concerning them-competitive retail has minimal voting rights.     Recent changes in pricing mechanisms show that the ISO is very sensitive to the political forum and so I believe they will be a little more responsive to their demands. That is probably why the ISO has taken to 'fixing' price by not using the market bids when liquidity is light. This increases the uplift costs which are currently estimated around $0.50 MWh.  All in all, the wholesale operations are still sub-optimal but I believe, if the switching does occur, then we should be ok. The concern is the margin for error- the ISO will know late November giving you only a month at best. Restructuring these contracts to coincide with a threshold of completed switches would be the way to go.  In the meantime, Jean Ryall is working to monitor the next round of hearings. In addition, we should be able to get access to the chairs of this committee if need be.  Let me know if you have any questions,  Doug       -----Original Message----- From:  Herndon, Rogers   Sent: Friday, September 07, 2001 10:00 AM To: Presto, Kevin M.; Lavorato, John Cc: Wagner, Joseph; Gilbert-smith, Doug Subject: ERCOT Delay Risks    Kevin/John -  I am becoming concerned that ERCOT will not achieve full open access by 1/1/02.  Our sales are virtually all commencing 1/1/02.  A delay will result in foregone margin and possible incremental losses until such time we can physically serve.  For example, we will possibly be forced to serve our customers with regulated utility gen service until such time as ERCOT can fully implement direct access.  The cost are greater than our retail gen product and greater than our sales price = loss of margin + incremental losses due to costs above sales price.  (make sense?)  I have expressed this concern to EES Origination.  Margins are extremely tight in ERCOT, approximately $2.00 Mwh above offer and if we build in a fee/reserve to account for this risk we will probably shut down the TX effort.  Our competitors (absent Shell) are apparently not considering/pricing this risk.  In fact, the incumbent utilities have a natural hedge.  If open access is delayed then their customers just continue to pay higher tariff rates, thus they are incented not to assist in a speedy transition.  I suggested that at a minimum we reserve margin until we have a better feel for transition status but obviously received no nods of approval.  I will get with Steffes on Monday to get a feel from him, and Doug if you could provide your thoughts as well.  I am afraid we may have no choice other than imposing some price component to reflect this risk which could lead to our being viewed uncompetitive in the marketplace.    One possible mitigation is to amend our contract to begin upon full transition date (or such earlier date if allowed). This would at least limit our exposure to loss of margin vs. additional incremental losses associated with our obligation to serve with reg gen.

He used the example of many trading houses that he has seen on TV in the recent news coverage as still having CRT's for their traders. Can you let me know if we currently have standard configurations both in the new and old building of what we give people at certain levels. I want us to start working on making employees understand the cost and getting them to think about saving money. We can start to do this by publishing openly the costs of each component of typical setups. We could also ask people to turn in equipment they may have that they dont need and we can redeploy (we did this effectively in Europe).

Duke's bid is C$180,000,000.  This compares to an earlier bid of C$120,000,000 to C$140,000,000 for one unit on July 10, 2001.  Duke's bid combined with the cost structure of the PPA would have Duke buying the PPA for approximately C$35.50/MW or US$22.50/MW.   The mark-to-market value of both the Sundance units as of September 18th's curves was C$178,120,374.  Therefore, a sale to Duke at C$180 MM would not provide any significant increase to earnings.  Additionally, it must be noted that the curves have some very conservative heat rate assumptions built into to the latter years.  Based on a conversation with John last week,  he clearly indicated that selling the PPA for under US$25.00/MW is not acceptable.  I would agree with John that Enron would better be served by maintaining its current position than accept a bid reflecting a price less than US$25.00 .  It must be noted that Duke's bid expires at 5:00pm CDT, September 21.  Therefore, if anyone feels strongly that we should move forward with Duke we should address it immediately.  Otherwise, Don Miller and I continue to position Enron for the division of the PPA and subsequent auction.

"In the effort to understand this better is it fair to say that wholesale block prices between Friday afternoon and today have fallen on the offer side by $7.00 MWHr?  For example, these were the prices on Friday:   Jack in the Box PG&E Offer $41.15; A/S $4.93; Block to Shape $1.25 = Total $47.33.   The total price to Jack was $60.31 and includes the following additional charges $3.03 losses, $3.40 interzonal congestion; $1.75 uplifts; $1.80 ISO charges; $0.50 settlements and $2.50 ""contract/legal"".  I don't believe ancillaries and shape have changed dramatically; therefore, it would suggest that wholesale markets have changed by the number indicated above.  Our information would suggest that SP 15 and NP 15 on-peak has not changed by this amount between Friday to today.  This leads to two results:  a) the generator price is closer to our original offer and  b) our original offer on Friday was out of market and EES paid too much for supply.

A different confirm could change these prices.  It is my understanding that the deal team has not yet agreed to the Steve Hall version of the confirm.    Please note that these prices are for a stipulated hourly shape and include CAISO energy and associated ancillary services including regulation up, regulation down, spin, non-spin, and replacement reserves.  This pricing also assumes a good credit, wholesale counterparty with no regulatory contingencies or recission rights.  It also assumes that liquidated damages/early termination payments are cleaner than those associated with retail load contracts as all of these products exist in the wholesale market independent of whether direct access exists or not.

David; Forster, David Subject: FW: Cities Aggregation Power Project Visit - Monday, October 1  EES is now fully stepping into the Texas wholesale market with this.  Talking to 70 municipals for aggregated power is ridiculous for EES to be doing.  This has to be stopped along with EES providing the ""Whitepaper"" products where they are providing wholesale products to San Antonio and others.  They are making Enron look stupid in not communicating what they are doing with the wholesale desk when we are constantly finding out they are talking to customers in our SIC Codes that we have been working with toward a deal.  I think a meeting needs to be setup between Lavorato and Delainey or at your level to get this fixed.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Forster, David   Sent: Friday, September 28, 2001 1:07 PM To: Kitchen, Louise Subject: FW: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes   Louise,  Attached is the original email from Dave Delainey and John Lavorato. In my opinion, utilities and municipalities do not fall within the EES target market of being ""less energy intensive and less sophisticated in their management of energy"" (see below). Neither would aggregators fall into this category.  I am also concerned about the principle of EES approaching utilities to encourage them to act as an EES sales agent. I believe this ultimately results in little more than aggregation of load into wholesale levels - and in any case, results in multiple representatives from Enron pitching products which achieve similar results from the customer's perspective.  In addition, providing EES load management solutions may jeopordize other ENA projects which require that load (services deals, plant construction, etc. in addition to the usual wholesale product suite). I am concerned about the risk (however slight) posed by the EES activity as ENA actively tries to develop relationships with these customers and to close substantial wholesale transactions.  I'll wait for your thoughts on Monday before I go to EES with these concerns.

Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.  Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact.   Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.  ENA SIC Codes:  Primary Metals Mining and Extraction  Oil and Gas Extraction Paper and Forest Products Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers Refining Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing Fertilizer Rail Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler Cement Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom Large Agricultural Processing",john.lavorato@enron.com,louise.kitchen@enron.com,FW: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes,2001-10-01 05:50:03-07:00,received

""LOWER NATURAL GAS PRICES LEAD TO ""MODERATION"" IN PRODUCTION  With the significant pull-back in natural gas prices, EOG Resources announced that it has already scaled back drilling activities during the second-half of this year and is also ""moderating"" production from existing wells, primarily in West and South Texas where it has shorter-lived wells.  Production ""moderation"" of roughly 50 MMcf/d, or about 6.0% of the company's current total North American natural gas production, commenced in September and is expected to continue through at least November.  On the drilling side, the company is currently operating 40 rigs versus a peak of 51 this past summer and expects to end the year with around 35 rigs operating.  Nonetheless, the company is maintaining its $800-900 million capital program for the full-year, although actual spending is now expected to come in toward the lower end of this range. Importantly, EOG management stated that prior to production ""moderation"" and reduced drilling, the company was on course to achieve its previously stated North American production growth target of 4.0%.  With regard to 2002, management is still optimistic that it can achieve a 4.0% production growth next year if composite spot natural gas prices average at our current forecast of $2.25/MMBtu.""  << File: gasdaily.10.04.2001.pdf >> ",john.lavorato@enron.com,mike.grigsby@enron.com,RE: Shut in comments and EOG....,2001-10-04 07:03:07-07:00,received

We are now 2 for 2 on extending our Strategic Alliances (PCOG & Suncor). Eric and his group have worked for over a year now on getting suncor extended - great job by all those involved.  Regards Rob   -----Original Message----- From:  Le Dain, Eric   Sent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 3:43 PM To: Milnthorp, Rob Cc: Oh, Grant; Keohane, Peter Subject: Suncor Inc. - Extension of Services Arrangement  Rob, Yesterday I finalized negotiations with Suncor for the extension of the Services Agreement.  Suncor/Sunoco management at the executive VP level have approved the term and general rates, and execution of a letter agreement on the extension is expected to be a formality.  We will wait for execution of the agreement nevertheless prior to booking origination.  Deal: 1. Term - 3 years - January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2004 2. Services - As per todays services to all parts of the Suncor and Sunoco business, including their retail initiative.  With respect to the retail initiative, we will only provide services to the retail company for its volumes up to 230MMCFD.  We provide services today for their current sales of 130 MMCFD.  Above 230 MMCFD we negotiate an additional rate. 3. Price: Yr 1 = $475, 000 CDN; Yr 2 = $487,000 CDN; Yr 3 = $499,000 CDN 4. Suncor gets a $70,000 CDN discount to be applied against the remainder of this year's fees,  For the three months October, November, December 2001 the total base fee is $187,500 CDN - this will be cut to $117,500 CDN. 4. Agreement - Enron Canada will prepare a letter agreement capturing the extension terms, similar to Petro-Canada. 5. Incentive Arrangement - As Suncor is putting in place a new General Mgr position to manage overall energy risks for the Suncor group, we committed to wait for this person to be in place to negotiate an appropriate incentive arrangement.  Since we have provided the most value to Suncor's consuming businesses over the years (as E&P does very little) it is appropriate to restructure the incentive to capture the value added to other parts of the business.  Enron's costs to provide the services are $168,444 CDN per year.  This cost includes all accounting and operations staff, with an allocation of rent and infrastructure.  We have five years of operating experience in providing these services and therefore are comfortable with this cost allocation.  As in the case of the Petro-Canada renewal, the allocation of Houston costs are insignificant on a per transaction basis compared to our base business.  We do not include commercial staff in the above costs as they are covered through origination deal flow.  We have made approximately $1.5 - $2.0 MM CDN each year (including this year) in deal flow from the Suncor/Sunoco alliance over the years of the relationship.  The MTM income on this transaction is $830,000 CDN or approximately $530,000 US.  I will allocate this amongst Grant Oh and myself.   While the origination is not large on this transaction, the follow-on deal flow potential, based on past experience, is significant.  Again, as with Petro-Canada, we have a marquee client renewing services for an additional term with us after a five year initial term.  This is a powerful marketing tool for the company vis a vis the quality of our services and commercial support.  This renewal is a great credit to our operations, accounting, and commercial staff.  We have had very few issues raised over the years with respect to the services provided in those areas, and have passed all audits performed by Suncor.  It also reflects very well on the hard work, and transaction/portfolio ideas of Grant Oh and Nicole LaPorte on the commercial side (and Barry Tycholiz and Jason Biever before them).   This was not an easy deal to get done, in particular the three year commitment.  You will recall that a year or so ago the odds of getting this done were probably 10%.  The key here was that we worked through and maintained relationships with up to five layers of the individual Suncor and Sunoco businesses, and we provided a very high level of service.  Peter, Would you please prepare the letter agreement this week for this transaction along the lines of the PCOG extension letter.  I'll stop by to discuss further.  Thanks.",rob.milnthorp@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,RE: Suncor Inc. - Extension of Services Arrangement,2001-10-04 10:24:15-07:00,sent

John Grass originally headed up the Wellhead desk and Outsourcing efforts for the producer segment.  I wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services.  2. When the volume of the Wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of ""contract focus"" with Ocean Energy, Andex, and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued, I asked Kevin Miller to manage Producer Outsourcing and John Grass to manage only the Wellhead desk.  3.

I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.    We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.  Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time.   Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.  Stan Horton - Global Services Louise Kitchen - Americas John Sherriff - Europe Mike McConnell - Global Markets Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets Janet Dietrich - Retail  If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.       Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Suggestion, that 1) she probably needs to rotate out of the Trading Track formally and 2) probably needs to find another home. Comments?   2. A London analyst is looking to come back to the US - has ranked well, currently in EBS.    His resume is attached... I would move to have him screened by two traders and interviewed on the 1st November along with everyone else (albeit by telephone).       3.

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.  Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.

JPMorgan Chase and Citi/SSB are doing due diligence for a short term liquidity facility.  They have specifically asked for a better understanding of the T&M business.  I suspect you have a canned presentation that you use.  That will be fine.  They are very focused on cash generation.    Trading & marketing business: a) What effect of a global slowdown on the business both short-term and long-term? b) If capital is restricted to T&M companies in general, can ENE continue to grow volumes? c) What happens to ENE's earnings & cash flow if volume growth slows / declines - is there an annuity part of the business?

" A follow up to your questions on the accounting for the above:  HPL - when Gosset began marking the position 9\30, our balance sheet gave your book the $33 Million annuity that we held as the difference between the $2.34 (original swap price with B of A) and the market price at the time of the bammel unwind.  He obviously needed this amount to keep your book whole when he began marking it.  Included in the $33 was the original $1.2      bid\offer spread.  On October 1, when Jeff pulled the total marked value off of schedule C and recognized the income, he recognized the bid\offer spread as well.  All Accounting looks clean!  Pan Nat - The day 1 booking of the arbitration changes resulted in a $18 MM loss that we booked to the office of the chair.  Since that time I am told that all of the related resid positions that you now hold are marked everyday and taken into income. Again accounting looks fine.   The only two items that remain in the ""Wes Colwell"" accrual book are the (1) mark of the Napoleonville pad gas and the related hedge (scheduled to begin the withdrawls 8\02) and (2) the hedge of the financial obligation to fill the Enron 1 cavern with financial gas.  You locked in the capital contribution for about $20 million with the hedge.  The hedge began liquidating in September and we began paying Bridgeline.  The payments take place for 4 months.

"John:  We still do not have a deal with the government.  They have delayed giving us a written proposal over the last two weeks.  The latest is that they have said that they will give us something on Tuesday of next week.  With respect to the burn rate, we are projecting about $20 million in expenditures over the next month.  Our current investment is about $220 million.  I think you should also have a rough idea of how we are funding this and what the plan is over the next couple of months.  The investment is currently funded through an off-balance sheet / on-credit vehicle with WestLB.  The WestLB vehicle is structured to fund the plant through commercial operations.  The plan is to have the OPIC financing in place to take out the WestLB vehicle.  This would infer an approximate $95 million equity investment upon the take-out of the WestLB vehicle.  We are currently in the process of syndicating the equity.  We have one indicative proposal for 50% of the equity.  We hope to have another next week.  There are some specific timing issues that you need to be aware of.  WestLB did not want to take operating risk in the financing.  Our position with WestLB is that we do not reach  commercial operations until we reach the start date of the Petrobras contract.  We are currently producing energy into the grid.  At some point, WestLB could try to force us to take out the entire vehicle prior to the OPIC funding.

"Hi John.  Here is the spreadsheet.    A couple of comments/assumptions:  Only trades done after 8/26/01 are considered (bid week started on the 27th in August). Only North American physical gas products are considered.  All numbers are in USD; an assumed conversion of 1.40 CAD/1 USD is used for the Canadian CAD trades. For index pricing, an index of 3.00 USD is used. Since on Sep 25, only the spot trades done during Aug 27-30 actually roll off, there isn't much of a rolloff on that date.  There is a much larger rolloff after Oct. 25. The first sheet has the summary data.  Each column represents the net cash we owe a particular customer as of that date.  If they owe us, the value is set to 0. The other two sheets are supporting data.  Actually, the 1st sheet is just a copy of the second one, but the spreadsheet takes so long to calc, it is easier to play around with the summary page if you remove the dependencies on the third sheet.

"John:  The following points outline the current status of the project for our discussion at 2:30 pm (Houston):  Budget:  The attached spreadsheet outlines the current status of the budget as compared to previous reports.  The basic status is that we have $4 million in unallocated contingency and are basically on budget.     Sales Process:  We have received one indicative proposal from Perez Companc to purchase 50% of the project equity in the asset company at approximately $3 million below book.  This offer is only for the asset company and does not include any transfer of the upside of the marketing company.  Total has indicated that they will give us an offer next week, but this has been delayed several times.  We are currently scheduled to complete the process with Perez Companc prior to year-end, but the schedule is aggressive.  OPIC Financing:  The main finance agreement should be complete by early next week.  We have worked with OPIC over the last few days to change certain parts of the deal structure to accelerate the process.  OPIC is now indicating more willingness to work towards a year-end closing.  The financing would represent $190 million in financing out of a total capital budget of approximately $282 million.  Construction Financing Structure:  All construction costs for the project are currently financed through an off-balance sheet / on-credit vehicle with WestLB as the lead bank in the group.  The financing vehicle contemplates the take-out of the vehicle upon the completion of construction.  The definition is in accordance with the construction contract.  Final completion of construction will not be completed until late December or early January in accordance with the construction contract due to the final completion of the water treatment facilities.  We are currently using temporary facilities to run the plant.  Enron Equity:  Under the current process, Enron would need to contribute approximately $45 million in equity in the final capital structure of the project assuming the indicative offer we have from Perez Companc.  The basic issue is the timing of the OPIC financing and equity syndication closing and the WestLB take-out.  Commercial Operations:  Upon the completion of testing of the eight unit next week, we are planning to declare the start date under the Petrobras agreement such that we can begin receiving the guaranteed payment.  The conflict created with this action is that this could create problems with WestLB under the construction financing vehicle.  The contract is clear that the take-out must occur upon completion in accordance with the construction contract which shall not have ocurred.  However, the banks have stated in the past that they did not contemplate taking operating risk.  We are working with the finance agreement to ensure that we have a coordinated strategy and story for the banks to keep them comfortable.  However, there is a risk that the banks will push for a take-out during this period.  Turbine:  We are currently evaluting the purchase of a turbine (only the engine) which is required to be on-site for operational purposes.  This is not a ninth turbine generating set as we had previously discussed.  The plan to date has been to lease this unit from GE.  However, we were presented an offer to buy a used unit with significantly better economics and operating conditions than the lease.  With our current status in the budget, we believe that we can accomplish this and still be under the original construction budget as outlined in the attached table.  We are currently expecting to receive a $6.8 million tax rebate, we have been able to defer $2.5 million in expenditures contemplated in the original budget (still included above) and we have unallocated contingency of $4 million.

After working with Joannie Williamson to coordinate open dates on your calendars with hotel availability, here is what we are proposing:  Location:   Westin La Cantera Resort, San Antonio (The Woodlands still will not have enough rooms to hold our group in February.  We are concerned that if we don't have people committed to stay over, especially on a weekend, we risk weak participation.  Also, by rebooking with the Starwood property, we hope to potentially recoup some of the loss incurred by canceling our November date and maintain a positive relationship with the company.)  Dates:   Friday, February 22 and Saturday, February 23 (We received feedback that employees may not appreciate being asked to sacrifice a weekend right now.  However, these are the dates that the hotel is available.  Available dates the previous week would interfere with Valentines Day and coincide with the peak of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.)   Agenda:   DAY 1  Friday, February 22  2pm - 5pm Registration  6pm - 9pm Reception and Chairman's Dinner   Speaker:  General Norman Schwarzkopf  (The General is currently available on this date, but has not accepted the engagement.  I feel that, if we can   reschedule him, he would be a significant draw to ensure people arrive in time for the evening activities.)  DAY 2  Saturday, February 23  8am - 2pm Business Agenda  (I will keep Ken and the brief business unit presentations/panel on the agenda.  I also hope to reschedule Gary Hamel.  Otherwise, I will  remain flexible on the agenda.)  2pm  Meeting Adjourns    No planned activities  (The activities are perceived as an unnecessary extravagance at this time.)  We'd like to issue a memo about postponing the Management Conference to invitees as soon as possible.

"PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL  I wanted to highlight my preliminary thoughts.  I suggest we get together so I can get a feel for where you want to go.  Objectives:  Primary objective is to avoid repayment of the principal Lenders prior to at least January 1, 2002.  Secondary objectives are (a) to avoid the Lenders being able to declare a default resulting in on-balance sheet treatment, and (ii) securing firm replacement financing from OPIC, but without risking the availability of the OPIC financing caused by a delay in Completion (I do not have good feel for this aspect of the matter yet, and need to pursue it with Ranabir Dutt when he returns from meeting with OPIC).  Primary Issues:  1. Under the Construction Agency Agreement (CAA) can we (ESAT) state definitively that there will not be Completion before  01/01/02? 2. Is the current running of the Project, for commissioning and testing, risking an argument that there has been Completion? 3. Can Completion be deferred without the Lenders declaring a default (Agent Event of Default) under the CAA , resulting in  balance sheet obligations?  Other Issues:  4. Can the timing of the availability of the OPIC financing be delayed to accommodate a deferral of Completion, without risking  the firmness or availability of the OPIC financing, particularly in current capital markets? 5. Are lost energy/capacity payments/revenues from deferring Completion a material commercial consideration?  The following deals only with items 1 -3.  As mentioned, I need to get a better feel for the OPIC side of things, and item 5 is a commercial matter.  Outside Payment Date:  As I understand it, the repayment obligation occurs upon the earlier of:   (a) Final Completion (as certified by ESAT) under the EPC Contract; or  (b) an Agent Event of Default; or  (c) the Maturity Date - August 31, 2002.  Alternative #1:  Deferring the activities of the EPC Contractor, including to stopping current testing operations, to ensure Completion does not occur this year.  The risk is the Lenders declaring an Agent Event of Default. This will also put some risk on the Lenders, however, for improperly declaring an Agent Event of Default for any of our resulting losses, noting:  (a)  Completion arguably means (although not entirely clear) Final Completion under the EPC Contract, requiring (i) Facility Substantial Completion (we need to confirm where we are on that); (ii) completion of the final punchlist; (iii) completion of all NEPCO clean-up and final documentation obligations; (iv) NEPCO receiving all releases and lien waivers (knowing the lien release requirements and timing are under applicable law is fundamental); and (iv) NEPCO satisfying all warranty and other obligations under the EPC Contract.  It is fundamental to determine if Final Completion is even a reality before year-end?  (b)  It is ESAT that certifies when Completion occurs.  (c)  Although there are obligations within the Scope of Authority under the CAA to take all Required Actions (Completion within the Budget and the Plans and Specifications) there is some scope or leeway for ESAT to unilaterally amend the Plans and Specifications, and thereby affect the timing for Completion, provided Completion occurs before August 31, 2001.  It may be too late    (d)  An Agent Event of Default is subject to a 10-day curing period after notice.  (e)  The Termination Payment is due within a further 10 days after notice.  Alternative #2:  Deferring the process is not necessary.  The risk is that we may be moving the Project closer to Completion in the current year and/or an interpretation that the Project is in fact Complete, noting:  (a)  The definition of Completion under the CAA does not necessarily require Final Completion or even Facility Substantial Completion under the EPC Contract.  The test is more vague, and could be to a lower standard.  Noting this difference, and understanding the mood of the Lenders is fundamental.   (b)  There is an obligation on ESAT to take the Required Actions under the CAA for Completion, as well as potential good faith obligations.        (c)  The Project is currently operating (although as noted, apparently for testing and commissioning purposes).  (b)  We may still run the risk, in any event, of the Lenders declaring an Agent Event of Default.  Other Items to Consider:  The concepts of the Start Date and Commercial Operations under the Consortium Agreement do not seem to be relevant.",john.lavorato@enron.com,peter.keohane@enron.com,Eletrobolt,2001-11-07 17:11:26-08:00,received

"To follow up our conversations, I met with the Brett Wiggs, Ranabir Dutt and others today, and have made the following clear:  1.  Brett Wiggs is to document and implement a process for completion of the project under the CAA that legitimizes that the project cannot be completed to the standard required by the required actions of the Construction Agency Agreement until the new year.  2.  Ranabir Dutt is to ensure that it is made clear in any communications with the project lenders that completion to the standard required by the CAA is not going to be achieved this year.  3.  Ranabir Dutt is to ensure that the financing from OPIC requires some completion risk or requires a standard of completion lower than what is required for the project lenders under the CAA with all other conditions to funding by OPIC to be otherwise satisfied before completion is a possibility under the CAA.  The objective is to ensure that completion and funding risk is ""hedged"" between the project lenders and OPIC, or, if OPIC flakes, to ensure that we can legitimately state to the project lenders that completion will not occur until the new year.  A couple of additional points:  1.  I told them not to worry about getting to a start date under the off-take agreement to achieve upside from capacity payments this year as it risked the project lenders being able to legitimatize completion this year without OPIC being fully committed.  2.  There is nothing preventing the project lenders from asserting that completion has occurred or declaring a default for non-payment this year.  However, I told them that we need to do the right things so that the lenders will face risk of wrongfully attempting to seek repayment if they do so.  They all seem to get the message.  I will follow up with them tomorrow.  Peter.",john.lavorato@enron.com,peter.keohane@enron.com,Eletrobolt,2001-11-09 12:01:41-08:00,received

" Kevin  Can you settle this guy down.  As well as always whining about his fake trading account, he wants to accellerate out of real time early.  Tell him to do his time and learn.  Also he wanted to go to Harry's group next which is a mistake. He needs to learn the business not the derivatives.

"  -----Original Message----- From:  Milliner, Christine   Sent: Monday, November 12, 2001 11:13 AM To: Bajwa, Bilal; Alon, Heather; Fortunov, Gallin; Rohmer, Gisselle; 'milliner@gdar.org' Subject: FW: Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call  This was forwarded to me this morning.  Someone's notes from the call.  Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.  The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.    Specific points: EES will be a part of the new company.   Enron assets will be revalued at closing.   The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.   Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%. Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.   ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.   Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.   In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.   Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.   Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'. All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks. Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure. Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.   Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs. Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there. Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.   Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing. Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing. With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash. ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.   BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies. McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks. Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA. Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model (uh-oh).  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that. Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger. Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling.  The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing. McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements. ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list. The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron. Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.   McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized. Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies. Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash. ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given). Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.' Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today. Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.  Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

" John,  A dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor.  We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's ""golden parachute"", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the ""little"" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.  I also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year.  I know the first move I suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100% commited to Enron.

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Holst, Keith   Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 8:11 AM To: Allen, Phillip K. Subject: Suggested course in uncertain times  John,  Let me begin by recognizing that you are now entrusted to resolve issues that were not of your own creation.  I also appreciate the tremendous amount of stress that you have been under especially considering the birth of your second child.  I do not envy you now, yet I am sincerely grateful that it is you and Greg leading us through these times.  The message that you have sent throughout my six years with Enron has been ""trust the system until it fails you"".  We would all be disappointed if our troubled times were a result of a few (rather large) ill-conceived investments, but the violation of trust comes from the deliberate misrepresentation of facts.  Namely the restatement of earnings and balance sheet items back to 1997.  We have all based our decisions to continue employment with Enron upon publicly available information.  Has fraudulence been proven in a court of law?  No.  However, the court of public opinion has already had it its trial, the perpetrators have been convicted and the victims now await retribution.  In this matter, the corporation is responsible to the court of public opinions jurisdiction.  I write you now to offer my version of justice.  From 1997 to date I have received restricted stock and options with a notional value of approximately $700,000 (by memory).  At the end of each compensation period, I based my decision to continue my employment with Enron on all publicly available information.  This corporation has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented these facts.  Today, I call on Enron to repurchase my entire equity portfolio and replace it with a one time lump sum payment equal to the exact notional value.  My situation is certainly unique.  I can save you the effort and inform you that my net career to date contribution is $zero.  To this I have four responses: (1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; (2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.  It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; (3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year; and (4) Despite my expectation of zero bonus I have continued to work diligently (including nights and weekends at your suggestion) at rebuilding this team.  Enron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.  You may need to make decisions on who to keep.  Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.  John, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.  I will be as patient as I can be.  Sincerely, Keith",john.lavorato@enron.com,keith.holst@enron.com,Suggested course in uncertain times,2001-11-14 06:21:30-08:00,received
"The net beneficiary of Lay's decision is Dynegy. Why wouldnt he give it to the employees vs. forfeiture??? I just dont get it.   -----Original Message----- From:  Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman   Sent: Tuesday, November 13, 2001 5:18 PM To: DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2 Subject: Change of Control Provisions   As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.  Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.  I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

I have discussed this request with them and they assure me we are not being singled out. I told them we will review the letter with credit and management and get back to them prior to the deadline imposed on their request( Nov. 20).

" Energy Cos Limit Business With Enron After 10Q -Traders By Mark Golden  11/20/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Many energy trading companies were unwilling to sell power and natural gas for next day delivery to Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday morning, a result of heightened credit concerns following the release of Enron's quarterly financial report Monday, traders and other sources said.    For weeks, companies have limited both buying and selling with Enron for future deliveries. But for the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies weren't selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month.   ""It's pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for now,"" said Charlie Sanchez, energy market manager for Gelber & Associates in Houston.    Traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn't sell to Enron Tuesday morning. Several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the situation, but declined to say so on the record.    ""Nobody will take Enron,"" one western electricity broker said. After struggling, however, that broker eventually found a utility that was willing to sell to Enron Tuesday morning.    Calpine, a prominent independent power producer and trader, said it was willing to sell power to Enron.    ""We continue to sell power to Enron and are monitoring the situation closely,"" spokeswoman Catherine Potter said.    The situation Tuesday morning was fluid. One utility that refused to sell to Enron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon, a person at the company said. That company's trading, however, was still limited to the spot markets.    Credit concerns about the once-dominant energy trading company were heightened with Enron's filing of its third quarter annual report Monday evening with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.    Enron may have to pay $690 million on a note that became a demand obligation with the company's most recent credit-rating downgrade, Enron said in Monday's filing. The company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter could be hurt by credit concerns, a decline in asset values and reduced trading activity.    ""The 10Q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns,"" Fitch analyst Ralph Pellecchia said. ""We have a lot of questions outstanding relative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how they are going to manage the situation.""    Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer.",john.lavorato@enron.com,louise.kitchen@enron.com,FW: Trading Article,2001-11-20 14:05:41-08:00,received

"Given Enron's focus on what is core vs non-core, David Hoog and I would like to spend some time with you early next week (Monday or Tuesday) to go over the unit contingent call option product (CCO) and why we believe it should be considered a core activity for Enron's power desk.  The attached summary briefly descibes this past year's activity, what has changed in the market place, and our strategy for 2002.  Our experience managing the CCO portfolio of trades this past summer confirmed we can successfully manage the price risk through the purchase of power options and swaps. The support and cooperation of the power traders and originators was also critical to our success. In addition, excess reinsurance to cover the P100 risk was available, but not as economic as using derivative hedges so we declined the cover. Excess reinsurance is a viable risk management tool and one we are currently putting in place for the 2002 season.  Let me know if meeting makes sense to you and I'll book a time for Monday or Tuesday. If those dates don't work, we'll work around your schedule.  Thanks.

"We should condition all ""free"" sleeve trades on future trades with the counterparty.   For example if Reliant does not do at least 20 trades per week with Enron, then an $0.25/Mwh charge will apply.   I simply don't believe these guys will do incremental business with us at this time so why not make some money in the sleeving process.   I can almost assure you that these counterparties are motivated to do these trades anyway.   Once they are done cleaning there books with us, they will do very limited business (only very large margin deals like the 4 yr EES supply deal and then command a huge cash collateral.).

"   -----Original Message----- From:  Belden, Tim   Sent: Thursday, December 20, 2001 3:27 PM To: Lavorato, John; Whalley, Greg Subject: Getting A Deal Done  I recognize that we are in a very fluid process right now.  However, I feel that I currently don't possess the information that I would need to make a decision about what structure and compensation would work for me and people on my team in NewCo.  I will attemp to lay out the issues that concern me and provide thoughts on what I have heard about structures so far.  Excuse me if I am off on any (or all) of my facts.  I am currently receiving mostly second-hand information from gas and power traders in Houston.  Here is the Citibank deal as I understand it: Requirement to retain between 5 and 15 employees to do the deal. Fund (at some unknown level) a retention pool to be distributed in some unknown manner to an unknown subset of the 800 NewCo people. 800 employees $30 million of 1-Day 95% VAR Total 2002 costs of approximately $300 million. Bonus pool equals 20% of EBIT Bonus paid out 75% in cash and 25% in restricted stock with a 3-year cliff vest.  Here are my concerns The cost structure appears to be well above what a $30 million VAR trading operation can support. My recollection from west power ROVAR is roughly 90% in 1998, 120% in 1999, and close to 200% in 2000 and 2001.  I'm not sure how to handicap expected future ROVAR, but without additional information from the two of you I have a hard time expecting more than 100% in a lower-priced commodity market.  Given that assumption, the $30 million one-day VAR becomes $480 million annualized VAR gives you gross margin of $480 million.  I don't know what the capital and credit charges will be, for arguments sake let's call it $30 million.  Bonus pool equals $480-$30-$300=$150*20%=$30 million of which $22.5 is cash and $7.5 equity.  I can't sign up for that math.  Please help me understand how/why my math is wrong. I need to understand our cost structure in great detail.  We need to figure out a way to allocate costs to the desk level.  If I look at West Power (everyone in Portland) assume that we have 80 people with an average of $200,000 for base salary and benefits giving us total personnel costs of $16 million.  Add on another $4 million for rent, parking, travel and entertainment ... and call it $20 million of direct expenses here.  I figure that we can make $100 million in 2002 with lower VAR and starting up later in the year.  How much of the $280 million remaining costs should I expect to be allocated to the West Power desk.  With an EBIT of $80 million times 20% I can sell.  If we have another $50 million of allocated costs then I can sell this. I recognize that the potential buyer is unlikely to fund a desk by desk EBIT.  However, I think that our goal should be to split the pie based on a desk by desk EBIT and would like to see a proforma that accomplishes that.  Proposed Retention Structure for Three People in Portland A dollar amount paid in cash over one year and equity over two years.  Price tag tbd. Create certainty around the bonus/retention payments. Indemnify against payback of deferred comp. Clarify total retention dollars for the rest of the desk. 15% of gross margin for 2002.  20% of EBIT going forward.  Other Gripes Labor has not been invited to the negotiating table. Labor doesn't get to see the pro forma. We are supposed to get paid based on EBIT yet I have no control over the expense side or the allocation side. Labor is getting accused of holding up a deal that labor had no part in negotiating. Labor is the most important driver of the value of this deal and doesn't appear to have any rights other than to accept or reject a poorly defined structure.  I want to make this thing work.  I am not trying to be greedy.  I am finding it very difficult to navigate through this process given the very limited information that I have been given.

"Shall we toss for who rings back?  Its going to be a long conversastion.   -----Original Message----- From:  Belden, Tim   Sent: Friday, January 04, 2002 11:40 AM To: Kitchen, Louise; Lavorato, John Subject: Option on Employment Contract  Like you, I am getting very frustrated with this process.  I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible.  I am not trying to ""hold up"" the deal at the last minute.  I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.  I am generally ok with the concept of the option, the doc, and comp parameters.  In addition, I need assurances that 90 day retentions will be paid to the people we have identified who deserve them and haven't received them and I need to know that the comp conveyed to me in 2001 is secure.   It is unlikely that I would be here today if it weren't for the collective comp conveyed to me during 2001.  I have received assurances from the two of you, Oxley, and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received.  The messages generally start with ""it's safe,"" ""don't worry about it,"" ""all comp paid in 2001 advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate,"" ""low probability that there will be any issues,"" ....  At other times, particularly when you want me to commit to this deal, the logic changes.  The comp paid in 2001 becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if I'm on the team.  While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days, it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do.  When I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in 2001 the answer is that it is off the table -- a non-starter.  Why?   Because the estate is negotiating the deal.  Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me. Because the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate.  I wouldn't be here but for the legacy issues with the estate -- it is definitely the buyer's issue! Because people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee.  I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estate/the buyer have time. Because we don't know who from the buyer to negotiate with.  Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues -- why not figure it out now. Because this deal is bigger than Tim Belden.  I'm not delusional.  I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts.  If it's bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me.   Since I am not ""on the team"" right now, I am also working with a great deal less information than you have.  I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people ""on the team"" versus not ""on the team.""  However, the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind.  For example, I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done, conveyed to the creditors/buyer/estate/judge works.  Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them.  If that's the case, you could add my indemnification amount (adjusted by probability of payout) to that total and it surely wouldn't blow up the deal.  Unless, the probability of payout is high.  Furthermore, I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc (subject to comment from my lawyer, but I'll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum).  I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer.  At that point in time, I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc.  Perhaps at that time, some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier.  Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent.  I don't understand why this is a non-starter issue, but I don't have the same information that you do.  To be clear, here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer: the deal as it exists plus retention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them. indemnification of 2001 comp up to $4 million.  I expect that the two of you will tell me that I'm not on the team, that 800 people are going home, and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives.  That is not what I want to happen.  If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn't happen.  I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions.  I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have.  In talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in.  I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days.  I trust that you are trying to do the right thing.  There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time.    Finally, I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier.  It's probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say.  I will call to see that you received and read this e-mail.  I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do.

"John:   I got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics.  (The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.   We  need some questions answered first to go through this:   1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.   2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.     3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?   4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?   5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?   We may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.     --Sally   ",john.lavorato@enron.com,sally.beck@enron.com,Headcount for Operations - Need Questions Answered,2002-01-12 07:23:19-08:00,received

People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.

"Dear Mr Lavorato,   I am writing you to express my dissapointment about how the whole A/A issue with UBS was handled. I have been working for a year as an Analyst in the Gas Risk Management Group. In that period I learned a lot  about risk and  trading, and eventhough sometimes we worked crazy hours, I thought I had this incredible job, and I  worked with the best people in the industry. How few of us get a chance like that?! I was looking forward to my next rotation in the origination group, when the whole Enron scandal started happening.    Even when we filed the bankruptcy, I still knew that the trading group will survive, and I was right. But I never thought that the management will so easily forget about the analysts, and not even try to negotiate analysts salaries with UBS , that all of us knew were the lowest in the market. And I am completely sure, UBS knew that too, but why would they pay us more, when our own management did not stand behind us. I remember the times when I was working till 11:00 p.m  or sometimes even longer, but since I had this incredible group of people to work with, I always thought someone would recognize that. But it looks like that it does not matter anymore how much you work, but who do you know?!   Mr. Lavorato, I wanted to share this with you because I know that you can make  a difference and that you always cared about the A/A program. Eventhough it may be late for me, it would be a great loss for the company if all  these smart people start leaving. Many of them are the brightest individuals I ever met, and I think they are the future of UBS Trading Group. I hope that you will at least think about what I said, because I know that you have a lot on your mind.    I wish you a lot of success in this year!
