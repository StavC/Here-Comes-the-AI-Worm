"Good morning all.  We apologize that we are not going to be able to have our Holiday Party before the first of the year.   We wanted to use the Scout House in West University like we did last year and it was not available.  Vince suggested that with the move and a lot of people taking vacation that we wait until after the first of the year.  This way you can take advantage  of  ""after Christmas sales""  for your gift!  Just remember whose name you have and we will schedule an ""offsite"" after the first of the year.  Thanks!

"Iain:  We went and looked at the Toshiba copier on the 32nd floor and while it does not appear to be extremely fast, I believe it will work for the 19th floor.  I spoke with Vince Kaminski and he agreed with our getting this copier.   We noticed this copier has a button that says ""Network connection"" and were wondering it this copier could be hooked up to the network and we could run copies from our computer?  Please let us know.    Thanks for all your help and have a wonderful Christmas and New Year!

Our group will assume roles centered around ""regulators,"" ""power marketers,"" the present ""investor owned utility"" and the ""town"" itself. A town meeting will be convened in which each entity is allowed to present their issues in an effort to persuade municipal decision-makers that theirs is the best option. Embedded in the exercise is the regulatory and operational framework that is built into the modules leading up to this participatory segment. Frequent references to the basic materials provided to the workshop participants will be encouraged in the process of moderating discussions that the workshop facilitators will implement. *Congestion Management Congestion management is one of the most critical components of ERCOT implementation.  A number of approaches exist for pricing electricity during periods of high demand.  Each methodology bears important consequences for both providors and customers.  Workshop participants will participate in construction of a virtual transmission grid and experiment with different methods of managing congestion. 4:00 Re-cap, Q&A  INSTRUCTORS Ms. Dottie Anderson Ms. Anderson has over 19 years experience in the energy industry with extensive experience in federal and state regulatory policy analysis and advocacy on behalf of natural gas and electric companies.

In other matters, life at Kellogg has me very busy at the moment.  I am taking a full load, including Fin Decisions and am helping Prof. Petersen write a new class called Advanced Valuation, which will be offered in the spring.  A big part of the focus of this class is going to be on real options, which is cool stuff.  And as poor as my timing is, I would like to ask you a question/favor. For purposes of this class, do you think it would be possible to obtain some of Enron's thoughts on real options?  I was thinking, for example, that a fuel-switching analysis would be neat to included in the case packet.  Of course, none of the numbers or names need be real-- only the concepts.  Well, let me know what you think of that-- who knows, Enron might actually like the free exposure.

Right now we  have five candidates, and I would imagine that a half an hour interview per  person is fine.  The interviewers will be Vince Kaminski , Ben Parsons,  myself and Steve Leppard.  My suggestion is that each candidate has three  interviews as follows:  Vince Kaminski and Anjam Ahmad Ben Parsons Steven Leppard  Depending on the number of candidates we would then interview from 3pm  through to 6.00pm or 7pm.  I will be receiving the CVs of at least two more  candidates from Huxley associates later.  One constraint is that Kirstee  Hewitt can only START interviews at 5.30pm.

She has terrible migraine headaches which are made worse by light.  We would like to get a price on having an on/off switch installed in her room.  As of now, they have removed  the light bulbs, but said that may not completely answer the problem as some one may see that they are out and request they be replaced.   I think the answer (if it is not too expensive) would be to have a switch  installed.  Please let me know.  Our Co. # is 0011 and our RC# is 100038.  Thanks!

"Dear all:  A few words about Tom.  He is a power engineer type who has previously worked  at northwestern US and New Zealand utilities on various projects including  asset planning and hydro scheduling.  He was hired by EI Structuring to  oversee modeling efforts using SDDP, Henwood, etc. Because of the recent  implosion at EI APACHE, Tom's group has effectively evaporated, and thus he  is looking for a new home. He has some  finance background  from having to  do  asset evaluation for utility rate filings.  He has almost no options  experience.  He seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of OR  problems.    Clearly the most obvious fit is with my group, but the idea is for you all to  see if Tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects.   And, as usual, the personality fit is the other aspect to examine.  This is meant to be casual. If the consensus is positive, then I will explore  the formalities of such a transfer.

Here are the details of the course (actually there are two seperate courses, one on VaR) that I promised you.  I hope to see you both again later in the month.  Best regards. Chris.     COURSE 1:   Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -  Course Leaders: Dr Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland  Houston: 29-30 March 2000 London:  3-4 April 2000  Fee : STG 1950 / USD 2950  This is an intermediate course aimed at the Energy professional who is familiar with energy derivative products but who requires the mathematical foundations of derivative pricing and an understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives.  This course assumes that participants are familiar with standard basic option pricing theory (the Black-Scholes formula, Monte Carlo simulation, and the use of binomial trees for option pricing).  The format for the course will follow our usual highly practical and successful style of alternate sessions of lectures and Excel based computer workshops. To facilitate intensive interaction, the course will be limited to a maximum of 15 participants so early booking is advisable.  The Excel based computer workshops deal with oil and gas as well as electricity derivatives and contain detailed calculations for pricing and risk management. At the end of the 2 days, participants leave with a diskette containing answers to all the workshops as well as valuable code for pricing and simulation.  Registration fee includes: pre-course reading, course materials, copies of relevant research materials, diskette with fully worked solutions to computer workshops, lunch and refreshments.  Additionally, each attendee will receive a free copy of Clewlow and Strickland's forthcoming book ""Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management"" which includes valuable contributions from Enron's Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson.  Upon registration, participants will be sent a pack containing relevant pre-course reading.

Clayton-  Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  There are a couple of things to  keep in mind:   -Enron IT supports Enron equipment.  -All equipment must be purchased through ""Enron IT Purchasing""  Our current high end desktop is a 800 MHZ pentium III machine with 128M of  RAM.  You can bump up the RAM to whatever you feel is appropriate. When the  1GHz processors come out (in the very near future) that will become our  standard.  What we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for.   The ""image"" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when  it is deployed.  If you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image  for, we can't support it for a multitude of reasons.   Hopefully this answered your questions/concerns.  If not, please call me so that we can discuss this further.

Clayton-  Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  There are a couple of things to  keep in mind:   -Enron IT supports Enron equipment.  -All equipment must be purchased through ""Enron IT Purchasing""  Our current high end desktop is a 800 MHZ pentium III machine with 128M of  RAM.  You can bump up the RAM to whatever you feel is appropriate. When the  1GHz processors come out (in the very near future) that will become our  standard.  What we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for.   The ""image"" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when  it is deployed.  If you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image  for, we can't support it for a multitude of reasons.   Hopefully this answered your questions/concerns.  If not, please call me so that we can discuss this further.

Mark-  I have developed a model for Enron that requires ultra-high-end PC  performance (it does many calculations in Excel), and my boss has authorized  me to buy whatever PC I need. I'm looking at the Compaq 850, but Richard (our  floor rep) says no PC's over the 600 series will be supported by IT. I need  to resolve this issue; we are sophisticated buyers, we know the type of  machine we want, and we have the money to pay for it.

As you are no doubt aware, THIS WEEKEND (22nd April 2000) the 0171 and 0181  London dialling codes are being replaced by 0207 and 0208 respectively.     Since our move to Enron House all external customers should have been made  aware of the new 020 7783 telephone numbers.   We are however still receiving calls on the old 0171 numbers.    Please be aware that these 0171 numbers will be cease to operate on the 22  April 2000.    From this date, calls made to the old 0171 numbers will reach an announcement  advising them to call Enron's new switchboard number: 020 7783 0000.  Please ensure that your external contacts are made aware of the correct  number convention :  020 7783 xxxx  Details of new phone and fax numbers are as follows :   Click here -->  <-- to access the Department Fax numbers details in the  ""Non-Commercial Bulletin Board"" database on ECTLON-LN2/ECT.

If you access the Enron network via 'RAS', you must ensure that the RAS  number is updated in your laptop settings.   The old RAS number was 0171 316 6666.  This has changed to 020 7783 6666.     From the 22 April 00 Oftel's 'big number' day you will no longer be able to  dial 0171 and 0181 numbers.  The new 0207 and 0208 numbers must be used in  their place.  Current users of the new code will know that at present you  must use the new area code as well as the new number.  From the 22 April 00 you will be able to dial either the local number on it's  own i.e. 7783 0000 or the area code and local number i.e. 020 7783 0000.

Rochester was formed in 1982 to focus on the executive search for senior individuals within Investment Banking and Commodity markets. The operation is based in London with a global network of associates. Business is primarily generated in Europe with an ever increasing demand from both Asia and the United States.   More specifically with respect to Enron, Rochester has been involved in the Energy markets since the opening of the International Petroleum Exchange in London. In the early 1990's, with the advent of UK deregulation, Rochester was placing electricity traders. As always, with politicians changing their minds, deregulation did not happen and market interest in Energy and Power declined.   Now that Europe is to deregulate a number of trading houses, investment banks and the utilities have expressed a strong interest in building their market presence. Subsequently we are working on a number of projects that not only require traders but also complete staffing solutions.   This includes:   1.) Board level directors  2.) Asset management  3.) Corporate finance  4.) Trading:    - Vanilla ( financial and physical ) instruments    - OTC derivatives ( Credit / Equity )    - Options    - Structured products   5.) Relationship management  6.) Management consulting  7.) Corporate lawyers    Whilst power and energy are growth areas in themselves emissions and weather derivatives are rapidly becoming a great source of interest. For your guide a former employee of Rochester is now heading up the emissions marketing group at OM here in London.   Rochester has a strong track record, and through repeat and referral business, is rapidly establishing itself as a leader in this new and exciting global market.   Should you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact us here in London. I look forward to speaking with you again and promoting an understanding of mutuality between our two organisations.

I will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won't be ringing all the time.  However, we can put them back after the summer is over.

"Shirley,   Phil Roan, the quantitative analyst from Koch's weather derivatives group  will be here on the afternoon of Friday June 16, beginning say, at 1:30 or  2:00. Vince asked me to ask you to put a set of interviews together (as I  understand, Vince himself will be unavailable that day).    Mark Tawney should see him; someone from weather marketing and/or  structuring should see him, e.g. Gary Taylor and/or Michael Nguyen; some more  people from research should grill him on technical and meteorology issues,  e.g. Vasant and/or Zimin as well as Mike Roberts or someone on his team. Phil  has only been a ""quant"" since the departure of Koch's previous weather quant  in February; before that he was Koch's weather ""risk manager"". I am still not  sure what the distinction means, but we do need to find out how much he knows  about option pricing and meteorology. Even though his expressed desire is to  focus on weather derivatives, we should also assess how useful he would be  from research group's perspective, since research will likely be his official  home.   Finally, Jere Overdyke and/or someone else from his group (George Carrick,  if available) should also get a chance to meet with him. I've already spoken  with Phil, but I'd like to sit in with either Vasant or Zimin or Mike when  they interview him, since I wasn't able to ask any technical questions.   If I'm counting correctly, that should amount to five interview sessions,  perhaps less if we interview in groups of two. Phil's resume is enclosed  below.  Joe  P.S. I will also forward this to Jason Sokolov.

A few months ago, I realized that I had reached the limit of my academic career options, at least for the near future.  After reading about careers in the private sector and discussing possibilities with some family members and friends, it became apparent that my technical and mathematical skills could be transferred to the private sector, with better long-term career options and a more dynamic workplace environment than in academic research.  The energy industry is particularly attractive as it begins to deregulate.  I have been directed to Enron by several different people as a very forward-thinking and growing company and one which values its employees.  Because of my statistical and mathematical skills, I am interested in a position as a quantitative analyst.  However, if there are other areas where the people at Enron think I could contribute, I am open to other options.  My other experience, such as project management, is outlined in my resume.  I have worked in a collaboration of 30 astrophysicists from the US, Ireland, and England and I am a capable independent worker as well.  I have excellent written and oral communication skills and have made presentations to audiences ranging from technical experts to school-aged children.  Thank you again for your time and effort in passing this resume on.  I look forward to talking with you.

Subject: Our Fourth of July  Have you ever wondered what happened to the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence?  Five signers were captured by the British as traitors, and tortured before they died.  Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned.  Two lost their sons serving in the Revolutionary Army; another had two sons captured.  Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary  War.  They signed and they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.  What kind of men were they? Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists. Eleven were merchants, nine were farmers and large plantation owners; men of means, well educated. But they signed the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penalty would be death if they were captured.  Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his ships swept from the seas by the British Navy.  He sold his home and properties to  pay his debts, and died in rags.  Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost constantly. He served in the Congress without pay, and his family was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him, and poverty was his reward.  Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery, Hall, Clymer, Walton, Gwinnett, Heyward, Rutledge, and Middleton.  At the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson Jr, noted that the British General Cornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters.  He quietly urged General George Washington to open fire. The home was destroyed, and Nelson died bankrupt.  Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed.  The enemy jailed his wife, and she died within a few months.  John Hart was driven from his wife's bedside as she was dying. Their 13 children fled for their lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid to waste. For more than a year he lived in forests and caves, returning home to  find his wife dead and his children vanished. A few weeks later he died from  exhaustion and a broken heart.  Norris and Livingston suffered similar fates.  Such were the stories and sacrifices of the American Revolution. These were not wild-eyed, rabble-rousing ruffians. They were soft-spoken men of means and education. They had security, but they valued liberty more.  Standing tall, straight, and unwavering, they pledged: ""For the support of this declaration, with firm reliance on the protection of the divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.""  They gave you and me a free and independent America.  The history books never told you a lot about what happened in the Revolutionary War.  We didn't fight just the British. We were British subjects at that time and we fought our own government!  Some of us take these liberties so much for granted, but we shouldn't.  So, take a few minutes while enjoying your 4th of July holiday and silently thank these patriots. It's not much to ask for the price they paid. Remember: freedom is never free!  Patriotism is NOT a sin, and the Fourth of July has more to it than beer, picnics, and baseball games. something to think about...

"Hello everyone:  Thanks to Krishna we have come up with a plan that I believe is going to  save everyone some time.   We have created an Excel Spreadsheet, with  the time sheet form, and there is a tab for each of you, in alphabetical  order  by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet.    The spreadsheet is saved in O:\Research\Common\SAP Timesheets\MMM-DD. (MMM = month and DD = 15th or end of the month time period - i.e., this time period is 7/16 - 7/31/00).  The regular 8 hour days have already been entered  for each of you.  Therefore, if you have no exceptions you just need to type  in  your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked (Emp Sign), and save  it.  If you do have exception time, simply open that particular pay period and  show the exception time (off-duty,vacation, overtime, sick time, jury time,  family  time, etc.) that you may have had during that pay period.  Some of the codes  have already been entered for you, the rest are listed at the bottom of the  spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever  applies.    If you are an exempt employee you need only show your off-duty time  or exception time.  If you are non-exempt you must show all hours worked  and if you have overtime, you must add that to the 8 hours regular time.   There is no code for non-exempt overtime.  This should make it much easier for everyone.  However, I will need you to fill out this timesheet form by the 13th and 29th of each month.  I will try and remind you by email the day before.  I would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation, HOD day, or any  other  off-duty that you know about before hand, that way if you are out of pocket  for any  reason and cannot fill in one of the forms,  I will be able to fill in your  timesheet for you.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.  Thanks!

The approach we've  taken to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each ENA  department's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a  vice president or director) within each group to first explain this project  and seek permission to perform the inventory, and then to ask that executive  to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The  contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's  record, and can be a manager or support staff.  There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan project.  Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic  records--much of it has never been captured. Many departments are keeping  records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable  and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what  is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be  maintained.  During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic  records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area(s) use.  The inventory itself is non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into  file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the  contact answers a few easy, simple questions.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Thank you.  Sara Bolken X35150",vince.kaminski@enron.com,shirley.crenshaw@enron.com,ENA Fileplan,2000-08-01 01:12:00-07:00,sent

Christian Werner does some really neat things on the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston for a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike  Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic?

On the Research list, Elena Chilkina is shown as an Analyst P/T, however, in the records she is shown as an ""Adm Coord"".  This was done so that she could be considered non-exempt and receive overtime.  However, her actual job is an analyst.  Also, Roman Zadarozhny is an analyst that rotated out of our group 6 months ago, but was never moved to the new group.  He is now up for rotation again and Vince said that we will just keep him until he finds a new rotation.  If you have any questions, please call me.

So if you will schedule the interview on the 14th of September, I would need to leave around 5:15 PM so I could attend  my  class.  It actually might be more convenient for me to meet with the interviewers on the 15th of September.  If this day does not fit the schedule of any of the interested in interviewing individuals, I surely will be able to meet with them on the 14th.  I will be looking forward to your reply.

(Valeria)!  0 Definitely - any of these days sound good to me.  The only concern that I have, is that I have my graduate class on Thursday night at 6 PM which is September the 14th. So if you will schedule the interview on the 14th of September, I would need to leave around 5:15 PM so I could attend  my  class.  It actually might be more convenient for me to meet with the interviewers on the 15th of September.  If this day does not fit the schedule of any of the interested in interviewing individuals, I surely will be able to meet with them on the 14th.  I will be looking forward to your reply.

Unfortunately I'll be in Milwaukee visiting Harley-Davidson about a book revision project both Thursday and Friday.  How about early next week.  I appreciate your patience with me.  When you suggested a time last week I was ""unprepared"" and embarassed to call and expose my ignorance.  Since then I have re-read the Enron Gas Services case and have a pretty good feel for how you guys have melded the physical and financial sides of the business.  The other theme that I have heard many Enron speakers use is the ""de-regulation"" of markets.  This certainly played a factor in the power business and presumeably was behind the water business.  If you'll let me know when it's convenient to call next week I'll have some notes put together.  I'm teaching a class for a colleague on Monday so anytime after that is great.

The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++ programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too.

"Hello Kenneth:  Nice talking to you this morning!  Below is your interview schedule for Monday, Oct. 30th and directions to the Enron Bldg..  Please let me know  if you need any travel arrangements made.  Coming from the northwest part of Houston, your best bet would be to  take I-45 into town.  There is quite a bit of construction downtown, so you  will probably have to take the McKinney exit from I-45 (you will need to  stay in the left lane as you approach town.  Exit McKinney to Smith Street,  take a right on Smith Street go to Andrews Street, take a right on Andrews  (the Enron bldg. is on the left), pass the Enron Bldg. cross ""Ruthvan"" (1st  stop sign) and pull into the Allen Center Parking garage (Visitors area on  your right).  Come to the security desk on the 1st floor of the Enron Bldg.  and ask for me.  They will call me and I will meet you in the elevator lobby  on the 19th floor.

A Measurement  Framework for Bank Liquidity Risk  September 15,  2000 Raymond Cote Vice President, FinRad Inc.  Raymond  Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc., a  Montreal-based  consulting firm offering financial management solutions that  combine advisory  and systems development services to &corporations and  financial  institutions.  Abstract:  Liquidity risk, as opposed to credit and  market risks, has received little  attention in professional or academic  journals. We argue that analyzing bank  liquidity risk can be viewed as a  variation of credit risk analysis. After  introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a  framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then  shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools  leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure.  The presentation then offers  concluding comments on the integration of the  liquidity risk measurement  framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

First, I'm planning on your arrival at Baylor sometime the afternoon of Monday, November 13.  I want to set up a small seminar for our faculty if you want to do it.  I will schedule it for 4 pm so if you can arrive in Waco (Continental has several flights in each day) sometime in early afternoon I'll pick you up.  The Ex MBA class begins at 6 p.m. and I'll set you up to speak first for about an hour with q&a to follow.  How about putting together some thoughts related to our paper?  You can do the same talk for the faculty in the early afternoon.  You and I can get then together on Tuesday morning to work on the paper.  I have a 1 p.m. class on Tuesday is my only constraint.  If you have time to hang around we'll do the talk a third time in that class.  By then I suspect we will have made some real progress.  Next point, we have both Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling set up for Dec 4th in the afternoon.  I plan to get some questions together for them based on our discussions next Monday and Tuesday.  I'm really looking forward to seeing you next week and to working on our paper.  Have a great week.  I'm off to Austin and New Orleans this week, thus the reason for the early message on the class a week from tomorrow.  Take care.  John  p.s.

"Hi Samer!  Hope you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving!  I found out the ""scoop"" on the ticket.  It was non-refundable and non- refundable tickets cannot be transferred.  It was just your seat that Maureen's husband used.   I will send in a check request for reimbursement in the amount of $330.50.

Things are fine over here. We are still trying to settle in; this process seems to be taking forever. I would like to ask for your help. I have received a statement from American Express related to my Enron account. The charge amount is $330.50, which is supposed to be for an airplane ticket. After calling the Travel Agency in the Park, I found out that this was the ticket that I was supposed to have used to fly to Colorado. However, the ticket was used by Maurine's husband and Maurine claimed to have paid for the ticket. Also, I remember calling the TAP and cancelling prior to the travel date. Can you help me figure out what is going on here? I am not sure who is supposed to pay for this. I disputed the charge before but my dispute was rejected. I appreciate your help.

I am curious whether your schedule  might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our  dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a national  risk management fraternity. For that matter, would you also possibly be  available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate students on  the previous day (Thursday, February 22)? What I have in mind is a  presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU  classes.   Thank you for your consideration of this request.

The week was pretty god, with perhaps some last minute tax selling on Friday. It will be interesting to see how next week fares.  I think tech will continue to suffer through the first half of the year. The earnings are not likely to improve until sometime in the second half. At that point, year to year comparisons will be more favorable. There will be some successes, as so many have been beaten down too far. Energy looks strong right now, but I would be cautious as we get past the winter and the gas price comes down to a more reasonable level.  Merrill Lynch now predicts fed cuts of 100 basis points by the end of the summer. These cuts will create a strong emotional push to the market, even in the face of lower earnings. Merrill Lynch is also predicting a GDP growth of 2.9%, down from the previous forecast of 3.3%. This certainly would qualify as a ""rough"" if not ""hard"" landing. They expect the GDP growth in the second half of 2001 to rise at a 3.5%-4% rate. They predict the strongest earnings to come from Health and Energy at about 14%, with Tech and Utilities at 10%.  Some of the market weakness and economy concern could stem from the statements being made by the new Bush administration. They want to be sure the public is aware of the slowing economy, so the issue will be seen as one they inherited, not created. They don't want to be seen as the ones who messed up the great boom. They also want justification for the tax cut plan they had proposed, and a weaker economy is certainly a good reason to stimulate the economy with cuts.  There are a number of tax law changes for 2001. The new capital gains rates for investments held over five years begins- the new rates are 8% and 18% versus 10% & 20%. The deductible interest on student loans rises from $2000 to $2500. The rate for auto business miles is rising from 32.5 cents/mile to 34.5. The expense deduction for business equipment in the first year rises from $20k to $24k. The exemption on unearned in come for children has been raised to $750, from $700. The second $750 in income is taxed at the child's rate, up from $700. So now there is $1500 of preferential taxation for kids under 14, up from $1400. For kids 14 and older, they now have $750 tax-free. On the negative side, social security taxes will be assessed on the first $80,400 of income, up from $76,200 this year.

I am currently a research Fellow with UCL conducting research, and building forecasting models for the statistical prediction of North Atlantic Sea  Surface Temperatures and other climatic parameters at long leads (1-12 months ahead of forecast period).  I have recently applied this model to the North Sea in order to aid long-lead forecasts of Fish Stocks (see SAP-symposium, 4-6 December, Bergen, Norway),  and have recently been applying similar models to the North Atlantic Oscillation,  an atmospheric phenomena which is strongly correlated with winter climate over UK/Norway and NW Europe, particularly temperatures, rainfall and windspeeds  (see enclosed poster which was presented recently at an international conference on the NAO in Vigo, Spain)  As you will see from my CV, I have 2+ years experience consulting in several areas of geoscience to the oil, gas and minerals industries and have good programming skills, both on Unix machines and on PCs.  I am particularly keen to apply my skills in the commercial sector and  initiate a permanent career path.  I look forward to the opportunity of hopefully discussing my skills further  with you in the near future.

Pavel ---------------------- Forwarded by Pavel Zadorozhny/HOU/ECT on 01/12/2001  01:37 PM ---------------------------   Dmitri Villevald <Dmitri.Villevald@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu> on 01/03/2001  06:56:54 PM To: ""Pavel Zadorozhny (E-mail)"" <pavel.zadorozhny@enron.com> cc:   Subject: asking for advice regarding Summer Associate position at Enron   Dear Mr. Zadorozhny:  Maxim Philippov suggested that I write you. Being a first-year MBA student at Owen Graduate School of Management (Vanderbilt University) with a Finance concentration, I am looking for a Summer Associate position at Enron.  The area of my particular interest is Enron's risk management products (commodity derivatives research and trading). Graduating from Novosibirsk State University with major in physics, I am eager to apply my experience with the use of theoretical and statistical physics techniques to the managing of modeling processes and creating complex financial and trading models. I strongly believe that my graduate education coupled with undergraduate background in physics, solid work experience in finance and proven entrepreneurial spirit will allow me to contribute to Enron as a Summer Associate.  I would really appreciate your advice regarding employment opportunities at Enron and would like to find out more about Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. I will call you within this week to follow up on my request.  Thank you very much for your time.  Sincerely,  Dmitri Villevald  Enclosure: resume   <<Resume.doc>> P.S. Looking through an example of margin risk hedging at Enron's Web site, I think I found a small mistake there. URL of this page is  <http://www.ect.enron.com/products/risk/margin_intro.fset.html> (producer application)  The second sentence of the paragraph beginning with ""Paradigm and Enron exchange..."" states the following.  For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then Paradigm will pay Enron $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is $2.00/MMBtu, then Enron will pay Paradigm $0.62/MMBtu.  I believe, if I am reading it correctly, the money should flow in the opposite direction, namely:  For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then Enron will pay Paradigm $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is $2.00/MMBtu, then Paradigm will pay Enron $0.62/MMBtu.  Am I right?  Again, thank you very much for your time.     - Resume.doc   ",shirley.crenshaw@enron.com,vince.kaminski@enron.com,asking for advice regarding Summer Associate position at Enron,2001-01-12 06:52:00-08:00,received

I have been looking for research papers on the measurement and causes of price volatility in electricity markets.  As a policy maker, I am interested in the implications of government policy decisions on price volatility. As an economist who has had a hand in designing the electricity markets here, I am also interested in how the design of electricity markets and the associated institutions affect price volatility.  I've found two references to a seminar talk you have given recently at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon called ""Volatility of Electricity Prices - Measurement and  Analysis of Underlying Causes."" (I've also found a multitude of references to other work that you've done, but this seemed closest to what I'm looking for.)  Was there a paper associated with your talk that I could get a copy of? Any help you can give me on finding information on this topic would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time.

Moreover,  he is a leading authority in non-linear dynamics and chaos theory and has  published a number of papers on these topics.    His talk will focus on a proposed research topic, which will provide Enron  with climatological instruments for use in the insurance and long-term  derivative markets.  The research involves a Bayesian analysis of the longest available record of hurricane activity along  the U.S. coastline.  Deliverables will address the hurricane threat in the  United States, but the methodology can be applied elsewhere.  The techniques  also can be applied to climate extremes including precipitation and temperature.  The talk is scheduled for 9 a.m. and the room assignment will be announced.

This year will be, in fact, the 20th  anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining  us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven't about the  economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a  number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and  the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a  beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from  Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check  for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the  following website URL:   http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm   Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an  after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key  research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone  and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power  markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would  be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but  knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would  not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes,  followed by a short Q&A period.   Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of  Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price  discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy  markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives  on the ""new science of risk management"" and what can be expected from it  could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event.   Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether  your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event.  Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in  discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if  this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you.

"Clifford:  In reviewing our February EIS Billing Summary for Co#0413, CC#107043, I have several questions.  Telerate: (February charges: $3,032,35) I polled the group and only one person has asked for Telerate and he is not shown being charged for it.    That is Jason Sokolov.  He would like to have access to Telerate.  If you could let me know how to get that for him.  The largest percent of the Telerate charges appear to be for Maureen Raymond, who says that she does not use Telerate.  Could she be accessing some data that she does not know is Telerate?  Please let me know.  If there are individual accounts for Telerate the only one we need is for Jason  Sokolov, unless Maureen's charges are for something that she does not know is Telerate. Tanya Tamarchenko does not need Telerate and she has the second largest percentage of the charges.  Anyway, the only Telerate subscription we need is for Jason Sokolov.  Reuters: (February charges:  $405.96) No one in Research uses Reuters.  I believe most of the charges are for  Hector  Campos who used it when he was on the trading desk.  When he rotated into the  Research group he did not need it any longer, but is still being billed for  it.  Please  remove from the Research Cost Center.  The following individuals are no longer with Enron or no longer with Research and their accounts should be removed from the Research Cost Center.  Clayton Vernon  No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL  and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center Brad Amoine  No longer with Enron   Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core  charges from the Research Cost Center Shalesh Ganjoo No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM and LIM Core  charges from the Research Cost Center  I hope this is not too confusing!

Just let me know and I will cancel billing  Jason can get access to it by submitting an e-request for him for Telerate.   When you go into E-request and it is prompting you for what application to  choose, type in the words Market Data and hit Search.  Telerate will pop up  as an option and within that choose the role Basic Energy.  We will take care  of it from there.  I will also remove Hector Campos from Reuters.  Was there anyone else being  charged for Reuters services that are not needed?  I will also remove Clayton Vernon.

"Julie:  I talked to both Maureen and Tanya and neither one want this service and have not been using it.    Maureen told me that she told you a year ago that she did not want Telerate  (when she was supporting Gary Hickerson's group on 30).  If that is the case,  we probably need a refund.  Let me know if there is anything that can be done about this.  The only person in our group that wants Telerate is Jason Sokolov and I put in a request for that yesterday.  Please cancel everything else.  Thanks!

Just let me know and I will cancel billing  Jason can get access to it by submitting an e-request for him for Telerate.  When you go into E-request and it is prompting you for what application to choose, type in the words Market Data and hit Search.  Telerate will pop up as an option and within that choose the role Basic Energy.  We will take care of it from there.  I will also remove Hector Campos from Reuters.  Was there anyone else being charged for Reuters services that are not needed?  I will also remove Clayton Vernon.  I do not see anything under the name Brad Amoine, is this the correct spelling of his name?  I will also find out where Shalesh's charges should be moved to.

He has a PHD and several years research and lab experience.    Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

"Shirley:  As requested, herein is information regarding the meeting with Vince Kaminski.   The presentation on the EGE tool's applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour.  If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday, May 29, might I request it be set for late afternoon (as my other appointments are the next day).   And, as Vince will recall, I was Co-Leader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly, and developer of the Ramp Up, Real Time, 75check and Electric Strategy tools.  Presently, I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC).     Background The U.S. power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years.  Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively.  Utilities, who still control most power plants, endeavor to adopt the entrants' methods.  Yet, inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread. Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades-old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling.  Many utilities, notwithstanding the industry-wide trend towards profit maximization, cling to ingrained routines. Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale.  A utility may operate a relatively small system (fewer than a dozen plants).  A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers, playing the wholesale market at the margin. For a variety of reasons, utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units, let alone shut down any (even temporarily or seasonally).  Economically inefficient units continue to be committed, week after week, and run in the half-load range.     EGE Objectives EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines.  Taking into account transmission and reliability factors, the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant.     I. An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or long-term wholesale power transaction with a utility; or to price wholesale power more aggressively, to take market share from the utility (i.e., compel changes in unit commitment habits).       II. An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition.       III. A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility's unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized.     Specific EGE Concepts EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities.   It produces indicative statistics such as:     a. the frequency distribution of starts per week;     b. the frequency distribution of starts by day/15-minute segment during the week;     c. the frequency distribution of load level;     d. the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start;     e. average heat rate and approximate fully-allocated cost in the half-load range;     f. average ramp rate from the half-load range;     g. the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours; and     h. forced-off maintenance outage rate (where indicated). Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month/year; in some cases, by temperature range.  (They can be by regional wholesale prices as well.)  EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years. EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data.  EGE is now updated for the 4th quarter 2000 (through December 31, 2000).  EGE 1st quarter 2000 (through March 31, 2001) will be available approximately June 15, 2001. EGE also compares and ranks generating units' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility (as well as other regional generators).  Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half-load level for lengthy time periods (without an apparent reliability basis), splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units. Other EGE supporting data:     i. planned maintenance schedule (where indicated);     j. actual maximum generating capacity;     k. actual minimum generating capacity (actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government-reported values);     l. average heat rate in the full-load range; and     m. average heat rate in the three-quarter-load range. With respect to a generating units' average heat rate in the half-load, three-quarter-load and full-load ranges, it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region.  It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities, and changes in recent years in these parameters.     The Real-World Example of Allegheny Energy Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE.  In the 4th quarter 2000, for instance, one high-cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning (52 times) and committed for the whole day (in all but two cases).  Arguably, there are power products that could substitute for this routine (in part at least) at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy. Another high-cost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn (nine times) and committed for most of the coming week.  At another plant, two high-cost units were operated too often in the expensive half-load range (some 550 hours) and three-quarter-load range (another 400 to 600 hours); they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels.  Again, there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy.     Offering of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC) EGE is a procedure, not a software package or data base.  ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities. ELC transfers its ""knowledge"" about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight-forward four-step process:     1. Enron would select one to three target utilities.     2. ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities.     3. Employing this real-world analysis as a pedagogic tool, ELC, in a one-day seminar with Enron personnel, would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future (without the assistance of ELC).     4.  Optionally, ELC would provide EGE supporting data, quarterly, to Enron. The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program (virtually all fossil fuel units).  Parameters that are incorporated, and the data set format, will be specified upon request.  Custom modifications will be considered. ......................................................................... Steven A.

The presentation on the EGE tool's applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour.  If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday, May 29, might I request it be set for late afternoon (as my other appointments are the next day).   And, as Vince will recall, I was Co-Leader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly, and developer of the Ramp Up, Real Time, 75check and Electric Strategy tools.  Presently, I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC).     Background The U.S. power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years.  Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively.  Utilities, who still control most power plants, endeavor to adopt the entrants' methods.  Yet, inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread. Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades-old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling.  Many utilities, notwithstanding the industry-wide trend towards profit maximization, cling to ingrained routines. Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale.  A utility may operate a relatively small system (fewer than a dozen plants).  A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers, playing the wholesale market at the margin. For a variety of reasons, utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units, let alone shut down any (even temporarily or seasonally).  Economically inefficient units continue to be committed, week after week, and run in the half-load range.

Let me know if either 7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.  Hope all is well.  Best, Ehud  ==============================================      Ehud I. Ronn      Jack S.

The projections are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the demand model.  Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas available in the short run. We have some good insights into this problem as well.  My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers, so our adopted agencies were selected with flood relief in mind. Each business unit is also adopting United Way Scholars students, who will participate in the Days of Caring. United Way Scholars builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.  Last year, your generosity took Enron to new heights. We raised $2.8 million, which was 21 percent higher than our original goal. In order for Enron to achieve even greater success this year, we invite you to join us in becoming a member of the prestigious Alexis de Tocqueville Society by making a pledge of $10,000 or more to United Way.    You are invited to join us at an Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. to learn more about the Society and hear about Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign plans.  The Breakfast will be held at the Center for the Retarded at 3550 West Dallas. Center for the Retarded is one of Enron's four adopted agencies for the 2001 campaign. Transportation from the Enron Building to The Center will be provided; however, if you prefer to drive yourself, we will send out directions a few days prior to the breakfast. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores at ext. 3-3908 or zulie.flores@enron.com by Thursday July 26.  Leadership giving solicitation officially begins on Monday, July 23, so look for an e-mail on Monday morning with more information about the overall campaign and how to make your pledge on-line. If you have any questions about the Alexis de Toqueville Society, or about this year's campaign, please contact Kathy Mayfield, Enron's United Way Campaign Coordinator, at 713-853-3264 or Kathy.Mayfield@enron.com.   At 49 Society members last year, Enron had the highest number of members in the city, and ranked nationally in the top 25 companies for total membership. We want to thank you for your generosity as this truly indicates how giving each of you are.   Your support is needed more than ever and is the key to surpassing our campaign goals for 2001.

As a Computational Finance student with a chemical engineering background, I am very interested in pursuing my career with Enron as this will give me the opportunity to employ the skills that I have developed during the course of my education and experience. I am currently working on an external project with Professor John O'Brien, on the Effect of Convexity on pricing Eurodollar swaps and I am confident that this experience would help me in understanding the effects of volatility on derivative prices, which is a fundamental component in the energy markets. Also, I am currently doing a project on assessing the intrinsic value of Enron and its business-operating environment to augment my knowledge of Enron in particular and the energy markets in general. My education, as well as my experiences have helped in honing my quantitative, analytical and computing skills, and have given me a significant insight into the global trading industry.  I am enclosing my resume along with this mail. As mentioned in our conversation, I would like to pursue a career in Energy trading and research.  Hoping to hear from you soon.

" Something to brighten your day!  And remember to keep in touch!   ******************************************************************************************  Jake, the rancher, went one day to fix a distant fence. The wind was cold and gusty and the clouds rolled, gray and dense.  As he pounded the last staples in and gathered tools to go, The temperature had fallen and the snow began to blow.  When he finally reached his pickup, he felt a heavy heart, From the sound of that ignition, he knew it wouldn't start.  So Jake did what most of us would do, if we'd have been there. He humbly bowed his balding head and sent aloft a prayer.  As he turned the key for the last time, he softly cursed his luck. They found him three days later, frozen stiff in that old truck.  Now Jake had been around in life, and done his share of roamin'. But when he saw Heaven, he was shocked - it looked just like Wyomin'.  Of all the saints in Heaven, his favorite was St. Peter. [Now, this line, it ain't needed but it helps with rhyme and meter.]  So they set and talked a spell or two, or maybe it was three, Nobody was keeping' score--- in Heaven time is free.  ""I've always heard,"" Jake said to Pete, ""that God will answer prayer, But one time I asked for help, and, well He just plain wasn't there.  Does God answer prayers of some, and ignores the prayers of others? That don't seem exactly square - I know all men are brothers.  Or does he randomly reply, without good rhyme or reason? Maybe, it's the time of day, the weather or the season.  Now I just ain't trying to act smart, it's just the way I feel, And I was wonderin', could you tell me - what the heck's the deal?""  Peter listened very patiently and when Jake was done, There were smiles of recognition, and he said, ""So, you're the one!  That day your truck wouldn't start, and you sent your prayer a flyin', You gave us all a real bad time, with hundreds of us a tryin',  A thousand angels rushed to check the status of your file, But you know, Jake - - - we hadn't heard from you in quite a while.  And though all prayers are answered, and God ain't got no quota, He didn't recognize your voice... and started a truck in South Dakota.  So, remember to keep in touch!    *********************************************************************************************","e-mail <.barbara@enron.com>, e-mail <.carol@enron.com>,   e-mail <.irene@enron.com>, e-mail <.jenifer@enron.com>,   e-mail <.kathy@enron.com>, e-mail <.kelly@enron.com>,   g..moore@enron.com, e-mail <.kip@enron.com>, e-mail <.lea@enron.com>,   marie.thibaut@enron.com, renee.ingram@enron.com,   rinetia.turner@enron.com, e-mail <.sue@enron.com>,   therese.candella@enron.com, e-mail <.veronica@enron.com>,   e-mail <.virginia@enron.com>, william.smith@enron.com,   j.kaminski@enron.com",shirley.crenshaw@enron.com,Cowboy Prayer,2001-11-26 12:06:17-08:00,sent

Vince   -----Original Message----- From:  Athomas80@aol.com@ENRON   Sent: Wednesday, December 12, 2001 9:53 AM To: Kaminski, Vince J Subject: Research Group Teamwork  Vince, Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the richly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created among members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to ""people"" issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse team environment.    I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and share learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron issues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with you and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be approved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed and approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, previously-published works I've done.   I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture the wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you have interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with me further in the next couple of days?

These are some things we determined through reductions in other groups that work fairly well:  have Shirley or your team admin prepared to receive all returned equipment (laptops, cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, American Express cards, long distance calling cards, etc.) have someone call Cingular to confirm that Enron accounts can be converted to personal accounts.  I believe there is a form that the employee would need to submit to Cingular prior to the termination date. Shirley should coordinate with each employee to verify that all pre-petition expenses have been paid and that all post-petition expenses have been submitted for reimbursement. Because you have some lead time, you might consider instructing employees on how they should leave their desk.  It is very helpful if employees can destroy old documents, return supplies to a central location and leave the desk clean. In the past we have realized after an employee leaves that we may not have the right contact information when needing to get in touch with them.  Attached is a template to have your employees update their personal information to ensure that any corespondance is appropriately sent.
