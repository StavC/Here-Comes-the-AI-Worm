"Shelley,  My colleague, Clayton Vernon, who has a background in  economics, wrote a  short summary of arguments against the ROFR.   We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with  a numerical estimate of the value of this option. The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has  distributional consequences: he has something  of value he never paid for. Having a numerical estimate of  the value of this option could help to argue against it. The value of such an option is case specific;  so we shall rather  produce a template you can use for valuation case by case.  Vince Kaminski   ---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 01/20/2000  08:34 AM ---------------------------   Clayton Vernon@ENRON 01/20/2000 08:29 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, zlu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: auctions with an incumbent's right of first refusal  Vince-  Here is an essay on the issue you are discussing:   The Adverse Economic Impact of ""Rights of First Refusal""  An option to ""first refuse"" to match a competitor's offer is a restraint of  free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace. This economic  conclusion is unambiguous.  If an ""incumbent"" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor, for  an item or service of value, then few competitors will invest the time and  expense necessary to prepare and submit offers, those offers will be lower  than they would have been otherwise, and the contract will often be awarded  to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger.  In a traditional auction, where all bids are sealed and the item up for  auction is awarded to the highest bidder, we can safely predict the item will  be awarded to the bidder who values it the most, at a price reflecting the  full value of the item up for auction.  This is the efficient result in a  market economy, because the financing of the high bid reflects resources  freely allocated to the high bidder.  If the auction has open bids, we can  again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder, albeit at  a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the  highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the  second-highest valuation.  Now, in a modified auction, where an incumbent bidder has the right to match  the highest bid and retain the item for himself, each competing bidder must  justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the  following, and likely, scenario: the incumbent does not spend himself for due  diligence, but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the  top bid from a competitor.  Simply put, the incumbent with a ""right of first refusal"" can be safely  predicted to simply match their competitor's bid by ""rule of thumb."" But the  incumbent's valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the  valuation of the competitor, by the amount of the due diligence and  administrative expenses.  And, the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise  of his competitors, not only in their valuations themselves, a nontrivial  financial exercise, but in any operational details required to be submitted  along with the bid.  Furthermore, in an esoteric concept known as the ""Winner's Curse,"" a bidder  realizes that if his bid actually prevails, if the incumbent fails to match  it, he almost certainly overbid.  Given this, most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when  an incumbent has the right of first refusal, and those that submit a bid do  not rationally invest the time, expense and expertise necessary; they may  just ""fire off"" a ""low-ball"" bid.  After all, in almost every conceivable  ""state of the world"" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose  money.  So, the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a  below-market price, despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest  value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its  most efficient use.

"The Gas NOPR/NOI is not on the agenda for the upcoming FERC meeting.  That's  good news from the standpoint that it gives us time to present a proposal on  pricing ROFR.

"You correctly predicted my reaction.  I think we should let sleeping dogs  lie.  Also, was it just an oversight that the FERC ignored the unsold  capacity that TW controls in evaluating how much of the available capacity  that Enron controls?  That conclusion is good for us, if it was intentional.   DF       Shelley Corman 01/24/2000 11:40 AM To: Mary Kay Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: El Paso/ENA Negotiated Rate Order  I'm sure you've seen the order approving the El Paso/ENA transaction.  For  the most part the order is a good one.  It observes that ENA holds little  capacity on TW, and that PG&E and Socal control a larger portion of capacity  on TW.   With respect to policy matters, the order is good in the sense that  it reaffirms that a pipeline can withhold capacity to maximize the value of  services if shippers are not willing to pay maximum rates.  My only concern with the order appears in the last paragraph before Section  C.  Here the Commission cautions that its will address on an expedited basis  future allegations that TW is not allocating capacity on a non-discriminatory  basis.  Certainly the Commission has always had this authority anyway.   Nonetheless, I am a little bit troubled that the Commission is addressing  Transwestern at all in an El Paso order.   TW shouldn't have to read the  orders of other pipelines for any directives that apply to it.    My knee  jerk reaction is that we would want clarification that the Commission is just  reiterating its general willingness to take up any bona fide complaints and  is not imposing any directive on TW.  But, I'm guessing you'll probably say  we should just let that sentence pass in an otherwise good order that does  not involve TW.

Also participating in the outreach  meeting will be Williams (Judy Neason/Scott Turkington); El Paso (Peggy Heeg)  and Coastal (Dan Collins).      The meeting comes at Larcamp's request and is part of a series of outreach  meetings that OMTR is having with other industry groups including producers,  gas and electric utilities and marketers.  The purpose of the meeting is not to discuss positions in the current gas  NOPR (as OMTR is assuming that the  Commission will take action on the gas NOPR in February).  The purpose of the  meeting is discuss how markets are changing and talk about upcoming  regulatory issues.  There will be no formal presentations or slides.  Lorraine will give a 5  minute overview on INGAA's themes on regulatory policy (these theme's are per  the Board of Directors' Task Force on FERC Policy):  Competition  Re-contracting challenges Rate discounting  Each of the four participating companies will have 5 minutes to relate their  pipeline experiences to these themes.  I would propose to focus my remarks on  topic of the continuous contracting state of the pipeline capacity market.   The point is to tell Larcamp that we are not looking for a regulatory answer  to this short-term, continuous contracting environment.  What we are seeking  is the rate and service flexibility we need to meet these challenges.   Examples will be the new services flexibility that we continue to seek on TW  (Enhanced Firm Backhaul, Limited Firm).  And, the pricing changes we seek on  NNG, including seasonal rates.  Again, I don't plan to have any formal  slides, but here is the outline of the message.  I would also propose to add  some specific examples/data on capacity release, recent auction experiences  and re-contracting statistics.    FYI:   El Paso plans to talk about the role that negotiated rate transactions will  increasingly play in the market place, citing their experiences in placing El  Paso capacity and their negotiated rate contract extensions on Tenn/E. Tenn.  Williams tentatively plans to talk about additional flexibility on offshore  pipelines, about the need for more self-implementing flexibility, and the  impacts of regulatory delay.   Please let me know by Monday, February 7 is you have any concerns about the  general direction of my remarks or about any other issues that you would have  me bring up with Larcamp and team.

"Gas Rule The Commission voted out a draft Gas Rule today (Rm98-10/RM98-12).  Based on  the discussion, the rule contains the following major provisions:  Waiver of Capacity Release Price Caps.  A waiver of the price cap on  short-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September  2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap. Seasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates  for short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The  Commission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a  requirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate  whether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any  overcollections would be shared 50-50 with customers. Term Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated  rates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a  Section 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates. Operational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the  lines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between  capacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation  rules, (3) moving away from ""command and control"" imbalance/OFO provisions in  favor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a  requirement to credit remaining penalty revenues. Real-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a  real-time basis. Right of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term  contracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions:  (1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates  will have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and  (2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be  required to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take  effect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct  rate for ROFR on a particular system.   Not Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction  requirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not  authorize negotiated terms.   Clarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional  Expedited Certificates The Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for  all Section 7 certificates.  During the pendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities  are in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement  may be used to rebut the presumption.  With respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally  sticks with the policy in the September order.  It reaffirms the no subsidy  policy, provides guidance on projects that are a combination  expansion/existing system, clarifies that Memphis clauses can still be used  in expansion contracts (although the FERC doesn't necessarily think its the  best way to allocate risks), and discusses ROFR in the expansion context.  It  does not appear that the clarification addresses the issue of timing of  applicability.   Keep in mind that this summary is based only on the open discussion.  A  written copy of the rule is not yet available.  I will send a more detailed  review once I have seen the rule.

"With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal,  Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that  are now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering  gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to  re-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we  should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the  right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a  customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely  that its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive  and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR,  and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers  upon expiration of the contract.    In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the  ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers  would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective  date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal  (assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an ""as amended""  basis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to  make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of  the contract.

Since you are attending in his place, I'm planning on  doing the same for you.  I'll forward a complete package tomorrow.  In the  meantime, I wanted to give you a heads up on two issues that will likely come  up at the meeting.   Pipeline safety.  There is a great deal of activity  of this issue.  The  accident in Bellingham Washington has politicians taking the opportunity to  push for tougher state oversight authority and more money to the states.   Last week a grass roots group called the National Pipeline Coalition met to  rally support for state oversight.  INGAA's general reaction has been to  distinguish gas and liquids lines and refer to the gas pipeline safety  record.  To the extent that we have distinquishing factual (not hypothetical)  date,  think this information will be useful in any substantive pipeline  safety legislation.  However, the more immediate issue is appropriations.   Jeff Keehler reports that while safety legislation is not likely this year,  he is certain that we will confront appropriations issues in the form of  higher user fees.  INGAA's approach has been to say absolutely that user fees  for gas pipelines should not be increased.  When we met with Stan Horton last  week, he felt like we should develop a compromise position on some level of  user fee increases that we could support if spent on pipeline damage  prevention (one call) and other public education efforts.  Jeff agrees that a  compromise might be a good political solution, allowing the Washington  congressional members to claim victory in bringing home more money to the  states.  Jeff plans to finish his memo on our compromise position in the next  day or so.  The next step will be convincing INGAA to look at some compromise  rather than flatly rejecting user fees.  It may be appropriate for Enron to  ask that INGAA set up a meeting of the Board level safety task force to  consider such a compromise. Electric Restructuring Legislation.  Cynthia Sanherr informs me that several  of the combined gas/electric utility members (e.g. Duke) are lobbying INGAA  to change its position on pending electric legislation in a direction that is  counter Enron's interests.  I need to get more detailed notes from Cynthia  and will include in your Board package.  She expects this to come up at the  Board meeting.

FERC should be  spending 90% of its time fixing fundamental structural rules in the electric  side and 10% refining rules on the gas side.    That is not to say that there  aren't important revisions that the FERC should take up on the gas side.   These fixes, however, can be characterized as refinements, as contrasted with  the fundamental changes we seek on the electric side.  Moreover, these  changes may largely be addressed by the recent Order 637.    With respect to E-commerce, I believe that the Enron message is that the FERC  should  fix the structural problems and get out of the way - e-commerce will  come and in most cases is already here.  Dave Forster of EnronOnLine will be making a presentation that focuses on how  much more liquid gas is than power, as evidenced by tight spreads.  In  previous presentations to FERC folks, Steve Kean has made the point that  while the rules are far from perfect on the gas side (i.e. tariffs are still  not standardized), the market works because FERC got the basic structural  rules right (i.e. 636 unbundling).   I think all your areas of improvement are appropriate (of course I don't  necessarily like them as a pipeliner), but I think they fit the overall Enron  message if presented as a list of refinements.   I plan to speak to them  about competitive pressures our pipeline face,  our current web sites, plans  for Order 637 postings and intraday capacity release.

"The whole thing also bugs me on an intuitive level, but I'm not sure it is a  legal conflict of interest.  The Northern cases he is involved in are not  really  ""GISB matters.""  There are certainly issues like the 637 compliance  issue that involve GISB standards, however.  GISB is a freestanding entitity  and his representation does not equate to representation of Enron so he could  claim that his only client interest to worry about is GISB itself.  As long  as he does not take positions in Northern cases that are inconsistent with  what GISB wants, he's technically OK.  I suspect he'd argue that his work in  the Northern docket is completely consistent with GISB's objective of  achieving world domination.  This was my from the hip analysis when Jay first  showed up in our cases, so I may have missed something.  For example, I'm not  really clear on GISB's structure.  Can we argue that it is not a real stand  alone entity but rather  a ""front"" for a cooperative group of companies that  includes Enron?  If so, we might have a real conflict.  Thanks.

The revised 2 page NDG filing states that GISB has not yet  ratified the standards. Then I noticed who signed the pleading -- Jay Costan.  I guess he ought to  know, as he is GISB general counsel!  Does anyone else find this to be a conflict of interest for him to be GISB  general counsel & then be counsel of a customer taking a position against a  pipeline in a GISB matter.  I like Jay a lot, but I'm thinking of clarifying  our understanding of his outside representation while he is GISB general  counsel.

May 31 to give them a heads-up on GPG's upcoming use of EOL.  I also hope to  meet with several of the Commissioners' assistants.  The timing of the  meeting is to ensure that we get to them prior to a press release.  The approach is decidely low key.   There is a feeling that if we make a big  deal of this with FERC, then they will ask a lot of questions about why we  aren't filing for permission.  Hopefully, if we explain that it doesn't  change any of our current practices, that its just a new computer tool, they  will chalk it up as another ecommerce story.    I hope to talk about the GPG's use of EOL generally and not get deep into the  mechanics of the specific TW auction.  The advantage of me doing the FERC  briefing is that I can talk generally and claim that I'm not privy to the  details of each of the pipelines possible EOL products.  Attached is a rough outline of my message points and a few Q&As that I have  thought of thus far.  Please send me your feedback (by noon on Tues.

"Per your request, here is my summary of the conversations that we have had to  date about complying with the new marketing affiliate requirements in  Standard L.  Frazier, Maria or Susan -- jump in if I missed something.    New Standard L Requirements  Shared Employees.  Reporting on shared employees & facilities (161.3  (l)(2)(i) and 161.3(l)(2)(ii)(c) is the easy part -- as we have no shared  employees and I think we have only minor shared facilities which are  disclosed in our standards of conduct.  Thus, we may want to tackle the  shared facilities by posting our Standards of Conduct.  Relative Position of Entities in the Organization.  With respect to 161.3(l)  (ii)(A).  Frazier has put together a idea about showing the relative position  of the pipeline and the marketing affiliates in the corporate structure.   Here's a sample of how the Northern reporting chain would look:   Enron Corp.  Enron Pipeline Holding Company   Enron Operations Corp.    Enron Pipeline Company     Northern Natural Gas   Pipeline Org. Charts, Titles, Job Descriptions (and names of supervisory  employees).  Section 161.3(l)(ii)(B) is probably the hardest part of the new  requirements.  Frazier took the task of getting with HR to pull together  initial org charts, titles and descriptions.  Since then I saw the new SAP  employee system which lists job titles & descriptions.  Perhaps HR can get  the information from there.  My ""to do"" is to get a couple samples of how the  similar employee org. chart data is presented on the electric side in OASIS.   Bambi -- I'll make sure to include you in our next discussion.

Jim Crist, a lecturer with IGT  is preparing a day-long  seminar customized to our interests and issues.     Here is my ""top 4 list"" on why GPG staff need to increase our understanding  of the electric industry.  First and foremost, gas-fired electric generation is the growth market for  gas pipelines.  We need to get a sense of why and where generation is being  built and who the likely customers are.  This involves understanding the  different between utility generation and merchant plants, the dynamics of  siting, understanding a little bit about how utilities plan and economically  justify generation investments. Second, we need to understand electric utilities as customers.  Who is the  customer these days -- the generator?  Who should we be dealing with within  the utility organization.  What types of load patterns should we expect  various types of electric players?  What types of services do they need?  We  also need to get a sense of how the timing of their processes  compare/contrast to our processes on the gas side. Third, we need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side and  the implications for electric generation demand growth.  We need to  understand the state/federal jurisdictional issues.  We need to learn about  the debates over ATC, TLR, locational marginal pricing, price caps, and  control areas.  We need to understand how these issues fit into Enron's  position in support of restructuring the electric industry, unbundling  transmission, removing native load exceptions, and avoiding prices caps and  we need to understand how these debates affect GPG.  Fourth, we need to understand electric tariffs and practices, services and  OASIS because the FERC has started to insist on common rules between gas and  electric.  The recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied on  the gas side.  FERC is talking about imposing the RTO principles on  pipelines. And, we hear a lot of comparisons between OASIS and pipeline  EBBs.  We want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practices  where it makes sense and on the flip side, know how to argue against the  imposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimate  differences between gas and electric.

Brief discussion of the basic economic differences (capital vs. O&M &  fuel) of fully depreciated (formerly utility) electric generation facilities  and the latest generation high efficiency gas turbines, and the  implications/opportunities for gas suppliers/transporters.  4.

FYI - Here is an outline of what I tentatively has lined up for Dan's visit. 10:30-11:30 Trading Floor Visit  Christi Nicolay/Kevin Presto/Steve Kean 11:30-1  Lunch (50M)   GPG Staff 1-1:30  Gas Control Tour  Mike Bryant        ",shelley.corman@enron.com,drew.fossum@enron.com,Re: Please RSVP: Lunch with Dan Larcamp of FERC on July 18,2000-07-14 01:47:00-07:00,received
"Dan also made a comment when we were chatting that the trading floor and EOL  tour was ""discouraging in a way"" because they were not yet prepared to  regulate such activities. I thought it was kind of frightening that he feels  they need to regulate such a free market, although it was not clear exactly  what he meant and I was not able to pursue it with him.

There will be no common officers between NBP Services and  Northern Plains and no shared employees.  Thus, NBP Services employees as  operator of non-jurisdictional assets will not be subject to the marketing  affiliate rules and will be free to work in a complementary work relationship  with ENA.

"I hope that you found the August 25 electric class informative and thought  provoking.  I 'm sure that in some cases the material was too basic and in  other cases the information was more than you wanted or needed.  Please send me some feedback on the class, including:  How were the speakers?  Did you enjoy Jim Crist and John Adamiak?

The company told the CPUC that  Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen  by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the  withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the  supply basins and the California border.   ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential  has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse,  collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and  merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC.   The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC  regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly  collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas  suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas  prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint  ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis  differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100  million annually since the beginning of 1998.""   Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of  $4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting,  to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the  month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September  bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in  Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to  certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month  prior, the company told the CPUC. ""No mechanism exists to recapture the  increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in  another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time.""    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --     ",drew.fossum@enron.com,shelley.corman@enron.com,Re: So Cal Edison Claims Withholding of Pipeline Capacity,2000-09-05 06:28:00-07:00,sent

"Steve,  I am most disheartened to hear that Dale Neuner regards my previous  conversation with he and Mark Taylor as the justification for why EOL cannot  accomodate  GPG pipeline capacity transactions.      During the discussion in Mark's office, Dale explained that currently all EOL  users can run reports and see all the details of transactions.  As currently  structured this would mean that any EOL user, including ENA, would be able to  run a report to see detail behind bids on pipeline capacity.  Obviously this  would be a problem under the marketing affiliate rules.  We discussed three  possible ways to address this:  Add security such that ENA/EES users cannot run reports on pipeline bid  data.  I understood leaving the meeting that this might be technically  difficult or expensive. Exclude pipeline data from the reporting feature altogether.  Here the story  was that while this was not necessarily difficult, EOL could not make any  changes before version 2 was ready.  The impression was that this would be  possible after version 2. Erect procedural firewalls.  Mark Taylor suggested that perhaps we could  inform all ENA and EES personnel that the company has a policy that prevents  them from running reports on GPG data.  This probably isn't a good long-run  solution, but we all agreed that it might serve as a bridge measure.  This  approach is supported by the fact that Enron Networks has already entered  into a confidentiality agreement with GPG.  I left the meeting thinking that one or all of these options was feasible and  have not had any correspondence to the contrary since the meeting.

"Chris Jensen, Executive Director of the Florida Energy Pipeline Association,  has learned from some DEP agency contacts that the Alliance (operating behind  the front organization known as Friends of the Aquifer, Inc.) has decided to  drop their lawsuits appealing the denials of their petitions to more severely  regulate pipelines in Florida.  While this is good news for those of us  fighting the war here in Florida, the reason for this withdrawal of their  appeals of failed efforts on three different petitions at the state level in  Florida is because of their belief that their current activity at the Federal  level holds greater promise of success and their desire to concentrate their  resources in that effort.  My thoughts on this is that the pipeline industry should get organized and  execute a ""full court press"" defense which is proactive as we move into  increased future efforts at the  Federal level by the Alliance through their  other front organizations.  These organizations have been created to burden  pipeline competition to benefit the maritime interests.  From my vantage point I am limited to mostly what I see in the press, but   these front organization are winning the battle in the national press that I  have seen and heard.  AOPL and INGAA do not come across in the press as being  equipped or prepared to handle the shaping of the pipeline safety issues in  the press that these Alliance front organizations have been doing.   Our Enron government affairs folks in Washington are knowledgeable,  experienced and capable. They have been through this battle and other battles  in the past.  So this is not a criticism, but just a friendly observation  from a remote vantage point, that if the entire pipeline industry does not  develop a proactive plan to shape the issues in the national media during the  next year, we will find it very difficult or perhaps impossible to come out  of Congress with legislation that is reasonable and workable from a safety  regulation perspective.  It has been my experience with the Alliance in the  past, that to any extent they are successful,  they will then multiply their  efforts and broaden their field of attack.  The issue is not safety of pipelines, but competition for the transportation  of energy.  We have an industry that can be very proud of it's record of  safety, economic benefits, reliability, public service, energy efficiency and  environmentally favorable service when compared to any other mode of  transporting energy.  We have learned from our experiences, research and  mistakes in the past and will continue to learn in the future so that future  pipeline service will be even better for our people whom we serve.    Our entire energy pipeline industry (natural gas and petroleum) needs to  shape the issues in the national press and tell our very good story so the  politicians are not overrun with public opinion shaped by our maritime  competition.   Thanks for your interest.  This is a ""heads-up"" that is probably not needed,  but I felt that there might be something in it that would help with a very  difficult current and future issue.

"To synthesize what I'm hearing from you and MKM (and Mr. Ni),  our story is  that we will post for sale an option with a specific MDQ, type (i.e.,  European option or American or whatever), flow period, and points.  For  example, we'd post  a European call on 10,000/d of Nov. 01--March 02 Permian  to Topock firm capacity with an exercise date of Jan 1, 2001.  the customer  would bid an option price and a transport rate.  We'd look at both components  under a publicly posted evaluation method to decide who wins.  I.e., we may  post a method saying the winner is the one who pays the highest option fee so  long as the transport rate bid is above ""x"".

"From this side, Sharon Damron's reaction doesn't fit with what I've heard  from other pipes.  For instance, Staff called one of the CMS pipes to  schedule a tech. conference on Nov. 14, but the pipe couldn't do it that day  and offered to schedule it for the 15th -- Staff answered that they would  schedule something for January in that case.

Also, in other cases Staff has given scheduling deference to meetings with  customers (settlement meetings in Dominion's case, which caused Staff to  postpone their 2nd tech. conference by 7 weeks).  -Nancy      Shelley Corman  11/03/2000 12:50 PM        To: Nancy Bagot/OTS/Enron@ENRON    cc:     Subject: Re: NN 637  FYI ---------------------- Forwarded by Shelley Corman/ET&S/Enron on 11/03/2000  12:49 PM ---------------------------          From:  Drew Fossum                           11/03/2000 10:22 AM    To: Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Mary Kay Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Glen Hass/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Dari  Dornan/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Maria Pavlou/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Shelley  Corman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Re: NN 637    Another thought on this.

"Shelley, Dale explained to Tony and I that the term ""indicative data"" should  be included.  This term is a term of art to the traders and means data which  relates to certain trading characteristics, such as how often, whether the  trades are made in groups, etc.  (Dale can give you a more detailed  explanation.)

These change= s=20 are intended to accomplish four key objectives:  First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu= l=20 business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. = =20 This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20 around a relatively small strategic asset position.  Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20 relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to= =20 directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units= =20 has become increasingly difficult.  Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions.  And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.  ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES  Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate= =20 our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20 businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20 coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to= =20 higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20 opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o= f=20 Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an= d=20 markets.  Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European= =20 (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20 operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u= nit=20 as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me= rchant=20 businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this= =20 new structure as described below.  Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum= e=20 the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20 currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office= =20 of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.  Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our= =20 international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi= p=20 positions:  Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President= =20 and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit= y=20 for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N= orth=20 America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO= =20 will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20 report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.  Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t= he=20 Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our= =20 broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region= =20 will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office = of=20 the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for= =20 Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi= ness=20 into Enron Global Assets in the near future. =20 Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined= =20 EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi= ll=20 focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20 attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to= =20 the EBS Office of the Chairman.  Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE= S=20 to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or= der=20 to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20 facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for= =20 at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout= h=20 America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to= =20 the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20 transition, Jim will join EES.  In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions:  Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=  and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20  Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20 Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20 Americas.  Enron Europe The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust= ralia=20 and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John= =20 Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.  Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and= =20 CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20 responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20 exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20 associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to= =20 Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the= =20 commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20 equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.  Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM= ahon,=20 President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.  Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b= y,=20 the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in= =20 the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more= =20 efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.  To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across= =20 EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These= =20 newly defined roles are as follows:  Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic= e=20 Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,= =20 with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20 President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat= ed=20 services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20 wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these= =20 services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will= =20 continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible= =20 for specific commodities and/or geographic locations. Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS. Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized = on a=20 regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in= =20 the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all= =20 European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin= ue=20 to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions= =20 and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi= ef=20 of Staff. Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region= al=20 basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20 Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue= =20 in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble= r=20 will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as= =20 well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=  =20 These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship= =20 to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications. Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co= ver=20 EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.  Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20 Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization= =20 continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.  ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AND ENRON WIND   As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen= ts=20 around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to= =20 EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif= f=20 Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E= nron=20 Wind, will report to Cliff.  CORPORATE STAFF   We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20 Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In= =20 that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and= =20 Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an= d=20 Chief of Staff.  COMMITTEE STRUCTURE   In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s= =20 growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20 business unit leaders.

I've got a draft of the message points you circulated on 9.28  regarding ""why gas prices have increased"" (have those changed?); I've got Ken  Lay's gas presentation before the National Governor's Conference (9.20.00);  and Gil Muhl's presentation to the AGA  in Washington D.C. on 9.19.00.

All of these applications are tightly  integrated.  We considered moving them into the ETS environment which would  separate the applications, but this would be a very large undertaking and  would be a resource intensive effort.  Therefore, due to the size, complexity  and integration of the applications, the group came to the conclusion that it  would be more timely and cost effective from an inception as well as  maintenance standpoint that ETS would have to share these systems with the  marketing group, and that porting them to the ETS environment as separate  application images would not be good from an overall migration as well as  support standpoint.  Additionally, we considered the EnPower System which is  also integrated into GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, CREDIT and UNIFY.  We are planning  on a demo Friday morning, but there may be some functionality that you all  are looking for related to gas that EnPower cannot provide at this time and  would require some customization.  We'll know more tomorrow after the demo.  Regarding security, these applications are secured to segregate the data, but  we need an approval from Legal that it would be ok to use shared resources  from the IT standpoint.  This would include application developers and  database administrators.  Additionally, we would have to go through the  process of verifying that there would be no security leaks where it would be  possible for a marketer to run a report on pipeline related data, etc...  If  we can get an ok from Legal regardinig sharing of resources, then one of  these options can be explored further, but if we cannot get approval on  sharing of resources, it doesn't look like porting either of these  applications into the ETS environment as standalone apps would be the most  timely or cost effective way to go at this time.  Can you get a stand from  Legal regarding this issue?  Thanks.   ",shelley.corman@enron.com,drew.fossum@enron.com,Risk System Alternatives Next Steps,2000-11-19 11:19:00-08:00,received
"Per our conversation at the law conference, you may want to consider how the  TW negotiated rate transactions play againt PR such as that listed below.    Nov 16,2000  California Power Plants Get Jolt As Natural-Gas Supplies Are Cut  By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal    LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their  limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp  curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity.   The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce  electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns  that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is  putting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk.   That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than  gas and generally has been costlier.   In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies  last summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to  solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now,  they're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical  problem and into a gas problem.   One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas  and electricity affect each other. ""We don't just need new generating plants  and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,"" said Terry Winter, chief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the  organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies.  ""You  can't look at these things in isolation.""   The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful of  industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns some of the  older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. But it didn't  like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when  they  burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power   plants here need to operate.   The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer.   What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and  not big power plants.   The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation,  but especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal  units to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are down about 8%  from a year ago.   ""Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,"" said  John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of  Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in the Northeast, based  on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.    High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was  $228 per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times the  price a year earlier.

"Steve,  Yes, Dan did ask my opinion on the feasibility of forming a new affiliate  company (NEWCO).  I know he asked many others as well.  Here is what I told  him:  There is no regulatory prohibition on NEWCO holding capacity on our pipelines. NEWCO will have to be set up to meet the creditworthiness standards or else  we raise the risk of having to lower the creditworthiness test for others. Under the current rules, even though NEWCO will hold capacity, NEWCO will not  be a Marketing Affiliate (i.e. requiring separate staff/systems) etc. so long  as they are not buying or selling gas.  On the flip side, if the new  affiliate sells gas Including delivered gas), the entity will be a Marketing  Affiliate and we would have to set if up so all the separation rules are  met.  I anticipate that FERC's marketing affiliate rules may change in 2001  such that any energy affiliate, including capacity managers, will be subject  to the marketing affiliate standards of conduct.  If the success of NEWCO  depends on sharing unposted information, this strategy is not likely to last  very long. Most significantly, when the new affiliate wants to resell/trade its capacity  rights, it will have to do so through the pipeline's capacity release rules.   The new affiliate can arrange pre-arranged transactions of less than 30 days,  but any other deals would have to be posted for bid.   But, I don't think we  should be scared off just because the deals would have to go through capacity  release.  NEWCO could do less than 30 day releases at above max. rates on a  prearranged basis.  NEWCO could also do 1 year of less prearranged deals at  above max rate,  they would just have to be posted to see if anyone wanted to  match the deal.   The crux is that there is no regulatory prohibition standing in the way of  setting up a new affiliate, but it is important to figure out what the new  affiliate's objective is.   If the point is to capture short-term, above max rate deals without going  through a negotiated rate posting, then we may follow a fairly simple  strategy of setting up a limited NEWCO to buy and sell capacity only.   If the point is to ""churn"" capacity trading, then the issues are essentially  the same as those involved in setting up bid/ask trading on EOL.   If the point is longer-term, total energy type of deals, then we just need to  understand that the new affiliate will be a marketing affiliate.  You ask what is being done to further this idea.   I think we need some  clearer marketing vision of how NEWCO plans to make money (through above max  rate deals in capacity release?  through rebundled deal? ) before  a more  definitive list of regulatory steps can be developed.

"Late yesterday, Steve Kean assembled a meeting of staff from across business  units to discuss the legal and regulatory implications of current events in  California.   Here are the notes I captured from the meeting.  Background: The hard cap is still in place in Calif. electric market at this time  (although the FERC has proposed moving to a soft cap under which prices above  the cap would be allowed if cost justified).  As of yesterday, electricity is  still flowing out of the state.   The governor has asked people to cut back  on their electric usage, including Christmas lights.  With rolling brown-outs  a possibility, there is a belief that people will go ahead an sell power at  high prices above the hard cap, counting on the soft cap (i.e. regulators  wanting generator to keep running at high-prices if that is what it takes to  keep going).  But, this causes an interesting dilemma under which generators  which have $5-6 gas are better off selling their gas, as only generators that  can show a $27 gas price would be able to charge market electric rates.   Parties with $5-6 gas are better off reselling the gas for another use. Delivered gas at Cal. border is $26-27 ($33.75 today) for the remainder of  the month, $19 for Jan. base load and $8 summer deliveries. It was reported that SoCal gas has been buying $24 gas to fill up storage  this week to get ready for cold weather/increased loads next week.  This  doesn't completely track with ETS understanding that SoCal was withdrawing  gas from storage this week.  Issue: ENA is  worried about two things: Whether it is prudent to sell generation at high prices counting on the  ability under the soft cap to demonstrate that costs exceed $150/MW. Whether gas will be curtailed & if so what are ENA's obligations  EES is likewise concerned about curtailments to its customers (utilities have  been curtailing, but not yet down to the core level).    If EES is curtailed  by the utility, they don't have an obligation to the industrial to keep  serving them.   But if the utility is operating under the diversion section  of its tariff to meet core customers needs, the utility can require that the  marketer keep their gas on or pay a penalty.  ENA is EES' supplier.  If EES  load is cut, ENA might face the choice of keeping the gas on and being paid a  diversion payment or paying a penalty under the utility tariff.  Action Steps: Steve formed a task force to study how curtailment/diversion/force majeure  risks play out at each chain across the gas and electric grid in California.   Once completed, he wants to undertake this analysis for the east coast,  Alberta, TX and Florida regions. Develop a PR campaign.  Steve's preference would be to get out early with a  message about what is going on in the California gas market.  In essence, he  would like to be on the offensive with a message that the problem is (1) that  utilities are gambling with ratepayer money -- not filling storage, not  entering fixed price deals; and (2) the electric price cap is also causing  strange behavior in the markets.   The ENA traders do not support this  strategy.  They prefer to lay low, arguing that the PR strategy did not work  in the California electric market.","stanley.horton@enron.com, steven.harris@enron.com, dave.neubauer@enron.com,   danny.mccarty@enron.com, julia.white@enron.com,   michael.moran@enron.com, drew.fossum@enron.com",shelley.corman@enron.com,Important: Notes from Kean Meeting on California,2000-12-06 03:31:00-08:00,sent

"Below is a copy of the Order lifting the $250/Mwh hard price cap for  California ISO/PX. FERC has also posted a notice of a  Dec. 15 special mtg. re the investigation  into the California market last summer. Various Enron units continue to receive informal data requests from FERC  staff regarding current California gas/electric  Steve Kean has asked that all inquiries be coordinated through Sarah Novosel  in the DC office. Leslie Lawner is preparing Enron's response to the SDG&E emergency petition  to put a cap on gas sales.                      COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA                              ELECTRICITY MARKETS            In response to emergency conditions that exist in the      California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages      and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission      today approved a price cap change requested by the California      Independent System Operator (ISO).   The Commission also took      steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full      capacity.            The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted.       Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the      clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase      price cap.  This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic      supply shortages.                        Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their      bids to the Commission on a weekly basis and provide certain cost      information.              The non-profit ISO and PX began operations in California in      1998.  The PX is the scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well      as other market participants.   The ISO operates and controls      most of the transmission system in California.            In addition to the $250 purchase price cap, the Commission      also authorized the ISO to penalize participating generators that      refuse to operate in response to an ISO request in an emergency.        They will be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price      the ISO paid for energy for each hour in which the participating      generator failed to respond.               The ISO's costs of obtaining energy through bids above the      purchase price cap or through out-of-market dispatches will be      assigned to scheduling coordinators who depend too much on spot      markets.            The Commission's second order enables QF entities to      generate at full capacity which in the past could have caused      them to lose QF status.  QF generators are small power producers      that use alternative fuels, such as solar or biomass, and      cogenerators that produce both electricity and steam for      commercial use.               The order on QF entities was in response to a request from a      California QF.            The orders are effective immediately.

"Enron Gov't Affairs provided this report on the Energy and Natural Resources  hearing on Natural Gas markets held this morning.  Please note the suggestion  that we provide a list of any specific items that we would like to see added  to energy policy legislation:  Witnesses from the Energy Information Administration, American Gas  Association, Natural Gas Supply Association and National Association of State  Energy Officials (NASEO) each testified that gas prices are high because  demand is greater than supply. Basically, the hearing provided an opportunity for Western State Senators to  complain about policies that restrict E&P activity - especially on federal  lands.  Sen. Murkowski will probably introduce a supply oriented bill in the  next Congress. The bottom line is that a number of Senators are deploring the lack of a  National Energy Policy and seem intent on doing something to rectify such  omission.   One specific area of interest of Senator Bingaman seemed to be the need to  create incentives to encourage pipleine investment.  He seemed especially  interested in the need for long term contracts to back development Given that there may be interest to pass Energy Policy legislation, it may be  worthwhile to put together a wish list of items that affect our bottom line,  such as accelerated depreciation provisions, tax credits, etc. ","stanley.horton@enron.com, danny.mccarty@enron.com, mary.miller@enron.com,   robert.kilmer@enron.com, ray.neppl@enron.com, drew.fossum@enron.com,   dorothy.mccoppin@enron.com, janet.place@enron.com",shelley.corman@enron.com,Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Haring on Natural  Gas markets,2000-12-12 07:27:00-08:00,sent

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.  spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.   He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".   Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of  generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This  was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

"I don't have a problem supporting the concept generally.  Since they took the  trouble to ask for our help, its probably the right thing to do politically  and relationship-wise.

She called  because she said that our pipelines are on record as saying that pipelines  need flexibility to serve electric generators.  Protests are coming from the  Dynegy/Indicate Shipper crowd that claim that pipeline can provide hourly  flexibility within current FT.   A technical conference is set for next  Tues.  & either Nancy or Jan will cover.  I told Margarite that I would see whether I could drum up any support for an  ETS intervention and comments in support.  I told her that any ETS comments  would at most be brief and state general support for the notion that pipeline  need flexibility to serve electric generators.  I also told her that I  doubted that we could file by next Tues.    Let me know what you think.  Personally I see some value from cooperating  with El Paso on this issue.  FYI - I will separately fax you a copy of the proposal to be discussed at the  next INGAA/Generator roundtable meeting next Tues. here in Houston.

"One additional point.  If we aren't going to try to rebut the ""funny money""  argument on the merits, can we at least have Leslie Lawner or someone loaded  up to dispute their circumstantial case?  Both Amoco and Dynegy argue that  marketing affiliates hold a much higher percentage of the capacity on their  sister pipelines than they do on non-affiliated pipes.  They argue that  unfairness or abuse can be inferred from that fact alone.  The Enron pipes  may be a statistical oddity on this.  A very small percentage of NN and TW  capacity has been held by affiliates.  I think the same is true on Border and  to a lesser extent on Florida.  Amoco and Dynegy can't have it both ways.  If  they want to infer abuse from a large percentage of a pipe's capacity being  held by marketing affiliates (i.e., El Paso) then they also have to infer an  absence of abuse from a small percentage (i.e., the Enron pipes).

"Shelley, I'm glad we made the decision to participate in today's drafting session.   There were only nine of us involved, with Ed Ross, Skip Simmons and Craig  Chancellor representing the generators, while Byron White, Georgia Carter and  myself were there to represent the pipelines.  The others were with the  Alliance.  Ed was his usual self.  He was confidently making the good  economic case why the pipelines should consider the generator's position and  how/why the FERC would likely side with them.  Craig tried to frame it  commercially, and Skip played peacemaker.  Byron and I played a little ""good  cop/bad cop"" on behalf of the pipes, with Byron being the bad cop.    Anyway, sum and substance, I think we'll be more pleased with the next draft  of this document than what was submitted to us recently.   The first sentence  was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of the  parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to  physical operating considerations.  There emerged a realization that maybe  two products are being contemplated here:  (1) a product that blocks out a  period of time for uniform deliveries (say, 8 hours), and (2) a product that  basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed upon  block of capacity.  It was agreed that the first product is likely to be less  valuable than the second, and priced accordingly.  Byron and I argued that  segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated, and in fact, may be  physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline.  The generators  originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the NURF rights  were carved up by hour, (ex. an 8 hr. block of 5,000/d could be repackaged as  two 8 hr. blocks of 2,500/d).  I'm not sure whether we got consensus there or  not -- we'll have to see the next draft.  The big ticket items (nos. 8, 9) got the most press.  I was troubled by the  generators' interpretation of both.  In the case of no. 8, the generators  wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a  firm service (whether FT, NNS or storage) could, pursuant to the conversion  formula, remarket their original firm service as NURF.  The generators were  looking at this provision as ""throwing a bone"" to existing customers who  might want to compete with the pipeline for NURF service using capacity (ex.  seasonal) that may not be fully utilized.  Obviously, the predetermined  conversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines, as well as the whole  notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole (ie. two or more  different product types).  We pointed out the services were all different,  and in fact, any combination of those services, conceivably, could be  repackaged under today's rules and sold as a proxy for NURF.  I believe we  were successful in taming that language down substantially.  However, be on  the lookout for the next draft.  Finally, with respect to no. 9, where the generators want receipts considered  rateable with deliveries for purposes of NURF, the generators had an  intersting slant.  Essentially, Ed was saying that he didn't want the  pipelines to hold the generators hostage on rates for NURF if the pipelines  were the only ones who could offer NURF.  By requiring the pipelines to  consider rateable receipts as meeting the NURF criteria, then Ed said the  generators would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for  ""NURF-like"" service.  Skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at  Westar in West Texas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to  a power plant located at the California border was probably unworkable.   However, he also posed the hypothet that if SoCalGas were to provide the same  storage service at the California border and those deliveries into SoCalGas  could be adjusted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant (a  sort of diversion of gas theory), then the pipeline should be operationally  indifferent to whether it was providing NURF service or a 3rd party was  providing a NURF-like service.  They just want others to have the ability to  compete with the pipeline.  Of course, the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be  the same.  Moreover, accepting such a nomination from SoCalGas could  conceivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on  (IT, LFT, etc.) as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the  pipeline's NURF service.  Skip scratched out a more tame version of no. 9,  and Ed agreed to consider it.  Be on the lookout for what they come up with.  Overall, as I said, I'm glad I was there, as well as the other pipeline  representatives.  I hope that we were successful in getting the generators  back on track here.  I'll be interested in seeing how much of our discussion  today is embodied in the next generator draft.  I told the group they were in trouble on Thursday, as we were sending in the  ""A"" team.

The bottom line is that:  1.  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities.  2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, these units are likely to be uneconomical.  3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards.  4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back-up generation at ""essential public services"" the increase in DG is expected from ""clean"" sources, not diesel emergency generators.  5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for ""clean"" sources of generation in critical areas.

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up  on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned  power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star  witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and  Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their  message was simple (and simplistic):  El Paso and Dynegy have market power. They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas  at the border (to ""obscene"" levels). That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.  Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide  the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets  any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty,  but it provides the basics.  Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to  offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California  Legislature is peddling.  Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the  California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis  when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of  the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Since I interact with my reps on a daily basis, they are the ones familiar with our business and our operational concerns. I think that it would be beneficial to us for him and other reps to attend as they would be able to provide insight to the proceedings as they pertain to our business.  We are investing time and money to attend these meetings each year.  I think we should make sure that we get the most return out of them.  Let me know if you can contact your counterpart at NNG to voice our interest?  Thanks.

Instead of the current rotation that requires 2 developers to be oncall each working day plus a third person fulfilling the responsibility on the weekend, the TMS team is experimenting with a rotation of one oncall person for work days and one for the weekend.  The TMS team will still continue to provide oncall support from 6:30A to the end of the last cycle.  The only noticeable change during this 6 week experiment will be the onsite support hours, which will now be from 6:30A to 6:00P.  Following is an outline for oncall procedure during this period:  1)  Designated TMS Oncall will provide on-site support from 6:30A to 2:00P  At times when the Oncall does not feel comfortable about being able to commute to office before 6:30A, the Oncall will  provide support from home until he/she is able to hand off the responsibility to TMS team member onsite. 2)  TMS team, collectively, will provide the on-site support from 2:00P to 6:00P  Before leaving, the Oncall person will make sure that one of the team member, already on-site, has accepted the  responsibility for answering oncall pages 3)  Designated TMS Oncall will provide off-site support from 6:00P to the end of processing for last cycle  There will be no change to the weekend oncall procedures.  John/Terry, please make sure that all schedulers are aware of the above change.  Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.

I wanted to let you know how thankful I am for the help I received from the TW scheduling group over the past couple of months as I've worked--and struggled--on the TW Daily Balancing Report. I have made repeated phone calls to Houston and have always received prompt and courteous attention from the group as I've tried to understand TMS and TW's systems and scheduling peculiarities. I have worked with Amy Mulligan, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, Christine McEvoy and Bert Hernandez.  In particular, I felt impelled to let you know that Bert Hernandez has been especially helpful in my endeavours. Bert and I spent many hours on the phone discussing TW's scheduling intricacies. He has been very patient with me and always made himself available to me to answer my questions. He was able to discuss in great detail many TW transactions, including why and how transactions appear the way they do, and what the transactional data means. He even went so far as to ask other departments for explanations as questions arose, rather than referring me to someone else, and never failed to follow-up on a question I had.  In short, I could not have made the progress I have without Bert's help.  The report is still being finalized, but Marketing and Gas Control have already employed the report with great success in managing Transwestern pipeline activities. Incremental gas sales deals were done in June and July utilizing information from the report, and the Commercial Support and Financial Accounting groups are looking at the report for ways to employ it in their work.  Again, I just wanted to pass along to you that your team was instrumental in the development of the report, and I wanted to give them the appropriate recognition. I thought I'd better send this now as opposed to waiting for PEP, lest I forget. I also believe that good news shouldn't wait. We don't always hear enough of it!  Thanks again!

Mauro Formaggio   Rick, as I mentioned to you last week, I would like you to help to organise the visit of two italian officials this summer. The first one is  - Mauro Formaggio (Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory Authority)  I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past re. UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA. He is now working on the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market, and he is asking if he could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities). Please, see this e-mail below. He has not yet decided the dates, but he is aiming at last week of August, for 1/2 days.   I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation who could help on this, and I would co-ordinate Formaggio's meeting.   Alfredo, I'm scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA. in the month of August. The aspects I'm considering are: - how OBAs are organized and how they are applied, - the operation of hubs, - the balancing penalties, - the trading of capacity - the general operation of a (big) pipeline - the general operation of a state pipeline, and of a LDC - the operation of a shipper Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your american colleagues on any of these items. --- In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader, in Atlanta (on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper, on many pipelines and storages), and to another major shipper and producer in Houston (on the relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities, as well as on the access practice). A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework. To my opinion, Northern would be all right. It should act as a model to what could also be arranged, with time, by big transmission operator(s) in our country. It could refer to the dispatching operation, and to the commercial scheduling of transmission, to the nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities. If possible, two days would be a proper duration. I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person, so there would be no need of formal presentations. The opportunity to see real operations and to discuss with experts would be all right.  In the past, when I was in Snam, I took the opportunity of keeping in touch with the developments in the Usa. So, I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system. Last time was some years ago, when I visited Transcanada, in Calgary, for a week (focusing on nomination and balancing). Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years, there were EL Paso, PG&E, Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit. Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me. As for the period, it would be in the second half of August (because with september there would be a very heavy workload to do, here in Milano). Thank you and best regards Mauro   Dear Alfredo, I'm finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte on TPA practice, there. Among of meetings I'm going to arrange, it would be of interest a visit at a major pipeline. Northern seems to me a good example. Would you envisage it as a possible example for me? I would discuss the organization of dispatching, see the nomination and balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major aspects of TPA implementation (including OBAs with interconnecting pipelines) for transmission and storage.

Suzanne,  I received the Across the World adoption package.   Most of the info that you asked for our your homestudy document checklist is also required for the dossier.  I am assuming that if I use the Across the World employment letters, income verification and medical screening forms that these will be okay for you too.  The dossier does not ask for a letter from Chad's dr. -- so I don't have a form for this one.  Is it sufficient to have a letter on the Dr's letterhead that states that he is in good health and free of communicable disease?  Also -- the dossier does not ask for a guardianship form.  Is that a Tx requirement?  Do you have a sample?       -----Original Message----- From: tina whiteman [mailto:twhiteman@austin.rr.com] Sent: Thursday, August 23, 2001 12:18 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Fw: [Kidsavefriends] Re: Took the Plunge!

"FYI - This is what came out of our ONEOK meeting this afternoon.  Please read...   -----Original Message----- From:  Fossum, Drew   Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 5:45 PM To: Neubauer, Dave Cc: Lowry, Phil; Craig, Rick; Nelson, Mike; Miller, Mary Kay; Darveaux, Mary; Davis, Britt; Ringblom, Kathy; Porter, Gregory J.; Dietz, Rick; Blair, Lynn; Stage, Michael G. Subject: OneOk Talking Points  Below are the talking points that I'd propose we run by Stan and then have Stan use with John Gibson and Dave use with Terry Spencer.  Once everyone is OK with these, I'll email to Stan and Dave with a brief explanation that our recommendation is that we politely decline the suggestion from Steve Winston that we voluntarily rewrite the measurement agreement.    1.  Steve Winston's suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's Scott City measurement agreement with Kinder Morgan.  It uses PTR as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  That structure is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agreement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers from Northern's ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK's PTR numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a ""BTU measurement error"".  2.  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEOK's PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AGA quality specifications.  ONEOK's independent outside experts, Barnes and Click, confirmed this fact during the arbitration.   3.  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine whether to call a ""special test"" of the accuracy of Northern's ultrasonic meters pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  Upon calling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters.  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.  4.  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to track the structure of the Scott City procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurement and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specifications.  5.  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, based on Northern's meters.  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plant, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  Since ONEOK has not called a special test of Northern's meters, the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months.  If ONEOK does not agree to that reconciliation, Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.

" I want to thank each of you for the role you played in maintaining operations and customer communications during the Internet outages we have experienced this week.     Having knowledgeable and dedicated staff to answer customer calls is always important, especially during periods of Internet and email outages.  Our customer teams and the HotTap helpdesk talked many customers through the process of using the offsite server and even manually entered nominations for customers.  Our gas control staff continued to effectively operate our systems despite having to handle an increased volume of calls from customers and while working in an environment without many of the normal reports.  The events of last week and this week added to an already long list of operational and systems challenges that we have faced this summer.  It has been a long and exhausting summer for our entire ETS logistics team and for our system support staff.  And, with a move ahead for much of our team, I realize that there are still added demands on everyone's plate.  As I salute all your efforts to date and your patience in the move ahead, I need to make a few additional requests of you:  1.  Please refrain from any non-essential Internet use.   As our team is connected back to Internet access, it is absolutely critical that we not re-infect company computers.  Please avoid use of any non-essential business sites, including news, shopping, financial, games, etc, whether at your desk or dialed in to company computers through VPN.  If you have a question about the appropriateness of a site, please consult with a team advisor.   Some groups may be disabled from Internet access altogether for the immediate term to ensure the reliability of critical systems.  This is a serious issue for Enron.  If our team re-infects company computers it will impact the long-term ability of our group to have Internet access.  2. Make sure that customer calls are answered.  The demands of system outages, testing and moving are weighing heavy on all of us.   I know that you have gone to great lengths to answer customer calls these last few days.  I need for you to continue that level of customer phone service.  Each customer team needs to ensure that customer calls are answered by a live representative and do not roll to phone mail.  This is the level of service that we have committed to deliver to our customers and we will have to find a way to keep this promise despite our move and other demands.  3. Smile and know that you are appreciated.  It seems like everywhere we turn these last few weeks we are confronted with bad news -- national events, Internet viruses, the stock market.   Perhaps it is trivial, but I wanted to make sure to tell you how much I appreciate what you do.  I feel proud to be part of this team and even prouder of the way that we pull together during tough times.  I also wanted to tell you that we are planning a fun celebration for our team in the near future -- details to follow soon.

"Catherine,  Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would be emailing you.     This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.    We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.  We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.  Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.

" A couple of thoughts on the SoCalGas Complaint  1.  Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake -- not a billing mistake.  The point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlement and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.  The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.    2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).  3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.  FERC let them re-bill customers for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.  I think this is a 2000 case.","maria.pavlou@enron.com, j..porter@enron.com",shelley.corman@enron.com,SoCalGas Complaint,2001-09-26 15:04:12-07:00,sent

I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans.   I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together for court dates/travel.  One of the other Houston families (Swangos) has made progress on their dossier and turned in their INS approval.  The other (the Westbrooks) haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier.  I want to be very supportive and accomodate all the families -- after all the goal line is home for all these children.  At the same time, I need to form realistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family.  I think talking to Liz will be helpful on this front.   Thanks for all your help.

To facilitate and manage the collection of personal contact data, a new field has been added to eHRonline. Beginning Monday, October 1, all ETS employees will be prompted to either ACCEPT or DECLINE publication of personal data (i.e., home phone number) when first entering the eHRonline system. All ETS employees should access the eHRonline system at their first opportunity to respond to this new request.  While certain positions within ETS mandate disclosure of personal contact data (i.e., home phone number) for emergency response purposes, in other cases disclosure of this information is at the discretion of the employees. If you are an ETS Operations employee and do not want your home phone number published, please contact your Director prior to electing not to publish your personal contact information.   To access eHRonline, go to the ETS HRWeb link: https://ehronline.enron.com/ and select eHRonline. Employees must enter their SAP Personnel Number and Password to enter the system.

" Pam,  Thanks for all your help on the move/relocation.  I think you, Donna Scott & Jean McFarland have made the process of moving very efficient for all involved.    On the longer range issue; however, I need to elevate my level of concern that the moves are having on customer service issues.  Since Tropical Storm Allison, ETS has experienced one computer system outage after another; including the virus problem the week before last.  This morning our scheduling system is out and we are having Internet problems -- both of which are impacting customer nominations.  During system outages it is imperative that gas logistics be able to mobilize and implement back-up plans to ensure customer transactions.  This is best handled by having a central staging area.  I realize these system reliablity problems have nothing to do with our moves or with the ultimate location of the Gas Logistics group.  Certainly I am pursuing these reliability concerns with Steve Hotte.  But, in light of these issues, I would like to talk about the timing & end state of where Gas Logistics is to be located and how long it is going to take to make this happen.   I know that your first priority of late has been to get us off 41.  Now that that has happened, I'd like to talk about the timing for which floor remodeling comes next (39, 42, etc) and the ramifications for my group.

Due to ""scheduling conflicts,"" Wagner pushed back the deadline for president ALJ Jacob Leventhal to issue a decision to Oct. 30 from Oct. 15.

" Liz,  I'm not sure if we met either time at the Austin airport this summer.  My husband and I hosted 4-year old Alina, part of the same Taraz group as your child.   We miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home.  We're certainly not looking forward to travel at this time, and even less happy about leaving our 6-year old son home while we are out of country, but we are resolved to bring Alina home -- the sooner, the better.  Based on conversations with Ginger and Chris, it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time -- although I'm not sure when.  We have completed our dossier (although I haven't sent the originals to Ginger); completed our home study & sent into INS recently; and we've already done the INS fingerprinting.  So I guess the next steps are INS approval, shipping stuff off to Kazakstan, and getting our Kazakstan visas.  One of the hardest parts of the Kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return.  She is in the Ulan orphanage in Taraz.  Alina speaks only Kazak, no Russian, so I'm not sure how I'd communicate with her long distance even if I had an address or phone number.  Fortunately I have received periodic emails from Larissa, the escort that came to Houston with the children this summer.  Her husband, Sergei, has been to visit the children in Taraz & she sent me a picture of Alina.  Sorry to ramble so.  I'm anxious to talk to you about your child, your travel plans, possibilities for hiring an escort, etc.  Please feel free to call or email me anytime.  Here is my contact info.

Subject: TW Negotiated Rates  (Message from Greg Porter)    PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION  This afternoon we plan to send to Indicated Shippers (IS), Staff, CPUC, Southern California Edison (SCE) and Sempra (are there others?) the conceptual framework for settlement of the disputed proceeding in Docket No. RP97-288 et. al (""framework"").  This is the same framework that has already been provided to Staff (prior to the September 30 Oral Argument) and IS (last Thursday, October 4, 2001).  In addition to the framework, we will provide the specific tariff language to implement the process changes contemplated in the framework.  Since we are scheduled to give Judge Leventhal a settlement status report tomorrow, it seems best to proceed with distribution of the specific tariff language to all parties at this time.    The specific changes set forth in the tariff sheets (e.g., separation of capacity allocation procedures from ROFR, removal of certain discretion) seem to be the easy items for TW to include in a settlement.  They are relatively ""painless"" offers that are easy for us to agree to.  Although these items may go a long way towards settlement, they likely will not be sufficient to get such parties as the IS  and CPUC fully on board.  Accordingly, we need to all give thought to other items that we could offer down the road to achieve a unanimous settlement.  We need to be creative.  A couple concepts that have been advanced internally so far are:  Max. rate cap moratorium for operational capacity (adavantage: may provide CPUC  enough until they pursue their larger industry policy objective). EBB sytem that allows a shipper interested in capacity to simply enter a receipt and delivery point; the system will automatically let the interested shipper know how much, if any, capacity is available (advantage: although it doesn't provide the IS's the ""last look"" auction their looking for, it at least provides an open process for anybody that is interested to find out if capacity is available (eliminates any claim of ""tortious process""); disadvantage: feasibility and cost are unknown at this time). Other suggestions?  We need to consider all ideas that will address in part the:  1.  IS's desire to have all capacity bids posted and subject to review and further bidding; and  2.  CPUC's perception that negotiated deals above max rates are not in the consumers interest.  We may ultimately not be able to get a settlement, however, we should weigh the cost and benefits of doing so.  At this point we need to consider possible items that could be offered in settlement.  We will not offer anything additional until we find out more specifically the parties reaction to the framework and TW's specific tariff changes.  We won't know where we are until we get this important feedback.  Nonetheless, especially in light of the short time schedule, we should give specific trade-offs consideration now.    Please let me know what thoughts or feedback you have.    Thanks.

Well, I can't believe another year has passed, but it has.  Sunday, October 28th  is the Juvenile Diabetes Walk for a Cure! Again this year, I'm recruiting walkers for my team or simply asking for your support.  I know you hate to hear those pleading calls for more of your money, but I'm going to ask anyway - most of you know me well!  You see I have to.  As an insulin dependent diabetic myself, it is my obligation to do what I can to support every effort to find a cure for this disease which affects so many adults and children!  I know many of you see me deal with this disease everyday as I face it each time I put food in my mouth.  I follow my meals religiously with a shot of insulin along with several finger sticks a day to check my blood sugar.  It was only 4 years ago that I was diagnosed with diabetes, but your dollars are making a difference.  Within 2 years, they are expecting to be able to release insulin that can be inhaled which would eliminate the painful injections.    I know that you have been inundated with organizations seeking your support to fund their projects and this has been especially true this year, but I hope that you will consider JDF one of the few that you continue to support as I do.  Please consider joining my team or one of the many other Enron teams and help us find a cure for Diabetes!  An Enron JDF t-shirt will be given to each walker or sponsor who contributes $25.00 or more!  If $25.00 isn't in your budget, you can purchase a ""JDF Shoe"" for only $5.00 and it will be posted at the Big E Caf? on October 26th.  As always, your contributions are matched by Enron!

"Kent,  I can get together on Tues.  at 1:30.  I certainly want to make this report as useful as possible.  But, in some regards I feel like I failed my group in not memorializing the notes from our Omaha meeting on the specific changes that we agreed as a group to make to the report.  I have kept Dale in a state of fiddling with this report for two months now.   For example, my notes from our meeting reflect the fact that we decided against trend information.  I am certainly willing to change that decision if you guys collectively agree.  Have you considered whether we need different types of reports rather than try to accomplish all on this page.  The purpose of the current page is for gas logistics to report on what is happening on the system (i.e. how the physical world is tracking to the paper world).   We need to run through this exercise from a gas logistics side each day even if it isn't meaningful to marketing.  I'm not adverse to the concept of studying shifts in gas flows from day-day or year-year, but perhaps this is a distinct analytical tool.  Hopefully we can work out these details on Tues & then run with it.      -----Original Message----- From:  Miller, Kent   Sent: Thursday, October 11, 2001 10:34 AM To: Corman, Shelley Cc: Williams, Jo; Neubauer, Dave Subject: RE: Meeting  Shelley,  The changes are an improvement.  Both Jo and I were thinking that we were moving toward having a summary section where the system-wide balance was addressed.  This would include things such as a summary receipt/delivery balance, how gas is moving across the system at key pipeline points, how much capacity (such as at Clifton) that is used for transport vs. contract storage vs. operational storage (line pack changes).  Also, we were looking for some longer term trend information such as what were the zones in the Market Area and other key points were using last year so we can see the year-on-year trends.  We find ourselves talking about specific volumes at specific points and we feel that it would add a broader feel as to what is happening on the system if we can start with a broader look at the entire system and then move into more of a location by location/point information.  These were some of the things that we wanted to sit down and talk about to be sure that were all on the same page.  Could we plan on getting together after Lynn's brown-bag lunch presentation (about 1:30)?

" Here is my two cents...  From your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches  overhang the condominium fence.  If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.    The condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on our property or destroy the tree.    A landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is obstructing a public road.   A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.  Since the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a ""negligence"" issue. Further, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm  unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.    If the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a ""nuisance"" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.  Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.  Bottom Line:  We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down.           -----Original Message----- From: Chris.Sanguinetti@stpaul.com [mailto:Chris.Sanguinetti@stpaul.com] Sent: Tuesday, October 09, 2001 4:05 PM To: ashfordumc@aumc.org; scorman@enron.com; e_turney@hotmail.com Subject: Cutting Trees & Brush along our fence    Greetings:  I spoke with Connie of Hunter's Point condominiums who asked that if they could cut the trees and bushes along the fence line we share. She said its on our property and thought that we should cut it since it is on our property and blocking the view of the residents of the complex.  Advised her that it is currentl y not a problem for us and if Hunter's Point trim the trees and bushes they must clean up any cutting and not leave them on our property. Connie advised she would check with their landscape company and advise.  Shelley, can you advise if we are required by any law to trim the trees and bushes which block the view of an adjoining resident, I guess for good neighbor policy and as we are a church we could do our civic duty, this also raises the question, if we are blocking their view now, what happens when we build the new Sanctuary and they have a problem with our roof blocking their view?

Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's email.

She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.

This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.    We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.  We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.  Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.

"Dear Shelley,   What an exciting story!  I am sure that you are anxiously awaiting being reunited with Alina.  I know that the bureaucracy for an international adoption can be quite extensive.  We had some good friends who adopted a little girl from an orphanage here in Almaty and they worked really hard to be able to do so.  I hope that the procedure will come to a closure soon so that you can come to bring her home with you!     I was, indeed, able to travel back to Kazakhstan last month without any significant problems.  I was on the first BA flight Houston-London after the attacks, so the lines were huge, but there was no problem with the flights themselves or with security.  It just took more airport time.     In Kazakhstan, the situation is currently peaceful.  The government here seems concerned with protecting its borders and American interests.  We are in contact with the American embassy here, and have made contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates, but we feel fine about remaining here at this time.

I'd rather that there were no tolerances in the OBA -- only the concept of reasonable balances.   With this point located in the makret area, it is quite possible that we'll be the ones with the swing (especially since we'll have flow control).    If you prefer a tolerance in  both the termination and tolerance paragraphs I guess that's fine -- since the only remedy in either case is termination of the OBA.  The existing balance (even if over 100,000 cum) will be settled up under the OBA.    -----Original Message----- From:  McCoppin, Dorothy   Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 2:22 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: FW: Gulfstream OBA-Final Look Importance: High   Shelley --     Frazier did not seem to understand my changes in the tolerance sections (4c and 4d).    So, to clarify:   On the tolerances, my concern was twofold -- that we only have the 100,000 dth limit in   the ""termination"" paragraph (and not in the tolerance paragraph), and that it was not clear   that, even if the cumulative daily imbalances totaled only 5% of the scheduled volumes for   the month, the parties would work to keep it below an actual volume of 100,000 dth (or have   a right to terminate the agreement if it were over that amount).   --Dot  -----Original Message----- From:  McCoppin, Dorothy   Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 11:34 AM To: Farrell, Sharon; King Jr., Frazier Cc: Corman, Shelley; Hayes, Robert; Kilmer III, Robert; Boatman, Jack; Bryant, Mike Subject: RE: Gulfstream OBA-Final Look   Here are my comments.

Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's email.  Hope all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school.  At first he expected to be  coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month. Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.  I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what Chad needs to develop.  While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look like Alina and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.

We stayed in a hotel during our stay in our son's adoption city and  then had an apartment during our stay in Almaty.  We personally loved  having an apartment - it was ""our time"" with our son - we were able  to start being a family and doing family things - playing, cooking,  cleaning, etc.  Our life began together immediately - I think (and I  don't know, since we didn't do this) if you were with a host family -  it would put a different twist on the situation.  Not saying good or  bad - just different.  Kind of like when you visit someone and stay at  their house vs renting a hotel room.  You can be more ""open"" when you  are with your own family.  Best wishes on your adoption journey. :)  Cyndi    ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________  Message: 7    Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2001 09:22:22 -0400    From: bbrierefamily@juno.com Subject: Re: Re: HIV Testing and Russia  I find all of this very interesting.

We stayed with a family in a small apartment adjacent to their own apartment.  It was a wonderful way to get our new son used to family life as well as have Russian speakers nearby to ease the transition to living with English-only speakers.  The particular family we stayed with consisted of a grandmother (retired schoolteacher) who was there ALL the time.  Babushka cooked all our meals as well and she and I became close friends even though she spoke only Russian and I only English.  The father was an engineer by training but was currently doing much of the document running necessary for the adoptions processed by our facilitator.  The mother was an ear/nose/throat doctor and there were 2 children (17 year old boy who spoke wonderful English and acted as our translator - for a fee of course - and his 10 year old sister).     I would encourage anyone who has the option of staying with a family to do so.  It helps to see how families live over there as well as observe first hand how food is served.  They eat the same sorts of food we see all the time here but serve it differently.  That knowledge alone was wonderful to have when our son first came back.  I fixed the food in the manner he was accustomed to seeing it served.  He now eats the way we do (big plates and cooked in our way) and he's been back since 1 March this year.

The tantrums just crack me up because of their similarities.  Of course, that's cuz we havent had one here in a week.  But, it is so typical for our kids to be ""set off"" by something that seems so simple, and then they end up hating themselves (I call it a ""hate fest"") and being self abusive.  Karly has told me during her tantrums that she is going to run away or kill herself, and she hits herself too.  How Kaz of her....yet her therapist says she's processing everything well and doesn't need to be seen every week.  But, it still is a worry for the future.....     Here's a question.  If the kids are tantrumming and abusing themselves, doesn't that show guilt and self hatred?  Even though Kira doesn't feel bad about drinking the soda, doesn't she feel bad for doing a wrong thing?  Is the problem that she doesn't feel bad for hurting and disappointing the family?  Is this just misplaced guilt?  Here is an idea (and it is just an idea) about the conscience thing. The current behavioral theory with ""normal"" children is to discipline and consequence inappropriate behaviors without expressing anger, so kids don't feel shame or guilt.  So, would a way of teaching guilt include the parent sharing feelings of sadness and disappointment at the behavior?For instance, when Kira is calmed down, or at a later time, can you share your sadness that she lied to you?Can you on a regular basis model different feelings (it is totally hard for me NOT to model anger and frustration).  Just an idea.    What do the professionals who you all are working say about conscience?        Shannon, just once in a while, Karly has a positive feeling about her first family (such as when her birth parent bought her koolaid-wow there's a real  great parent, huh).  Anyway, I point at that it's good that at least she has ONE good memory about her, but when she begins sentimentalizing (?!) she is reminded that the nice kool aid lady also left her alone for hours, beat her, screamed at her and cut her with a knife.  This way, I figure she has a balanced perspective....  See you all later,  Denise     [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]    ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________  Message: 11    Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2001 18:50:33 -0000    From: dazzle@gte.net Subject: Re: HIV Testing and Russia  --- In pakk@y..., bbrierefamily@j... wrote: > we needed the HIV only if we would be there more than 3 months.    > Debbie  I have been trying to check out the requirements for Russian Visa's  and Kazakhstan Visa's with several of the agencies that assist people  in getting their visa's.

He turned 8 in May 2001, and  is JUST starting school in Kazakhstan.  When he comes home, I'd like  to get him into second grade after a few months of english at home,  home-bonding and home-schooling.

We adopted our son, now 3 from Taraz in August of 2000 using Kids First/Frank  Foundation.    In answer to alot of your questions, We flew through New Yorks JFK to Moscow,  that flight was 10 hours long and we arrived in Moscow in mid morning and  were brought to a hotel close to the airport to eat and rest.  Our flight to  Almaty left at 11pm.  We arrived in Almaty after a 3 hour time difference and  I believe the flight was about 3 hours as well, so it was about 4am Almaty  time.  Once we got our luggage and made it through customs to our  coordinator, the sun was just coming up.  We then went to her flat to rest  some more and eat breakfast.  (Although it seems like we had alot of time to  rest, it was worth it to lay down as much as possible and relax to help us  adjust to the time change)  We then went to the bank to get money that had  been wired to us and then got our tickets for the train ride for that night.   I believe we got to the train station about 5pm for the train to leave about  6pm.  We had our own cabin that had 2 padded benches with clean linens,  plenty of pillows, a table and a window.  We were able to store our luggage  under the bences.  The door to our cabin locked from the inside and we felt  completely safe the entire time.  We took alot of video footage of the towns  we went through.  There were people that would try to sell stuff at each of  the stops.  Everything from bottled water to fried chicken.  The bathrooms  were not the greatest on the train, but when you have to go, you take what  you can get, although they were better than any port-a-potty I have ever been  into here in the states.  Although I didn't visit other areas on the train,  one of the people we were traveling with did and said you will see all sorts  of people that are in non-private cars, but nobody ever bothered us.  We arrived at the Taraz train station around 4am and were met by the driver  of the orphanage with his van.  We were brought to our host families flat to  get settled and then went to the orphanage to meet our son.  Each day we were  able to visit the bobek for about 3 hours in the morning and 2-3 hours in the  afternoon.  Our court experience was short and non-eventful.  We were able to  have dinner with the orphanage director at a restraunt by her flat.  We were  able to go to the store everyday for bottled,noncarbonated water (and beer  too)  We also visited the internet cafe which is just down the street from  the telecom building.  It was very inexpensive.  We ate at a few restraunts  in Taraz as well and never got sick.  One gentleman got sick from drinking  some bad vodka, but said it was just like he drank something that didn't  agree with him, he vomited once and was fine.   The train ride back to Almaty left about the same time and we had no worries  with our son.  We made a bed for him on the floor between our benches and he  slept the entire time.  Another couple I know, made a bed for their infant in  their small suitcase ontop of their clean clothes so the child wouldn't roll  around.  One thing I can't express enough was the CHILDRENS CHEWABLE DRAMAMINE!  It is  perfect and the last thing you want is a vomiting toddler on the plane.  It  is messy and awful.  Also take lots of pictures!  While putting together my sons scrapbook of our  journey to get him, I realized I hadn't taken pictures of things that now are  important.  If you have any questions, feel free to email me.  God Bless and good luck.

Initially, I felt strongly that we should change their birthdates by  1 year -- but Jackson felt VERY strongly that we should not.  His  logic was that after we opted to change their Russian and Kazak  names -- the only ""thing"" they brought with them from Kaz was their  birthdates.  The school district initially placed a GREAT deal of pressure on us  to place them with their age peers, but we resisted and basically  demanded that they be placed back 1 year -- which was within our  rights to do -- although the school district tried to convince us  otherwise.  They kept telling us that ESL would catch the kids up  soon enough -- but given the fact that neither child had much formal  education, we didn't feel starting them in 2nd and 4th grade was in  their best interest.  So, although our kids were 8 and 10 years old when they came home in  April of 2000, we started them off in 1st and 3rd grade.  The kids  then attended 1st and 3rd grade summer school -- and we moved them on  to 2nd and 4th grade in September 2000, just over 4 months after they  came home.    Academically and socially, they were really still about a year behind  their classmates, maybe more, when they started 2nd and 4th grade  last year -- but by the end of the school year they were almost  working at grade level and were nearly on par socially with their  classmates.  In terms of their sizes, which was a MAJOR driver behind holding them  back 1 year -- I would say they were about in the middle of their  classes in terms of their heights and weights when they started  school.  HOWEVER, after being home for 16 months -- BOTH kids were at  the 60th percentile for height for their AGES -- making them two of  the tallest kids in their grades.  I don't have the exact figures on how much they grew -- but we know  that in the first 18 months after Nicholas left the orphanage he grew  more than 7 inches and Kira grew more than 6 inches and gained 11  pounds the first year home.  We did initially consider holding them back 2 years from their age  peers when they came home -- but we are VERY, VERY glad now that we  didn't do that.  If we had held them back 2 grades instead of just  one BOTH kids would have TOWERED over the other kids right now.   Academically they would have been better off, but socially it would  have been disasterous.  As it is now, the kids look noticeably bigger  than many of their classmates -- which is incredible given how small  they were compared to most of the other kids when they came home.  Anyway, this is what we did....

This is something that I have also considered for the child that I intend to  adopt, in order to put her on a more even level with her ""peers"" here. She just  turned 6, but is about the size of a 3 1/2 year old.  As far as I know, she has not gotten any formal schooling yet where she is,  even though she would be in Kindergarten or 1st grade here by now. I want her  to have every advantage to get the most out of her experiences in life, and  feel that she will be best served by allowing her to be the ""same age"" as other  children that are closer to her size and developmental level.      ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________  Message: 19    Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2001 20:33:45 -0400    From: ""The Kesslers"" <THE.KESSLERS@prodigy.net> Subject: Re: Taraz  We have been home from Taraz for 6 months now, and I have traveled there twice.

It is reprinted here.  My name is Vanessa and I am in the process of adopting from Kazakhstan. I live in Connecticut. I have completed the home study process but am waiting for one more piece of paperwork to come back, that will make it official. I've also started the INS process. My homestudy agency is the Adoption Resource Center of Connecticut and I plan to work with World Child on the actual adoption. I have already been in touch with them. I am hoping to adopt two children as an older single parent (no more than 1 boy). I would like the children to be between 1 and 5 or 6 years old, and, if possible, siblings. I would like any information that I can get on the process for the next stage of it, any information from people who have 'been there' and I would love to network with people who will be doing this as well. Many thanks and I look forward to 'meeting' all of you.  Vanessa   __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Make a great connection at Yahoo!

Nicholas was at about the 25th percentile for height (given his bio  age) when we brought him home -- but is now -- less than 18 months  after coming home -- at about the 60th percentile for height.  When  we brought him home he looked to be about 7 or 8 years old -- but now  looks every bit his 11 years old.  Kira was about the size of a typical American 4 year old when we  first met her in November/December '99, although she was 8 years  old.  She barely wore a size 6 when we brought her home in April 2000  and looked by then to be about 5 or 6 years old.  Now, less than 18  months later -- she looks like any other 9 year old -- and looks  noticeably older than many of her classmates -- some of whom are  almost 2 years younger than she is now.  We NEVER would have believed how much the kids would grow and change  in such a short time -- and I'm sure it's hard for other parents to  imagine, as well.  However, I also know what we experienced doesn't  happen in every case and that many kids remain small or about the  same size as their younger classmates.  Knowing what will happen in  any individual case is pretty much guesswork...but you should think  about how you will handle a situation in which your child is  significantly older than his or her classmates -- but does not have  the academic strenght to skip a grade later on.     ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________  Message: 22    Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2001 22:01:03 -0400    From: ""McCarthy"" <LynnMcCarthy1@mediaone.net> Subject: Birth date adjustments  Just our two cents worth about changing/not changing birthdates.  We chose NOT to adjust our son's age because he was already showing signs of being on the tall side - even for a Kazak.  Liam was 8 (birthday is 17 Oct) when I brought him home on 1 March this year.  Within a couple of weeks of coming home, he was placed into a first grade in an Arlington, VA public school with ESL classes for 2 1/2 hours every morning.  This provided 2 things for him:  (1) he was placed with an age group that matched his social development plus (2) he was still getting ESL.  We found Liam was reluctant to mix with any neighborhood children until he started school and socialized with American kids.  Since we have relocated to the Jacksonville, FL area, Liam has entered second grade in Clay County.  Here the ESOL classes are total immersion so that he is in with children from a variety of cultural backgrounds but they are allowed to only speak English in the classroom.  He is also taken for special work with the Title 1 teacher as are some of the other children who lag behind in reading, English and/or math.  We've noticed considerable growth in Liam over the last seven months in terms of height and maturity.  If he catches up academically, we may consider skipping a grade.  However, we don't make much of a deal over the year or two difference between he and some of his classmates.  He is, by the way, not the only one his age in his class.  Guess we feel, as Laura said earlier, that his birthdate was really the one thing that was all his from Kaz and it is as much a part of his identity as his brown eyes and warm smile.

A parent's wanting to be understanding of their child's sensitivity to his/her social/academic/physical lag compared to his/her age-level American counterparts seems laudable, but I agree that this recourse should probably not be entered into lightly.  I had a 14 year old in my classroom this summer who came from Russia when he was 10.  Aside from a bit of lingering awkwardness with some aspects of writing, their was remarkably nothing socially to separate him from his classmates (and in math he was very proficient).  On top of this, he was from a household where the parents spoke almost entirely Russian around the house!     ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________  Message: 24    Date: Wed, 17 Oct 2001 02:44:23 -0000    From: adopt101@aol.com Subject: Re: birth dates  >>Could someone please clarify what is meant by ""changing"" their  child's age?  Since their true age is part of their adoption records  and visa(s), I assume that you just mean to let them believe they are  a different age.<<  Some parents legally change their child's age at the time of adoption  in Kazakhstan.  From what I understand this is ""technically""  impossible to do in Kaz and Russia -- but I do know of parents who  did this during the overseas adoption process -- usually to make  their child 1 - 2 years younger.  In other cases, parents either tell their child they are a year  younger than they actually are -- and the kids believe this -- while  in other cases parents discuss it with the child and agree to  consider the child a year or two younger.  Parents in many states also have the option to legally change their  child's age at the time of readoption, and sometimes can even  petition a judge outside of a readoption.  Standards vary by state  and sometimes by jurisdiction as to if/how parents can do this -- so  it's best to talk with adoptive families in your community if you are  considering legally changing your child's age.  For example, I know  parents who simply petitioned the court without any  supporting ""documentation"" as to why the child should be made younger  who successfully changed their kids ages -- while other parents had  to submit dental, medical and psychological records supporting the  position that the child was ""younger"" than his or her stated age.  >>Yet it will be clear to the child immediately, if not soon, that  they are engaged in some sort of deception (no harshness intended),  won't it?

Many of these kids have no idea how old they are --  and some ""think"" they are one age but are actually another (usually  older) age.  It depends on what the practice is in the orphanage --  some recognize birthdays and group kids by age -- while others do  little, if anything, to recognize birthdays or segregate the kids  according to age groups.  Our kids knew how old they were, and the  season their birthday was in...but I suspect that was ONLY because  they were each in foster care and celebrated a birthday with their  foster families just before their adoptions.    ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________    Your use of Yahoo!

"  -----Original Message----- From: Hess, Theresa  Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 10:26 AM To: Corman, Shelley; Holmes, Bradley Subject: FW: Press Release -- NERC Expands Role   FYI -- NERC is expanding their role to include development of wholesale electric business practice standards, in addition to reliability standards.  It looks like they're making it clear that they don't want an EISB developing wholesale electric standards.  They plan to be the single organization for developing these standards.  They've even added balanced voting for their committees.  I don't know the details, but they're using pieces of GISB's process that they know work and that people like.  Some GISB representatives have been making it look as if everyone in the energy industry is on board with EISB.  Clearly, they're not.  I'll let you know if I hear anything else.  Theresa   October 16, 2001  NERC Expands Role  At a watershed meeting today in Vancouver, BC, the North American Electric Reliability Council's (NERC) Board of Trustees took bold steps to expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric industry in North America.  Michehl R. Gent, NERC President and CEO, said, ""On the strength of strong recommendations from the NERC Stakeholders Committee, the Board pledged to take all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards and to file such standards with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and appropriate government agencies in Canada.""  ""NERC is committed,"" says Gent, ""to establishing a fair, open, balanced, and inclusive process for developing all standards.""  NERC's Board approved a new process for developing standards and agreed to a new composition and weighted sector voting model for its standing committees.  NERC has long been recognized and respected as the industry's developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission systems throughout North America.  These standards have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems for over 30 years.  Richard Drouin, Chairman of NERC, stated, ""The Board of Trustees recognizes the urgent need for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated.  Such standards,"" Drouin added, ""are vital to support the evolution of competitive electricity markets, the formation of large regional transmission organizations, and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission systems.""  Today's actions are a major step toward formalizing a role that NERC has filled for some time.  NERC spearheaded the OASIS ""What"" and ""How"" Working Groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed by all transmission providers; formed a Market Interface Committee to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability; and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative, which recently filed a report with FERC on its efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling (OASIS Phase II).  To accomplish its reinvention, NERC will actively solicit support from Canadian and U.S. government entities, and facilitate ? jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state, and provincial regulators; and other stakeholder organizations ? an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the details of its new role.  In parallel actions, the Board also took steps to ensure the independence of actions by its 21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of its standing committees.  For more information on NERC or its transformation into NAERO, visit NERC's web site (http://www.nerc.com/). The web site also includes information on the electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and activities.   *********************   NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems that serve North America. It works with all segments of the electric industry as well as customers to ""keep the lights on"" by developing and encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these systems. NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada, and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

I did notice that MARITAL was spelled marial in the marital  section.  I'm sure your spellcheck probably caught it.I noticed that you mentioned  the"" Republic of Kazakhstan"" quite a few times. I'm not sure if that is  the  correct name of the country. I will check and let you know if you need to  change it.There is only one other thing that needs to be changed .It is  located about the last paragraph of recommendation where you state that  ""the  family is excited to experience the Russian culture"".That statement would  be  very offensive to the Kazakhstan officials if you were to mention Russian  culture. These people are not part of Russia-they are Kazakhstani- and a  very proud people.So you could just change the word Russian to Kazakhstan.  They do not like to be referred to as Russian.Let me know if you have any  questions. I left you a message to call me but I don't think you need to  call back unless you have questions. Please make sure that there is a  current agency license at the back of the homestudy when the family sends  their homestudy to me.

I.             All correspondence and communications with regard to this filing should be directed to:   Shelley A. Corman Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Relations  Enron Transportation Services Company 1400 Smith Street, P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX  77251-1188 Phone:  713-853-7083 Email:  shelley.corman@enron.com   Nancy E. Bagot Enron Transportation Services Company Manager, Government Affairs Washington, DC  20006 Phone:  202-466-9148 Email:  nancy.bagot@enron.com   II. MOTION TO INTERVENE The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines. 2.      Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  In some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases Enron is a part owner.  These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines. The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party.  Thus, the Enron Interstate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest. III. COMMENTS             The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein.             Like INGAA, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition.  First, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.  Second, the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates.                Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights.               For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment, the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition.

Among the proposals are new or revised standards for capacity releases and recalls which include support for intraday capacity releases and would remove current GISB restrictions against partial-day recalls.    Our fundamental concern with the proposed standards is that they do not fully address the far-reaching impact of flowing day recalls.  There are significant operational concerns with these standards.  We are concerned about whether the operational provisions are in place to ensure that the recalled party does not continue to flow, particularly during critical periods.  We are concerned about whether current GISB communication time frames are adequate for handling the ripple effect of flowing day recalls across the grid.   The proposed standards address only one narrow operational concern - whether gas has been scheduled on the particular contract to be recalled.  This does not begin to address the operational challenges of the recall or the potential impact to other transactions across the grid.     Given these operational concerns, we do not understand the rush to adopt flowing day recall standards.  While we understand that this work is in response to R00026, we do not believe that flowing day recalls are necessary to fulfill the scheduling equality requirements of Order No. 637.   Order No. 637 requires that replacement shippers have the same nomination opportunities as shippers acquiring original capacity.  There are no existing pipeline contracting or scheduling functions that are the equivalent of the recall of capacity by a releasing shipper. Very few pipelines have received authorization to sell hourly services and most pipeline tariffs prescribe a uniform hourly flow rate throughout the day.   Further, most pipelines have not yet received approval to implement balancing provisions to address daily price fluctuations or intraday variability.    In the spirit of compromise, we have worked on and concurred with revised standards that permit intraday releases.  However, under these revised standards, all capacity release options continue to be available only on Business Days to insure that the proper contractual relationships and notice provisions are supported.  Nonetheless, throughout the negotiations on this compromise approach, the pipelines have made it clear we cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards.     Aside from our opposition to the flowing day recall standards, the pipelines have agreed to other recall standards that are more liberal than are supported by the existing standards.  In this area, we have agreed to support a revised standard which will permit capacity to be recalled for transactions in the Evening Nomination Cycle.  This allows a releasing shipper to recall capacity until the afternoon of the day prior to gas flow.  While this timeline supports a shorter notice for recalls, it still preserves the application of the full-day contract entitlement and gas flow rights for both the releasing and the replacement shippers.  Flowing day recalls, though, are a separate issue.  Flowing day recalls could significantly increase the incidence of scheduling problems, overruns, imbalances and increased occurrences of Operational Flow Orders.  Because of the potentially disruptive nature of flowing day recalls, pipelines cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards.    Any move from daily increments of service to partial-day increments of service must be undertaken in the context of all services offered on each pipeline system, including firm services, interruptible services, and balancing and operational provisions. Because these developments involve changes to tariffs and customers service offerings, this is not an area that is currently ripe for GISB development.   The attached Pipeline Segment position paper incorporates the concepts identified above into the BPS recommendation and is offered as an alternative to the BPS recommendation.

I.             All correspondence and communications with regard to this filing should be directed to:   Shelley A. Corman Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Relations  Enron Transportation Services Company 1400 Smith Street, P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX  77251-1188 Phone:  713-853-7083 Email:  shelley.corman@enron.com   Nancy E. Bagot Enron Transportation Services Company Manager, Government Affairs Washington, DC  20006 Phone:  202-466-9148 Email:  nancy.bagot@enron.com   II. MOTION TO INTERVENE The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines.  2.      Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  In some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases Enron is a part owner.  These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines. The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party.  Thus, the Enron Interstate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest.  III. COMMENTS             The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein.             Like INGAA, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition.  First, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.  Second, the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates.                Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights.               For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment, the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition.

"I'm thinking that we may miss church altogether on Sunday.  We may spend the night at my inlaws in Conroe.  They have been bugging us to visit and I don't see another date on the calendar that will work.  Nov 3 for example, there is no children's church, but I am open/close trustee.  Don't worry about the CD player -- it's no problem.  I don't mind exchanging it until we get a CD player and duplicate copies of music (which I'm working on).   We received our INS approval to adopt Alina, but with court date delays etc., it looks like our most likely travel time is late November or early December.  When I get a little better info.  I will make Children's Church plans.  If it turns out that I'm gone several weeks in December, then perhaps we can talk Patty into letting the kids sit in regular church during Advent.  It is always such a fun time for them to be in church & they recognize so many of the songs.  If I'm only going to be gone in late Dec & first week of Dec, then we can probably continue with Children's church as planned.

As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above 5%. However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this tier of imbalance.  Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.  Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section 154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.

However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this tier of imbalance.  Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.  Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.

"Here is the other article=20  How Enron Blew It Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon= ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo= st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be= arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong? by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php> THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th= e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=  way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c= ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod= ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b= rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T= hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif= orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu= blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin= g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-= size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva= tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe= ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti= pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi= s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe= inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula= ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e= levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's = Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"" For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro= m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000= . It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per= cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil= lion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles th= roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,""=  notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma= rket intelligence to the energy business. This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine= d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b= y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old = formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then = selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co= mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=  to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E= nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor= ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y= ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning = power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was = new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra= ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T= he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo= rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe= eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great mar= riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me= ntality of the financial markets."" The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en= d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=  was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ= an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a = culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t= he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh= o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=  the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=  company couldn't possibly go wrong. Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of = $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene= rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=  his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro= ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications= , in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o= nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha= nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer= tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha= t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame. ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about b= usiness-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone= -it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th= e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he = once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga= ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=  off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b= lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar= ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil= ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus= t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene= ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame= rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc= hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone cou= ld actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr= istmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all th= e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20 From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=  photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o= f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc= ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash= er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I = never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youn= gest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte= en-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get a= nything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design = on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure=  that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally= . Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it= s pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that wou= ld not have been good for me.""=20 He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand= some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi= duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=  underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r= eporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are = bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim= its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=  upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understa= nding this."" PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni= neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo= lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t= o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist= ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur= ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=  hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho= se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th= at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters = in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=  the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s= uch humiliation? But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti= es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g= as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque= ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v= olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede= ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl= y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=  from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa= s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc= o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc= toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V= ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar= dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H= NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat= e of Texas. HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte= mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska = pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i= n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=  in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like = Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being call= ed ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular= ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr= avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru= nning a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a=  better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at tha= t time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change."" Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=  debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had = exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole = new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s= tarted.=20 LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha= d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h= ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I= llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I l= iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told Busines= sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling = wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he = was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w= hat he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and=  he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth= odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too= k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi= s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-= up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as = a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20 It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless= , and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=  all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr= ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al= one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w= here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=  called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th= e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be = a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the = risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv= estment bank would. Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" The= n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec= utives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says= , ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej= ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th= en said, ""Let's go."" The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=  cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze= ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho= se divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would=  be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and = even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching= , the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's = character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=  joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in= ."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr= on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo= r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit= . After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back."" Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha= d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w= ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of = gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin= ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b= est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted = to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b= etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m= ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p= rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi= th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could = have ever imagined. THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m= ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin= ess. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a s= kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos= t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o= f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=  industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b= older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make = money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to=  create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The peo= ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na= rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."" Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s= martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be= cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he = wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big= gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B= oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""a= ggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w= ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20 You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston h= eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee= n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=  day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a= bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense = of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest = candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t= he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing = Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma= ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more = than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof= ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun= g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.) For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a= nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc= turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g= lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com= pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=  with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th= e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr= on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou= ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov= erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra= m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t= en at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with=  the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about th= e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."" Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts= , associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos= e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a= nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus= es-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=  make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un= til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div= ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders = with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus= . And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join= ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of= f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp= ectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'= d say,"" one loyalist says.=20 And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m= erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b= uzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie= ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=  Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv= ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega= n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa= ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se= rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer= e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo= rts). But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m= ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, = the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar= gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio= n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $= 2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=  in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New = York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill= ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran= sforming another. ""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,""=  sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilitie= s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed For= tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl= e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million= , up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis= cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste= el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=  client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg= e against the usual winter downturn? But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c= ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be= came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o= nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi= d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr= on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt= y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi= ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha= t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=  deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=  in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strat= egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo= dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insis= ted. There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: = the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c= ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust= omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t= o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli= ents as customers and began calling them ""counterparties."" Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m= aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=  overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur= e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi= l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un= derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark= ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals= , from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene= d at all.=20 While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-marke= t accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c= ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=  idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge= t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an= nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How= ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=  went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig= ht be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" inves= tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark= et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec= t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't = going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" = says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp= any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=  for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c= ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe= ting literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away=  for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says. As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created = took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En= ron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change st= arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most = of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t= he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove= rhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an in= telligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl= e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa= rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to= o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done. And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension= . The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S= killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s= ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t= hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu= ickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi= sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc= iate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=  store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro= n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att= itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur= e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr= on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=  he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m= ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere. Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: = ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s= ight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de= als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u= ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte= n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became a= n Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says=  one former Enron executive. In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr= ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=  E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on= e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, = but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi= s way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y= ou bleed to death."" BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy = company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J= ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i= ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea= lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d= ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr= on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr= ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm= ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the tim= e for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=  ""It was the technology era."" To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe= cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye= ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n= ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th= e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En= ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed = $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o= f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on= e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including = two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo= rate America. But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi= a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w= ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p= ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c= hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth= er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals= , and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew. Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio= ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin= g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen= tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin= g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=  deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d= ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a= s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=  visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa= ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar= k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, = Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti= lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri= vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate= st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth= er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20 But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a = business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li= ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=  it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an= d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started = out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=  diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start=  afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=  Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old = culture than running a business.""=20 As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=  announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is wh= en the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely=  well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-= power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac= le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t= he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L= ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg= e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo= od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent = anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=  the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif= ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t= ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d= eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=  was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we= aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=  January. Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The = India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of = constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa= tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th= at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population = and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a=  very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo= rate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi= te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big= gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c= are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (Californi= a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=  be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al= l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo= ke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down = with its lights on."") But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had = been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=  believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=  it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=  buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi= on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d= id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim= e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma= rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=  Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street. Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t= he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D= uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal= lenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported = hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit= s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse= ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr= omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""Th= ere wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n= ow. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."" The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske= d in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforw= ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing = in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray= ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L= ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour= nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with= in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl= e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th= e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio= nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Stre= et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,= "" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca= rry more weight."" This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e= xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as = the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec= retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th= eir ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says.=  ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th= ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'""=20 Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=  now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi= p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as=  one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit= h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati= on that's better suited for good times than bad."" As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto= ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=  and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe= es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi= m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named = a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors= , and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and = everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovat= e much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performanc= e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate= gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo= rale problem."" That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=  of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=  their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi= th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie= ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh= en the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detra= ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits. But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he s= ays with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int= erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."" Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims= elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech= nologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone d= ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon= d wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the w= orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f= act, he is already shopping for office space. ""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. = ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g= et it.""","kay.miller@enron.com, w..mcgowan@enron.com, steve.january@enron.com,   lynn.blair@enron.com, mary.darveaux@enron.com",shelley.corman@enron.com,Texas Monthly November 2001: How Enron Blew It,2001-10-24 14:59:23-07:00,sent

"I thought that you would enjoy reading this article about Chad's school.  My editorial notes are added in red.  Keeping watching www.houstonisd.org/bushes for when they post pictures of the event.  AWESOME VISIT On Friday, October 19, President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush visited our school. The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of Afghanistan. Right in front of the entire student body, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $1, 147.00! The children were very impressed! The day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our children were stellar! The program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school. Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement! As the President and Mrs. Bush entered the stage, the children waved paper dollars in the air to greet them. The program opened with the singing of the school song. Carmen Sullivan gave a history of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and Kelly Iko (this is our Kelly from Sunday School -- whom I'm sure will be the first minority President of the United States)  led the group in the Pledge. The students sang God Bless America and waved individual flags. Not an eye was dry! It was awesome.

As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above 5%. However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this tier of imbalance.  Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.  Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section 154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the ""RIMS"" link, select ""Docket#"" and follow the instructions  (call 202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.

"Kevin/Rod - One line item on the TW counterparty revenue summary probably requires explanation.  The report shows a net $4.2 million payment to PG&E for transportation.  This is because PG&E released capacity at rates in excess of the maximum rate due TW -- thus PG&E was due a credit.  This was not a liability to TW, as the other side of this capacity release is embedded in the revenues paid to TW by other counterparties.     -----Original Message----- From: Corman, Shelley  Sent: Wednesday, October 24, 2001 8:49 PM To: Howard, Kevin A.

" Hi Ginger & Chris,  Hope you are doing well.  Just wanted to check in and make sure that you received the notarized copies of my INS approval.  When I spoke with Ginger a few days ago, she said that she thought we would travel 10 days or so after the Almaty group, probably in late November.    After I get off the phone I always think of  questions I should have asked.  Since my questions are not critical, but process in nature, I thought I'd drop an email.   I am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel.  How long does translation take?  What happens after that?  When is the dossier sent to Kazakstan?  Typically, how much notice are people given of their Kazak court date?  I would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the Christmas holiday -- as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in Houston.   Sorry for so many questions.  I know that you are both very busy and I know that patience is definitely in order with this process.  I am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that I am realistic about the steps involved.

"With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items:  1. When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the Enron building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.  I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.  It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it.  2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.  I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804.  The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern.

I haven't gotten any response from you. The facilities help desk did get the service elevator monitor in Gas Control fixed. I would still like to work with someone to address the bulleted issues I listed in the original note below. In addition to those, there are a couple more issues that have surfaced recently.   1) Given the planned restacking of the building and the significant increase in employees housed in EB, how does this impact the evacuation plan for the building when a complete evacuation is required?  [Woods, Steve]  Compared to our present population at Enron Center North (EB) the population will actually be less once all moves are completed.  [Woods, Steve]  The evacuation we completed on 9-11-01 after the N.Y. disaster went very quickly and without incident.   2) How are we supposed to be notified after-hours of weather related or any other events that security considers a threat to the building where they are recommending evacuation?  During a recent weather event we were inside Gas Control (I believe it was Thursday evening, 09/20) and we did not get any notification, but we have been told that security was on a number of floors telling employees to evacuate due to a tornado threatening downtown. [Woods, Steve]    Security console is supposed to notify Gas Control when weather approaches,  we have reviewed these procedures and they are in place.  I will ask security to follow up on this issue.   Let me know who to work with.

Recent events would suggest that we need to be auditing these issues routinely. I assume you have worked with Wackenhut consultants or some other organization to perform these types of  reviews in the past. These issues are generally addressed as secondary issues in the IT audits, but I think it might be best to address physical security reviews using qualified security professionals, rather than IT auditors. Bob Hagen and Jean McFarland are working on some significant enhancements to our existing Business Continuity processes and this would fit right in. Please let us know who we can work with to begin the review of the issues below ASAP.  By the way, I called the facilities help desk with two issues last week and haven't heard back from anyone.

"   Shelley, do you still want the report Terry is doing each Monday for the TW SOCAL and West  of Throeau numbers.  We started this report after switching to allocations before confirmations  so we could track any possible ""holes"" in the pipe.

"To:  Gas Control From:   Shelley Corman Subject:  Fire Drills and Emergency Response  Periodically we review our procedures during fire drills in the building. Historically, I understand that the Gas Controllers on duty have not moved to the stairwells during a drill. We need to change that practice. We are required by the Fire Marshall to have everyone move to the stairwells during future fire drills. The short time normally required to be away from the console until the all-clear is sounded should not impact the integrity of the pipeline systems.   We are also reviewing our short notice emergency response procedures. We have excellent procedures for events such as hurricanes, but we are preparing for events, such as a threat that would require everyone to leave the building immediately. Our interim offsite location in these situations is the Enron hanger at Intercontinental Airport. In the near future, we will be conducting a drill of these procedures, so don't be surprised if someone from our management team comes into Gas Control and asks you to proceed to the hanger on short notice.   Thanks in advance for your co-operation, and thank you for the great job everyone is doing.","donald.angeletti@enron.com, bill.bell@enron.com, dannis.bellard@enron.com,   mike.bryant@enron.com, steven.chambers@enron.com,   jodi.dobrinski@enron.com, thomas.hebert@enron.com,   byron.reid@enron.com, david.velen@enron.com, ricki.winters@enron.com,   jesse.alvarado@enron.com, roy.armitage@enron.com,   rodney.barnes@enron.com, richard.barry@enron.com,   keith.braswell@enron.com, sharon.brown@enron.com,   rory.calhoun@enron.com, steve.coash@enron.com,   jeffrey.cochran@enron.com, helen.cummings@enron.com,   michael.ellington@enron.com, jerry.graves@enron.com,   margaret.hall@enron.com, crandal.hardy@enron.com,   gaynel.henley@enron.com, melissa.heredia@enron.com,   steve.january@enron.com, bart.monden@enron.com, jeff.moore@enron.com,   robert.munson@enron.com, alan.muntz@enron.com,   dale.ratliff@enron.com, darrell.schoolcraft@enron.com,   allen.shafer@enron.com, ron.spain@enron.com, edward.welsh@enron.com",shelley.corman@enron.com,Fire Drills and Emergency Response,2001-11-07 06:52:55-08:00,sent

The operative word is it has been put on hold.  These are not normal times.  No one saw this coming or we could have planned better.  Give us a few days to figure everything out.  We just made the decision today to preserve cash while we were waiting to see what was going to happen.  Thanks for your cooperation which I desperately need right now.   -----Original Message----- From:  Corman, Shelley   Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 4:07 PM To: Hayslett, Rod Cc: Horton, Stanley; McCarty, Danny Subject: Floor Space Announcement   I was very disappointed to not have any advance warning about the announcement that construction on 41 has been put on hold for financial reasons.  The Gas Logistics team was ""relocated"" off the 41st floor on October 5.  Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.    After the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.  Prior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.  I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor.  And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes.  I hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.  Finding out  that we moved off of 41 for no reason at an all-employee floor meeting undermines my team's faith in my leadership.",shelley.corman@enron.com,stanley.horton@enron.com,RE: Floor Space Announcement,2001-11-07 15:45:47-08:00,received

"Yesterday I had a meeting with my staff to review recent events, including the revised earnings announcement last week, the merger agreement and anything else on their minds.    Perhaps besides the field, this may be the largest concentration of long-tenured employees.   Their personal financial losses are tremendous, especially when considered against their annual compensation.   As might be expected, they express their frustrations and resentments with Enron management.  Still, I am struck by their ongoing commitment to ETS and doing their jobs.  They seem eager to have the opportunity to show our accomplishments to Dynegy when the time is right.     They ask lots of questions.. most of which I could readily answer.    Here are two that I could not answer.  I'm hoping HR can help me with responses:  - Prior corp. correspondence said that the Click at Home program is under review.  One employee reported that he tried to log in to order a computer this week and the system was unavailable.  They want to know whether this means that the program has been canceled.  - I received several questions about Savings Plan/ESOP loans.  Is there any requirement for accelerated loan payment if the value of the loan exceeds the current value of the savings plan account?","danny.mccarty@enron.com, gary.smith@enron.com, fran.fagan@enron.com",shelley.corman@enron.com,Recap of Gas Logistics Staff Meeting,2001-11-14 09:10:03-08:00,sent

"I know that the long term solution rests with Charlie Thompson.  But, Caroline, I'm frankly shocked at GMS seeming lack of concern for the seriousness of this situation.  I have serious leadership questions about a group that could continue to receive charts in after the 5th of the month (on ALL 16 charts!) and continue to just file these reports without ever even looking at them or making corrections.  When ask why they never raised the issue or brought it to management's attention, their response is that this is the way we've done things for 20 years.    I'd like to visit with you about the leadership and direction of the GMS group.  No problem with measurement data is ever GMS responsibility -- its always someone elses fault -- the field didn't get the info in in time, the OMV wasn't received, the system doesn't work....What is the level of service that GMS is accountable for.  Please understand that this criticism is not directed to you.  I'd just like a chance to brainstorm with you one on one about how we ever have this group enter the 21st century with the rest of us -- befort Dave Neubauer raises his frustrations to the highest levels of ETS.      -----Original Message----- From:  Barnes, Caroline   Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 8:46 AM To: Stern, Ellis; Corman, Shelley Cc: Anderson, Gary E.

Meeting  Shelley, I would like to see Charlie Thompson or a representative from operations at this meeting since a major issue which will have to be addressed is the physical measurement equipment on NNG's pipe. GMS has not had much success in getting measurement equipment upgrades out of operations.  Customer issues may be the justification needed for the upgrades.

" Liz - Right after I had Kim run over with the revised form and put it in the overnight, Chris called me to say that the application will probably need the ""sworn and subscribed"" language before the notary stamp.     Do you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp?  Or perhaps feed it through your computer printer?  I sent three signed and notarized copies -- so you have a few extras to play with.    Here is the missing language   STATE OF TEXAS   COUNTY OF HARRIS  Sworn and subscribed before me on this 26th day of November, 2001.    My conversation with Chris was quite different than my conversation with Ginger.  While she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like Jan 5 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares.  She also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around Dec 17 might be possible if one didn't mind being away at Christmas.  On my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in Astana.  When I called her back she said that this was a mistake -- that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in Astana on Thurs or Fri.

Hi Shelley: Perhaps we can talk tonight about several things I need to coordinate with  you. (1)  Children's Church schedule for December.  I talked to Steve Hoyle, and  he did not have a preference one way or the other about Children's Church for  the Cantata Sunday.  He did say the music program was rather long, with lots  of dialogue.  I am inclined to say let's have C/C, and I can commit to being  there.  Of course, we need at least 2 others to commit as well.  Since it  would be rather long, I would be in favor of supplementing the C/C service  with a Christmas-themed video. (2)  Have you looked into food from McDonald's for the Christmas party?  I am  working on the invite's, and tentatively am putting down on the RSVP card a  meal preference of hamburgers or chicken nuggets (check one.)   That way, we  can go either way with Happy Meals or just the basic food and fries,  depending on cost, ease of packaging, etc.  Let me know what you think and if  you need help with looking into this. (3)  I saw some cute ""Happy Birthday, Jesus"" themed trinkets in the Oriental  Trading catalog.  If you think we need more things for the treat bags, this  is a possibility.  They also had a cute plastic treat bag with this theme  that was fairly inexpensive.  (I can't remember if you said you already had  bags or were still going to get them.) I could talk tonight after 9:00, if that is convenient for you. Thanks, Shelley!

NNG is a separate business and is not responsible for ENA invoices to their customers.  3.  Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly.  4.  Creditworthiness status for ENA remains the responsibility of the Commercial Department.

"  Our team holiday potluck luncheon is scheduled for Tuesday, December 11 at 11:30 AM.    So dust off those cookbooks and sign up to bring a culinary creation.  The sign-up sheet is located outside Ricki's workstation (4268A).   The buffet will be set up in 42C1 (the gas control presentation room).  Room 42C2 is also reserved for seating.    Following our luncheon, we will have a Gas Logistics staff meeting at 1 PM in 39C1.  We can discuss any Enron updates and I will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have.      At the end of our staff meeting, we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing.   We have lots of fun prizes, including many sets of sports tickets.  All Gas Logistics employee names will be entered.  You need not be present to win.  Finally, I want to fill you in on my upcoming journey.  My husband and I have been trying to adopt a young girl from Kazakhstan into our family.  The paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and I was having doubts whether it would ever happen.  Early this week I received the call that I need to travel to Kazakhstan next week to pick her up.  While I am excited to complete the adoption, I'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time.  At our staff meeting, I can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence.  I'm looking forward to our get together next week.  To the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, safe and relaxing holiday season.

"Sorry for the delay.  My wallet and checkbook were stolen on Fr night & I spent all day yesterday getting things in order...after the thief charged $6000 on my credit and debit cards!  Remember that conversation we had about 2001.   I did little research on Compuserve and AOL.  Both have acess numbers in Almaty Kazaknstan -- where I'll be at least 1 week of my journey.  Looks like they both use the same access numbers and both charge a $6 connect fee.  So I don't see the advantage of adding AOL -- unless you see something I don't.  Here's the catch -- neither has service from Moscow.  So I'll be out of lunch in Moscow unless I can find an alternative ISP.     I'm at regional type hotels in Kazakstan.

Our  customer operations guys tell me this is a pretty straigtforward exercise.O bviously, given the 13 days until comments are due, time is of the essence. So  please respond by COB Tuesday, if possible. 1. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from an affiliated interstate pipeline? For all these interconnects, how much  gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000? 2. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from affiliated gatherers, processors, or intrastate pipelines? For all these  interconnects, how much gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000? 3. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that deliver gas  into affiliated intrastate pipelines? For all these interconnects, how much gas  flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000? Additionally, Michael Doane, the economist INGAA has retained, would like to  have the following information for his report. It can be anecdotal, but having  something concrete to point at is critical. He needs all the examples we can  provide of existing infrastructure (gathering-to-pipeline,  processing-to-pipeline, production-to-affiliated gathering and pipeline) that  would not have gone forward if pipelines were not allowed to coordinate with  their midstream and production affiliates. If at all possible, state the natural  gas deliverability that's there today, which would not have been there. under  the proposed rule. As you'd suspect, this also has to be done as quickly as possible. Get the  information to me, and I'll forward it to Michael. Thanks for your help.

MK   -----Original Message-----  Subject: Data for Comments and for Economist's Report   In order to give some concrete statistics for our argument that midstream and  production affiliates are important links in the infrastructure with affiliated  pipelines (and, of course, that applying the NOPR to pipeline affiliates would  be a disaster), please provide data to answer the following three questions. Our  customer operations guys tell me this is a pretty straigtforward exercise.O bviously, given the 13 days until comments are due, time is of the essence. So  please respond by COB Tuesday, if possible. 1. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from an affiliated interstate pipeline? For all these interconnects, how much  gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000? 2. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from affiliated gatherers, processors, or intrastate pipelines? For all these  interconnects, how much gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000? 3. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that deliver gas  into affiliated intrastate pipelines? For all these interconnects, how much gas  flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000? Additionally, Michael Doane, the economist INGAA has retained, would like to  have the following information for his report. It can be anecdotal, but having  something concrete to point at is critical. He needs all the examples we can  provide of existing infrastructure (gathering-to-pipeline,  processing-to-pipeline, production-to-affiliated gathering and pipeline) that  would not have gone forward if pipelines were not allowed to coordinate with  their midstream and production affiliates. If at all possible, state the natural  gas deliverability that's there today, which would not have been there. under  the proposed rule. As you'd suspect, this also has to be done as quickly as possible. Get the  information to me, and I'll forward it to Michael. Thanks for your help.

Thanks for your leadership on this issue.  The commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and I haven't made much headway with the GMS folks.  I'm glad you are involved!

"   P.O. Box 320932 Cocoa Beach, Florida USA 32932-0932  28 December 2001    Subj:   What Every Corporate Executive, Investor, And Citizen Should Know About Wall Street.       US Senator Byron Dorgan Chairman US Senate Subcommittee On Consumer Affairs P.O. Box 2579 Bismark, North Dakota 58502 senator@dorgan.senate.gov <mailto:senator@dorgan.senate.gov?subject='What Every Corporate Executive, Investor, And Citizen Should Know About Wall Street.'>     Dear Senator Dorgan,              Why Is Government Protecting The Real Thieves?   The sale of counterfeit securities is the vehicle for blatant thievery of Enron and other securities!              Evidence Of Counterfeiting:   The fact that short sold receipts are never issued by the represented public company; in simple terms, this means they are bogus, counterfeit receipts representing shares of legitimate stocks or bonds.   Falsified publicly reported data then helps to conceal the malicious scam.              Who Is Behind This Counterfeiting Operation:   How it's done, why it's done, and those protecting it may surprise many.   Remember, when the Public is buying the Thieves are selling opposite the public while often holding price down to sell even more ... especially when legitimate shares are not available.              Deliberately Engineered   economic hard times and bankruptcies are sure to follow.   The Thieves are not going to buy back their bogus receipts in a legitimate market ... they're protected and the laws are ignored as they share illicit fortunes via secret unaudited omnibus accounts.   It's all in US Congressional reports.

Does Fri at 10 work for you?  I may be in tomorrow too after I make sure Alina won't freak out with the babysitter.  Next week sounds fine for vacation.  I wasn't able to use the global phone in Kazakhstan. But a friend recently rented one and used in Europe.  The neat thing is that you use you're reg cell number.

Teb was highly concerned about this in light of the implicati= ons it could have on ultimately changing to a mileage rate base.

" Shelley, I would like your opinion on a statement we are considering  putting into a letter to Alliant to address some issues they have.  See what you think of this paragraph.  I am trying to think of another  word other than ""retroactively"" (that word bothers me).  They are trying  to get this letter out this week.  Thanks for your help.  Lynn   -----Original Message----- From:  Sebesta, Chris   Sent: Tuesday, January 15, 2002 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: Alliant Retro Schedule Language   In our meeting, it was suggested to delete the phrase where Northern ""would only consider a change which includes but is not limited to ..."" and rewrote as follows:  Alliant requested Northern be more flexible and, if requested, consider from time to time to make retroactive scheduling changes.  Northern's practice is to NOT retroactively schedule quantities.  At any time a shipper has requested a review of scheduled quantities, Northern will review the situation on non-discriminatory, case-by-case basis.  If a situation arises, Alliant should call Lynn Blair at 713-853-7637.  Let me know if this is okay or if you have comments.  Thanks!

"Hi.  Sorry we missed rehearsal Sunday, but we are definitely still ""transitioning.""   We will be out of town on Sunday morning at a family gathering and will not be in church to sing.  We will be at choir practice Sunday evening.  I'll look for March and April songs for the Cherubs.  The videotape of the Christmas program is cute.  Maybe we can find a time to watch it.    -----Original Message----- From: lcorredo@csc.com [mailto:lcorredo@csc.com] Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2002 3:12 PM To: Taylor, Nancy; LMCorder@Shell.Com; Scorman@Enron.com; KMynarcik@hcch.com Subject: Children's Choir   Hello, Ladies.  I will not be at choir rehearsal on Sunday.  Nancy has the music we will be working on and will lead the rehearsal.  We sing at both services Sunday morning.  We are singing ""We are the Light"" which we sang in September.   The choirs will sing together.   I will be at both services.  Rehearsal went well on Sunday, but we were missing quite a few kids.  We rehearsed ""We are the Light"".  They know it.   We rehearsed a song that Nancy picked out for February - ""Here is the Church"".  I can't remember if that's actually the name of it.    It is such a nice song, I think the choirs should sing it together.  At one point, it goes . . . Here is the church, here is the steeple, open the doors and see all the people.  There are motions that go with that.    I think it would be cute if the Cherubs sing that part alone and do the motions alone, at least the first time we sing it in the song.  March is Palm Sunday.  Let's look for a cute song for the Cherubs to sing. I think we'll re-use last year's song for the Sonshine Singers.  We need a song for April for each choir.   Steve mentioned he had a song that he really liked, but I haven't seen it and don't know what type of song it is.  We can take a look and see what we think.    We can look in our books and find something for the Cherubs.  We started working on a song in the spring program that is to the tune of ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game.""   We didn't get very far on it.  There are a lot of songs to learn, and I'm shooting to have tapes ready by Sunday so they can start listening to it.  I'm attaching a schedule.  The program date hasn't been confirmed.   I know the confirmation class's mystery trip is that weekend.  I don't know whether that will interfere or not.  (See attached file: Choir Schedule - Spring 2002.doc)  I've got three 4:00 - 6:00 rehearsals planned, but we may not need them.

This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron?s Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.  To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron?s stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.  The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron?s remaining management team to direct the company?s ongoing operations.  I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.  During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world?s most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.  Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

"   The market took very close to the 1550 schedule.  We shifted extra linepack East of Station 13 prior to the scheduled downtime.  In the middle of the night last night it became apparent that station 13 was not going to come back on-line -- vibration problems.  Allan Weatherford has another crew coming in who may have another idea for resolving the problem. He will notify Rick Craig first thing this morning.  If you see Rob or Bob you may want to mention this problem at 13 to them -- sometimes they call in.  Previously we had this same problem at station 13 because the station was incorrectly designed with too much pipe unsupported above ground.  The weather forecast shows mild weather, and we can continue to meet a 1550 market demand with station 13 down.",shelley.corman@enron.com,mike.bryant@enron.com,weekend update,2002-01-28 05:08:08-08:00,received

" Hi Mrs. Traylor,  Obviously things have been a bit chaotic in our family life as we try to get Alina (""Chad's new adopted sister) settled into our routines.  We have been trying to keep Chad's routines as normal as usual, including bedtime and homework time.  While he seems happy with school, I have noticed decreasing marks on his homework and practice tests.  This especially concerns me with respect to his math -- where he has always been an excellent student.  Do you have any suggestions to help Chad with timed practice tests?  Do you recommend any particular classes (Kumon, etc) or workbooks?  If you think it is appropriate to meet to talk about Chad's progress, I could come to school anytime this Friday, February 1 for a conference.

"Patty, Stephanie & Barbara,  I have samples of Group's VBS curriculum and Children's Church curriculum and would like to get together and see what you think.  Group's VBS this year is called Bug Safari (think ""Bug's Life"").  The bible lessons are about David and play on theme of little in size, big in spirit.  The video (that can be used during refreshment time & is the basis of our Friday evening program) features Chatter the Chipmunk -- so we could reuse the adorable costume Ann Turney made.  I would like to select the curriculum with you guys before we have our volunteer luncheon (which I would like to do in late Feb or early March).   I would also like to agree on the date in mid-late July for VBS.  I think I currently have 2 weeks penciled on the church calendar.  I also have ordered samples of Group's Children's Church curriculum.  I have been struggling lately with inspiration for new lessons and some pre-prepared lessons might help us draw in additional volunteers.  Most of our volunteers are enthusiastic about helping -- but not preparing -- a children's church worship.    Evening meetings are difficult for me right now -- as there is much to do in the evenings and little time.  I would love to meet sometime this weekend if you are available.  (Kim will be out of the country the first few weekends in Feb.) or I can meet on Fri. Feb 1 or Fri.

Gregory; Pavlou, Maria; Kirk, Steve Subject: RE: NNG's GISB Comments   Maria, I've attached below an exchange of Dynegy e-mails on the topic of the 1 hour advance notice.  My concern, as expressed in the e-mail below, is the complexity (and cost/benefit) of getting to a real-time, on-line interactive computer system, versus one that requires some processing time. I'm not sure how the Northern computer system is designed, but this may be work raising.   I also raise the issue of how this works with EDI nominations (assuming anyone is actually using EDI these days).  Again, I'm not sure if this is relevant to the Northern system, but this reflects my recollection of the way the pipelines in general used to explain to us how their systems worked (i.e., batched processing, rather than interactive; all mandatory fields filled in).  My recollection is dated by a few years, so pipelines may have changed this once they went on the internet, rather than EBBs and EDI.  I would also note that this was written before the Northern announcement was made.  However, I have to admit that all my Dynegy pals have accused me of going to other side since I've been at IP.  I've fine with your comments.  I'll provide you with my correct address tomorrow.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Kathy Patton/DEC/Dynegy on 01/29/2002 requests comment on whether it should adopt the one-hour prior notice requirement.

  NNG - Called SOL Sunday morning for Sunday's Gas day.  The Reps  called as many customers as they could to let them know.  We had  the SOL posted on the WEB before 9:00 a.m.  We also did a pop up  on TMS for any customer logging into the system.   New TW HOTLINE will be implemented this week.  We are working with  Kim Watson and TK.   We did a production migration last night (Sunday).  So far everything is  OK.     TW was quiet this weekend from a scheduling perspective.   Thanks.

This isn't the language that we ageed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp.  I thought I sent Jim an email over the weekend.    The language needs to say that Enron has advised that it is willing to treat UBS as an affiliate. .

Then we will have 45 days to repath Nov-Feb Reservation & Commodity invoices for all Firm & Interruptible transport contracts, using the settled rates.  (The SLA Settlement reduces the rates that have been in effect since June, 2001, but it doesn't roll them back  to the RP98-302 rate case rates.)  The timing & process will be similar to what we did in August, 1999.  I would put the revised rates into TRS right after the February Commodity Invoices go out (around 3/12).

Storage contracts shouldn't be affected, either.  We will use the February Commodity PPA cycle for the Commodity part of the refund. We will use the March Reservation PPA for the Reservation part of the refund. We would probably mail the refund PPA invoices at the end of March, just before the March Reservation Invoices go out on April 1. The refund dollars would hit the 3/2002 GL.  If we follow the same plan as 8/99, then commodity PPAs will be shut off after the current, 1/2002 commodity invoices. Any non-SLA related PPAs would have to wait until the March Commodity invoice cycle in April. If there are pending PPAs that need to be released in this invoice cycle, it would be a good idea to do so.  I'll resurrect the August, 1999 schedule and modify it later in the week.  Then, we can schedule a preliminary meeting to figure out what needs to happen.

" My thoughts are written into the document  -----Original Message----- From: Erb, Kim [mailto:KErb@houston.deepwater.com] Sent: Wednesday, February 06, 2002 10:34 AM To: Shelley Corman (E-mail) Subject: SPRC Meeting   Shelley,  What do you think?  Beez,  Since our telephone conversation concerning the special SPRC meeting, I have prayed/thought about the topic and have the following opinion.  While I agree that this decision has to be made with the good of the entire congregation in mind, I would like to say that my family and I feel that our family and the congregation have benefited from Ernie's practical and humble approach to Christian living.  We have witnessed Ernie handle delicate situations with compassion and consideration.  We also appreciate Ernie's support during Alina's difficult transition to our home and at ACEC.    Ernie may not deliver the most inspiring sermons, may not be as outgoing as prior pastors at the church, and may not display managerial qualities in dealing with church staff. Certainly these are important considerations, and perhaps the most important considerations for a pastor of a church the size of AUMC.  But, I just want to make sure I raise up those gifts that I think Ernie has brought to the church.  Ernie is the type of person that helps to fix a flat tire, helps pack up the folding chairs after an event, or gives a stranded member a ride home.  In some ways it seems to me that Ernie is more comfortable leading by quiet example than being a formal leader.  I believe that it has been good for our congregation to see that a pastor can get his hands dirty in the process of pastoring to his congregation.  Having said this, both Shelley and I realize that we don't have the day to day contact with Ernie in the church office setting and don't see the managerial issues that have been raised.  Furthermore, we don't believe we can afford to have AUMC's membership adversely affected if we intend to grow this church to minister to the needs of our growing community.   In summary, Ernie has my family's support if there is any opportunity to work through the concerns that have been raised, but AUMC is our home and whatever is best for AUMC, that is the direction we should take.  I will support the SPRC's decision.  Kim  ","'erb@enron.com, kerb@houston.deepwater.com",shelley.corman@enron.com,RE: SPRC Meeting,2002-02-06 10:47:26-08:00,sent

Travel and entertainment cards will be provided to any individual employed by the pipeline companies, who is required to travel on company business.   Each employee will be required to complete the attached application and agreement form, secure management approval and fax to Mary Ann Johnson at (713) 345-3479.   The T&E card will be mailed directly to the applicant.   Implementation Employees may use the T&E cards for domestic and international business travel.  Monthly, each employee will be required to complete an expense report utilizing the XMS system, if expenses are incurred.  https://expensexms.enron.com/ewp/ .    Approved business travel expenses will be reimbursed to the employee via direct deposit or check, depending on how your payroll is currently processed.  Personal use of the card is discouraged.  The Wright Express travel and entertainment card has contingent liability, whereas, the employee's personal credit may be evaluated if: * Outstanding balances exceeding $3,500 or delinquent payments beyond 25 days past the due date. * A monthly line of credit for business travel exceeding $3,500.  Employees who are required to travel on Company business and expect to exceed the monthly $3,500 spending limit, may request a higher limit.  If you routinely require a spending limit exceeding $3,500 per month, please check the box under ""Company Information"" on the attached application form.  Your request will be submitted to Enron Operations Service Management and Wright Express for approval.  You will be notified of approval or denial concerning your request.   All travel and entertainment MasterCard accounts are due each month to Wright Express.  Failure, by the employee to pay Wright Express each month, submit expense reports or submit receipts may trigger card cancellation.  Procedure The travel and entertainment procedure can be found on the ETS website at http://www.ets.enron.com/pandSM/Employees will be responsible to review this procedure and comply with all requirements.  Following receipt of the signed, approved application and employee agreement form, employees should expect to receive a T&E credit card within ten to fifteen working days, but no later than March 15, 2002.  Card Activation: Upon receipt of the travel and entertainment card, you will be required to follow the instructions on the sticker using the activation call-in number.  Following activation, you may immediately begin to use your T&E card.

Now, not only do you get to search and query the Argus site of plants information, including:   Nuclear units;  Fossil-fired units;  New generation;  Existing capacity;   You now also get instant updates sent by messenger to you - on the platform of your choice - so can act on the news virtually as it happens.   Who need this information - and why?   Analysts and traders need this information: Many of the new proposed plants that were expected to come on line are being cancelled or delayed - meaning that supply will tighten and operating costs will narrow. Each plant outage now has a more severe effect - spiking prices and decreasing supply.  Energy Argus' Power Outages updates give you instant notice of these outages so you can prepare immediately and determine ramifacations on power and fuel prices.     Power industry vendors: Outages mean opportunities - immediate notification means you get your foot in the door first.    WANT MORE INFORMATION?

She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -  1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the ""Dynegy transition"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption.  2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now.  3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the ""contract roll off"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption  4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more ""reasonable"" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable.  5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

"Sorry I missed you this morning.  Could you take a look at this description from the outline.    I checked with John O'Shea and its fine for us to work together on this. I'm back in my office.  Please give me a call at your convenience (x37083)  Competitive Threats  Northern's competitive position is bolstered by the presence of (1) long-term agreements, and (2) a configuration of small-diameter branchlines with multiple delivery points that function as an extension of the LDC's distribution system.  Minnesota: ? Northern's major Minnesota customers have contracts that extend through 2007.  Beyond current contract terms, there is a mid-high possibility of bypass in Minneapolis/Twin cities area (Alliance, Viking or Northern Border); low-medium bypass possibilities in Rochester and Mankato, MN (Alliance). Iowa: ? Northern recently extended the contract with its major Iowa customer (MidAmerican) thru 2005.   Beyond current contract terms, Northern will face competitive threats from NGPL in the Des Moines and Sioux City.  Wisconsin/Chicago: ? With several significant contract terms up for renewal in 2003, Northern will face competitive pressures in the Wisconsin and Chicago areas because market prices are below maximum tariff rates and due to the high concentration of competing pipelines.

" FYI  Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of our gas controllers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled.

Given the uncertainties of the status and ownership of the 40KVA UPS on EB44, and given Mr. Cooper's stated intention of moving out of this building, it simply doesn't make sense to spend the $28K estimated to leverage the 40KVA UPS on EB44.

"I was talking to Anita this morning and she was asking me if I knew what games we were going to at spring training - she heard an ad or something for it and it made it sound fun.  I think they are trying to decide what to do for Spring Break.  They me be planning a Florida Trip.  What should I be telling her????  So far I have been very vague about it, but at some point I'm going to have to be more specific.  I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I'd rather not spend the whole trip with them.     Cindy S.

"I'd tell her that we have actual tickets for games on Mar 9 (Astros) and Mar 13 (Indians), but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game.  We just pulled schedules from the web.  My feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to FL, you should say that I rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days.  I know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us .... but I'm afraid the kids will spill the beans. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)",cdick@mccoyinc.com,shelley.corman@enron.com,Re: Spring Break,2002-02-25 11:32:55-08:00,sent

With respect to the specific project listed:   1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.     With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:   2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.   3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.       An additional footnote should be added to the page.   4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.        -----Original Message----- From: Don.Vignaroli@dynegy.com [mailto:Don.Vignaroli@dynegy.com] Sent: Thursday, February 21, 2002 5:23 PM To: Len.Hesseltine@dynegy.com; John.O'Shea@dynegy.com; Dan.Dienstbier@dynegy.com; Carolyn.J.Stone@dynegy.com; Mary.Kay.Miller@dynegy.com; Dave.Neubauer@dynegy.com; Mike.Mcgowan@dynegy.com; Steve.Gilbert@dynegy.com; Keith.Petersen@dynegy.com; Lowry, Phil; Rice, Randy; Pribble, Dan; Nelson, Mike; Brassfield, Morris; Corman, Shelley; Hotte, Steve; Kleb, Steve; Concklin, Elaine Subject: Restated 2002 CAPEX Plan     Attached for your review and information is a copy of the Restated 2002 Capital Budget (25 page report) which reflects the planned CAPEX recently agreed to between NNG/Dynegy and Enron.

" I just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.  The final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases:  1. By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.  2. With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.  Commissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.  Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.  The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.    The discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.  The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct.  -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.","bradley.holmes@enron.com, elizabeth.brown@enron.com, theresa.hess@enron.com",shelley.corman@enron.com,Discussion on GISB Partial Day Recalls,2002-02-27 09:30:52-08:00,sent

The No Notice imbalance of 1,616 that was recorded as ENA's imbalance should have been on Pratt and Whitney's own DPOA contract, but was not because the old system and the new system needed to be synchronized.  Most of this imbalance was traded with FGU (they forgot about the 40 mmbtus of fuel) leaving only a small amount on ENA.  This situation has now been repaired so it will not be a problem prospectively.  Starting February,  the Pratt and Whitney point in on FGU's DPOA.

"Here is what I had sent to Rod an update.  cvb   -----Original Message----- From:  Barnes, Caroline   Sent: Tuesday, March 05, 2002 10:12 AM To: Hayslett, Rod Subject: Question and Update  1. Steve Hotte would like to know if any other groups are capturing their time in SAP spent on the Dynegy Transition.  He has his group charging to an E work order which settles to NNG.  He asked me if I was charging to NNG all the time I am having to spend and I am not.  If he has the only group doing so than he plans on stopping the practice.  Please advise.  2. Update on the NNG Measurement procedures/expectations: ? I met with both Shelley and Don ? The info Don gave me was the final conclusion of the Continuous Improvement project which recommended that all of Measurement be brought into one organization.  Of interest is that in the recommendation, it is stated that ""The evaluation concluded that any partial implementation, i.e: moving any single group such as GMS into new reporting relationship in not recommended."" ? Current thinking of what will be presented: a. Time lines for, Field Chart changing and mailings, GMS chart processing, Fixed deadlines for Measurement close, Commodity invoices, PPA processing, GISB/Tariff requirements. b. Written bullet point procedures indicating each department roles and responsibilities related to billing Measurement data.  Departments covered, GMS, Field, Measurement Desk, IT, Gas Accounting c. Steve Klimesh is gathering from the different NNG field regions the following: What are the field teams instructions, AND WHO PROVIDES THE INSTRUCTIONS, relative to the timing (when should they be sent/submitted) for submitting the following documents to GMS (Houston) throughout the month? I only need to know for Northern Natural Gas activities. Test Reports: Change reports: Spot Sample quality data: Continuous proportionate to flow sample data: Chromatograph Data: Unmetered gas reports: Other measurement related data/documents:  Shelley noted that in the current UAF detail field procedures there is no focus on the business deadlines so the reason for a separate set of procedures outlining roles and responsibilities.  It is intended that this would be concise enough that it could be printed on a card and handed out to all involved.  Shelley will also pull together the GISB and NNG Tariff language referencing measurement deadlines and approved estimating procedures.  Let me know if you have any questions or if we are heading in the wrong direction of what you expected.  cvb",shelley.corman@enron.com,caroline.barnes@enron.com,FW: Question and Update,2002-03-06 14:52:52-08:00,received

" Jeffri,  I have received the revised W-2 forms from Enron that increases my reported income to reflect my non-eligibility to participate in the dependent daycare spending accounts.

" FYI Regarding Mn EC Closing.  I really enjoyed our talk last night.  You gave me some really good advice.    I'm sure that vacation/going out of town is the very last thing that you feel like thinking about, but when you're up to travel thoughts let me know if you would be interested in going to the Hill Country Hyatt some weekend.  I think Alina would love the water rafting.  We could go the weekends of May 11, 18 or 25 if you are interested.  Talk to you soon.  Chad really, really wants to have Tom come over to play soon!   -----Original Message----- From: Adam Rose [mailto:azr1@psu.edu] Sent: Friday, March 15, 2002 8:36 AM To: Mr. Jorn Aabakken; Mr. Gregory K.

Ziegenfus Subject: Closing of ENNEC Department Importance: High    --   Dear Alumns,  I'm sorry to have to convey the bad news that the Penn State  administration has decided to close the Department of Energy,  Environmental, and Mineral Economics effective July 1.   This  decision stems primarily from massive budget cuts confronting the  University in light of a significant decrease in state appropriations  and of a continuation of increasing costs of higher education.  Also,  despite acknowledged progress in Department accomplishments, we are  still lagging other EMS departments in major areas such as student  credit hours and external funding.  Finally, it is easier to close a  small Department, and one that is sometimes (and erroneously) viewed  as duplicating educational efforts in the economics area, than it is  to close a larger and more unique department in the College.  Fortunately, the University is formulating a plan with many positive  aspects for our faculty, staff, students, and with respect to  coverage of our fields of expertise.  Tenured faculty will be  shifting their appointments to other units in the College  (Meteorology, Geography) and elsewhere at Penn State (Business, Ag  Econ).  The staff has been promised at least equivalent opportunities  in EMS.  Continuing students will be provided the necessary courses  over the next two years to graduate.  New educational initiatives in  Environmental Risk Management and in Energy Business, and new  research initiatives associated with Penn State's new Environmental  Consortium will also serve to continue our intellectual tradition.  Still, there is no way of getting around the news that a wonderful  educational entity that has been home to so many wonderful people and  has contributed so much to education, the State of Pennsylvania, and  the larger world community, will soon cease to exist.  Please know  that our Department has worked valiantly for many years to amass  accomplishments that would stave off such a decision.  As Head of the  Department over the past fourteen years, however, I feel that I bear  the ultimate responsibility for this outcome.  I only wish that I  could have done more.  I regret that I have not kept in better touch with many of our  alumns.  Recently, and facilitated by the ease of using e-mail, we  had planned to start a semi-annual Alumni Newsletter.  The current  situation actually makes this even more imperative-the Department may  no longer exist but our Alumni Association can prosper indefinitely  if we participate actively in it.  Let me encourage you to spread the  word about our situation to alumns who have not received this  communication and to ask them to send me their e-mail addresses for  future communications.  A degree from Penn State's Mineral Economics Department, or the  revamped Department of Energy, Environmental, and Mineral Economics,  has served our alumns especially well over the past five decades.  There is no reason that it should not continue to do so.  Thanks,  Adam Rose Professor and Head",rwschatzman@aol.com,shelley.corman@enron.com,FW: Closing of ENNEC Department,2002-03-19 06:11:09-08:00,sent

" The FERC is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules, but I'll answer in the context of the current rules.  There are three main principles behind the current rules: 1. Pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate 2. Pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate -- unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info, and 3. Pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible.  There is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information, but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately.  For example, pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate -- we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better.  But, compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations - price, terms, etc. -- the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business.  There was a real case to this effect.  The pipeline & affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning.  The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting.  FERC found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline.  So, I'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info, but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions.   -----Original Message----- From:  Thames, Davis   Sent: Tuesday, March 19, 2002 12:29 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: affiliate rule  Shelley, dumb question, but I'm thinking in terms of general synergies for reorgco.
