"Tracy,  Attached is a spreadsheet model which contains both Black-Scholes and  American option valuation models.   These are the generally accepted methods  for valuation of options on equity.   The ""European"" option prices assume  that the option holder can exercise his options only at maturity, while the  ""American"" style options can be exercised at any time during their life.     I have assumed in the examples that the underlying equity units have a market  value of $13.00 and that the options are struck at this level.   The  volatility input is the other main assumption.   EOTT has been trading  recently with a volatility ranging between 30% to 40% although looking  further back, the range is much wider.  To run the model, you must be linked with the options library.   I am not  sure what lan you are connected with, but you can coordinate with Zimin Lu  (x36388) for help with loading the option library add-in module.   On the ENA  lan it is located under  O:\research\exotica\xll\exotica.xll.    This is  loaded in excel using the Tools/Add-Ins and Browse to reach the add-in  location.  --Stinson x34748    P.S.   I will mail you a hard-copy of a plot showing recent EOTT volatility  as well.   If you would like us to help you in running specific examples,  please let me, Vince, or Zimin know.",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,stinson.gibner@enron.com,Re: EOTT Options,2000-03-17 07:56:00-08:00,received

The IT billing group is going to refund you $360.00 for erroneous charges over the last year. I had them audit your bill, and they sent me a list of the things that shouldn't have been billed in the first place, and this is the amount you are due. You should notice it on your January bill. Please let me know if you do not see this (you'll probably get the bill in Feb.)  Secondly, the billing system is being changed as of Feb 1. Now that we are using the SAP system, you will no longer receive an itemized bill. All IT charges will be sent to the business unit, at a pre allocated/predetemined amount. This amount was agreed to by all business units. Basically everyone will be billed a single amount for all IT usage, and the Business Unit will be charged, not the individual.  The only things you will be billed for are as follows: Long distance charges Market Data Application charges  These things can actually be traced back to the individual(s).  This should make life much simpler.  I apologize, again, for the delay in handling this situation.

You will want to be a part of the exciting 2001 Show!  This year the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo will donate $8 million for scholarships that benefit youth and support education.  I am once again a member of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Carnival Ticket Sales Committee.    As part of that committee, I am selling carnival ticket books at half-price through February 9th, 2001.  This year there are two ways to save!  There is a book of 24 ride coupons and 2 2-for-1 refreshment coupons (drink and popcorn).  This is a $20 value available for only $10.     For an even better deal, there is a book of 125 ride coupons, a free ride on the Hurricane family ride coupon, and 12 2-for-1 refreshment coupons (including drink, cotton candy, popcorn, french fries, and ice cream).  This is a $110 value available for only $50.  The tickets are valid at the carnival February 8th - 10th and February 13th - March 4th.  All proceeds go to benefit the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Scholarship and Educational Funds.  I also have Advance Livestock Show tickets available for sale.  (A Rodeo ticket (good date of ticket only) or Livestock show ticket is required for admission to carnival.)  The prices are:   Adults (13 and over) are $6 each Children (6 through 12) are just $3 each Children under 6 will be admitted FREE Season passes are just $20  This year there is very limited parking at the Astrodome.  10 Metro park and ride lots will be available for your commute to the Dome.  The best part is, the ride is FREE!  You say you don't have children or don't attend the carnival yourself...anyone has the opportunity to sponsor underprivileged children to attend the carnival every year.  The price of sponsoring a child is $10 but any donation is accepted and will be combined with other donations received to sponsor children. Donors who contribute $1,000 or more, will receive rodeo badges that get you into the Livestock show for free.  All donations are tax deductible.  Any Enron employee donating money can have it matched by Enron.  Every $1 counts!   If anyone would like to purchase these tickets, they can contact me by phone at 713-853-5305, in the Enron Building in room 1354, or by email at debbie.yates@enron.com.  I have attached a flyer with all of the information.  Payment is accepted in the form of cash, MasterCard, Visa, American Express, or a check or money order made payable to the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo (HLSR).  I will be selling the ticket books until Friday, February 9th.  The 2001 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo schedule will be announced in the coming weeks!  I have attached the schedule for The Hideout.  For more information, visit the official Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo website at :  http://www.rodeohouston.com/.  Feel free to forward this note to anyone  you think might be interested.  Contact me with any questions.  If you no longer want to receive information from me about the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, please send me an email asking to be removed from my list.       Thank you for your support!

The program that produces this data will be in production later today, so I'll get you a file from PR1 then.  I had to zip it up because it was too big to deliver.  I'll set you up with an userid and password so you can pick these up off our interface server once it is scheduled in production.  I'm now settled in London.  If you need to reach me, I'm at 783-4269 (trunk+34269).

Subject: FW:  Think You're Having a Bad Day!  Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out section of forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with SCUBA tanks on his back, flippers, and face mask.  A post-mortem revealed that the person died not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification. Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire.  It was revealed that, on the day of the fire, the person went for a diving trip off the coast some 20 miles away from the forest. The firefighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean then flown to the forest fire and emptied.  You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next he was doing the breast stroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air. Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'-10"" of the fire. Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed! (This article was taken from the California Examiner)  STILL THINK YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in the kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding on to the handle bars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house.  The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room and found her husband laying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle laying next to him and the shattered patio door. The wife ran to the phone and summoned an ambulance. Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of stairs to the street to escort the paramedics to her husband.  After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital, the wife righted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas was spilled on the floor, the wife got some paper towels, blotted up the gasoline, and threw the towels in the toilet.  The husband was treated and released to come home. Upon arriving at home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while still seated.  The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin. The wife again ran to the phone to call the ambulance.  The very same paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself.   She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell down the remaining stairs and broke his arm.

These roles are considered incompatible roles, because the combinations of the roles should not be jointly assigned to a user, as such would compromise segregation of duties and is considered a business risk.

Darwin Awards 2000. They have   finally been released!   For those not familiar with the Darwin Award,  It's an annual honor given  to the person who provided the Universal human  gene pool the biggest  service by getting killed in the most extraordinarily  stupid way. As  always, competition this year has been keen again. Some  candidates  appear to have trained their whole lives for this event!    DARWIN AWARD CANDIDATES  1. In September in Detroit, a 41-year-old  man got stuck and drowned in  two feet of water after squeezing head first  through an 18-inch-wide =  sewer  grate to retrieve his car keys.    2. In October, a 49-year-old San Francisco stockbroker, who ""totally =   zoned  when he ran,"" according to his wife, accidentally jogged off a =   100-foot-high  cliff on his daily run.   3. Buxton, NC: A man died  on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he had dug  into the sand caved in as he  sat inside it. Beach goers said Daniel =  Jones,  21 dug the hole for fun,  or protection from the wind, and had been =  sitting  in a beach chair at  the bottom Thursday afternoon when it collapsed,  burying him beneath 5 feet  of sand. People on the beach, on the outer  banks, used their hands and  shovels, trying to claw their way to Jones,  a resident of Woodbridge, VA,  but could not reach him. It took rescue  workers using heavy equipment almost  an hour to free him while about 200  people looked on. Jones was pronounced  dead at a hospital.   4. In February, Santiago Alvarado, 24, was killed in  Lompoc, CA, as he  fell face-first through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he  was  burglarizing. Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in   his mouth (to keep his hands free) rammed into the base of his skull as   he hit the floor.   5. According to police in Dahlonega, GA, ROTC  cadet Nick Berrena, 20,  was stabbed to death in January by fellow cadet  Jeffrey Hoffman, 23, who  was trying to prove that a knife could not  penetrate the flak vest =  Berrena  was earing.   6. Sylvester  Bridal, JR, 26, was killed in February in Selbyville, Del,  as he won a bet  with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded  with four bullets  into his mouth and pull the trigger.   7. In February, according to police  in Windsor, Ontario, Daniel Kolta,  27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a  head-on collision, thus earning a  tie in the game of chicken they were  playing with their snowmobiles.   DARWIN AWARD HONORABLE MENTIONS    1. In Guthrie, Okla, in October, Jason Heck tried to kill a millipede =   with  a shot from his 22-caliber rifle, but the bullet ricocheted off of  a =  rock  near the hole and hit pal Antonio Martinez in the head,  fracturing his  skull.   2. In Elyria, Ohio, in October, Marty Eskins,  attempting to clean out  cobwebs in his basement, declined to use a broom in  favor of a propane  torch and caused a fire that burned the first and second  floors of his  house.   3. Paul Stiller, 47, was hospitalized in  Andover Township, NJ, in  September, and his wife Bonnie was also injured, by  a quarter-stick of  dynamite that blew up in their car. While driving around  at 2 AM, the  bored couple lit the dynamite and tried to toss it out the  window to see  what would happen, but they apparently failed to notice that  the window  was closed.   4. TACOMA, WA - Kerry Bingham, had been  drinking with several friends  when one of them said they knew a person who  had bungee-jumped from  the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the middle of traffic.  The conversation =  grew  more heated and at least 10 men trooped along  the walkway of the bridge  at 4:30am.  Upon arrival at the midpoint of the  bridge they discovered that no one  had brought a bungee rope. Bingham, who  had continued drinking, =  volunteered  and pointed out that a coil of  lineman's cable lay nearby. One end of  =  the  cable was secured  around Bingham's leg and the other end was tied to the  bridge. His fall  lasted 40 feet before the cable tightened and tore his  foot off at the  ankle. He miraculously survived his fall into the icy  river water and was  rescued by two nearby fishermen. ""All I can say,""  said Bingham, ""is that God  was watching out for me on that night.  There's just no other explanation for  it."" Bingham's foot was never  located.   AND NOW, FOR THE WINNER:    1. PADERBORN, GERMANY - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt   fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more   than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged up =   pachyderm  finally let fly - and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds  of poop!  Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give  the  ailing elephant an olive oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on =   him  like a dump truck full of mud. ""The sheer force of the elephant's   unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he =   struck  his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued  to  evacuate his bowels on top of him,"" said flabbergasted Paderborn police   detective Erik Dern. With no one there to help him, he lay under all   that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along, and during =   that  time he suffocated. ""It seems to be just one of those freak  accidents  that happen.""  ",jon.trevelise@enron.com,tracy.geaccone@enron.com,Fw: Darwin Awards 2000,2001-02-08 16:35:00-08:00,sent

This is the largest fundraising event for March of Dimes.  As you probably already know, March of Dimes is a non-profit organization focused on promotion of healthy babies and prevention of birth defects.  As you probably also already know, this is a cause near and dear to my heart.  In 1998, Enron provided no support for March of Dimes.   This was simply not acceptable for a company the size and stature of Enron.  Several of you agreed and we formed an Enron March of Dimes Walk Team.  A new team in 1999, we raised $12,000.  In 2000, Stan Horton lent us his executive support and we grew our efforts to $46,000 - earning us the position of 15th place of Houston March of Dimes Walk Teams.    Enron employees have shown that this is a cause that they want to support.  I believe that we can take our 2001 Enron Walk Team to the next level, achieving a goal of $75,000 and earning a place in the top ten Houston walk teams.  Danny McCarty has agreed to serve as our executive sponsor for 2001.  Of course to accomplish this goal, it will take a group of dedicated team leaders.  Please consider joining me in this effort.  I know you are all busy and running at full speed, but that is exactly why I need your help.  I believe that with a small but focused amount of your time over the next few weeks, we can accomplish significant results.  Fundraising is our primary goal, walking is not required!  Please give this some consideration and let me know in the next few days whether I can count on you to lead the team.    I am planning a kick-off luncheon for next Friday, February 16. I promise that this will be our one and only one formal meeting.  We can handle all other coordination and planning via email.

Data Warehouse Project Update  The cost reporting pilot has been built by Beverly Fennessy and the technic= al team based on the design Li Chan has specified based on your input from = the initial interviews, followups and several cost reporting workshops she = has sponsored in the last month.  The pilot will be a mini-cost reporting button, using a small subset of act= ual financial data from SAP-CO (one BU, three months of data), and showing = only the cost center information (not project info).  It is designed to tes= t this solution's (Acta/Oracle/Business Objects) ability to:  1.=09extract data from SAP using Acta, 2.=09report data using a team structure, 3.=09develop usable, presentable and technically efficient ""canned reports,= "" and 4.=09provide users an ad-hoc query tool for reporting and analysis not cove= red by canned reports.  The BU reps need to become familiar with the pilot, and all of our intervie= w participants are invited to see the pilot and evaluate the tool. We'll have a questionnaire for your comments and suggestions, which we will=  incorporate into the development of the actual cost reporting button.  The= re's a distribution list at the end of this memo - if you know of someone i= n your group who should attend, please invite them.   Assuming no significant changes are identified in the user review of the p= ilot, we expect at least a portion of the cost reporting from the data ware= house to be rolled into production by the end of April.  So be sure to voic= e your input!  The second part of the warehouse will be cash reporting.  Steve Frazier is = the BU rep leading this effort, with Mike Deville from Corp Reporting and S= usan Bellinghausen from the ISC providing input.  We are working on both di= rect and indirect cash flow (historical) and trying to determine the best w= ay to source the data.  We'd like to get it from SAP since that's where we = can get the most detail, with the Treasury workstation as the source for ma= nual wires not yet input into SAP.  However, Susan's group has told us that=  the current SAP design won't allow us to use the Cash Budget Management mo= dule since that information doesn't tie to FI (due to differences in value = date and posting date).  Therefore, we're looking at what SAP design change= s might be needed.  The next step will be earnings, which will expand cost reporting by bringin= g in gross margin, other income, interest expense, minority interest and ta= xes.  We're hoping to be able to tie into the Energy Ops Project Enlighten = (data warehouse) as a source of gross margin data for wholesale operations.  We envision that the counterparty reporting button will also interface with=  other Enron warehousing efforts, such as Global Counterparty.  A significant objective of the warehouse is to provide ad hoc reporting, so=  we will be looking at the data behind the reporting buttons and determinin= g which other information should be transferred into the warehouse in the e= arly phases.  Our strategy is to place only the information that is most re= quested into the warehouse in the early phases, but to design the warehouse=  to be flexible enough to allow additional fields to be transferred in over=  time.  Budgeting and Forecasting Tool  In our interviews, many people expressed an interest in an automated planni= ng tool.  We have looked at three products - SAP's SEM, Hyperion's Planning=  and Adaytum's ePlanning. Some of you attended a demo of Adaytum last week.=  We like because it seems to have the most functionality and  two Enron BUs=  already use it (Europe and EBS).  We want to be able to plan for earnings = as well as cash forecasting and projected balance sheets, with these number= s feeding the warehouse so that our reporting could include both actuals an= d plan or forecast.  We'd like to hear any thoughts you have on how you thi= nk your BU would use a tool such as this.  We're evaluating the valuation proposition now and expect to can make a rec= ommendation at Rick's February 27 staff meeting. =20  Susan Helton and James Weitekamp are working on this effort.  Close Process  Howard Selzer is leading the initiative to shorten the close process.  He i= s gathering close calendars from each BU and is talking with each group abo= ut possible opportunities to squeeze time out of the schedule.  He will als= o focus on topside entries (after the 8th workday) to determine how to elim= inate the need for these entries.  Glenn Kobes will provide the tax perspec= tive.  Knowledge Sharing  Joe Darensbourg is preparing a plan to share best practices among groups.  = He is also spearheading the Global Accounting Intranet site, which is one o= f the media we can use.  A Web Advisory Team has been formed so that each B= U will have input into how we can best communicate using this site (still w= aiting for ETS and Europe to appoint representatives to this team).  Ideas = for knowledge sharing include soliciting tips to be reviewed by the Web Adv= isory Team and then posted to the intranet site, forming user groups in coo= peration with the ISC (ETS has groups already in place), setting up a forum=  to ask questions of other users (either as part of eThink or separately) a= nd encouraging participation in the Houston ASUG (SAP user group).  We'll w= ant to coordinate with the ISC's efforts to avoid duplication (they have FA= Qs on their web site).  Alternate Hierarchies  Caroline Lothian is working to compare and document how the each BU uses al= ternate hierarchies for reporting. This specifically addresses team reporti= ng, but also includes anything other than the legal rollup.  A common desig= n for team report hierarchies is necessary to build canned reports in the d= ata warehouse, since we expect you will want to include data at drill-down = levels such as BU, line of business, team, profit center and cost center. B= eyond a team hierarchy, we're really looking to share best practices rather=  than build a common standard.  Number of Entities and Cost Objects  Currently we have about 1,900 legal or accounting entities and nearly 200,0= 00 cost objects in SAP.  As far as we know, this is the largest number amon= g all of SAP's customers.  We want to be proactive in controlling these num= bers before they have the possibility of bringing our systems to their knee= s.  In addition, the large number of entities and cost objects result in ex= tra costs related to tax compliance and accounting maintenance, as well as = the intangible costs related to higher complexity.  Jill Erwin is heading a= n initiative to first find out how the BUs use various cost objects and whe= ther there may be a way to simplify their use, and then to identify ways to=  ensure that new entities and cost objects are set up only when that is the=  best way to accomplish Enron's objectives.  Training and Change Management  In our interviews, we heard about some problems that may be able to be reso= lved through specific training.  We will also need training on the new tool= s and initiatives that will be implemented in Project Sunrise.  It is also = important for us to continue to communicate with various accounting groups = as to what Project Sunrise is doing so that we can ensure that we provide w= hat users really need.  Madeline Chan and Dave McEllin are taking the lead = on what approach we should take on training.  We have also spoken with the = Change Management team in the ISC (under Andy Lawrence), who has agreed to = provide direction and resources as well as help ensure that together we are=  providing seamless service to our users. =20 Other Issues  Other areas that we intend to address in Project Sunrise include the automa= tion of buckets and e-schedules, balance sheets by profit center, intercomp= any issues and foreign currency issues.  In addition, we working with Susan=  Bellinghausen and Rick Boehm (ISC) to provide better reporting related to = payroll distribution and labor distribution.  As you can see, this is a very broad project, and we want to be sure each B= U is properly represented.

Data Warehouse Project Update  The cost reporting pilot has been built by Beverly Fennessy and the technic= al team based on the design Li Chan has specified based on your input from = the initial interviews, followups and several cost reporting workshops she = has sponsored in the last month.  The pilot will be a mini-cost reporting button, using a small subset of act= ual financial data from SAP-CO (one BU, three months of data), and showing = only the cost center information (not project info).  It is designed to tes= t this solution's (Acta/Oracle/Business Objects) ability to:  1.=09extract data from SAP using Acta, 2.=09report data using a team structure, 3.=09develop usable, presentable and technically efficient ""canned reports,= "" and 4.=09provide users an ad-hoc query tool for reporting and analysis not cove= red by canned reports.  The BU reps need to become familiar with the pilot, and all of our intervie= w participants are invited to see the pilot and evaluate the tool. We'll have a questionnaire for your comments and suggestions, which we will=  incorporate into the development of the actual cost reporting button.  The= re's a distribution list at the end of this memo - if you know of someone i= n your group who should attend, please invite them.   Assuming no significant changes are identified in the user review of the p= ilot, we expect at least a portion of the cost reporting from the data ware= house to be rolled into production by the end of April.  So be sure to voic= e your input!  The second part of the warehouse will be cash reporting.  Steve Frazier is = the BU rep leading this effort, with Mike Deville from Corp Reporting and S= usan Bellinghausen from the ISC providing input.  We are working on both di= rect and indirect cash flow (historical) and trying to determine the best w= ay to source the data.  We'd like to get it from SAP since that's where we = can get the most detail, with the Treasury workstation as the source for ma= nual wires not yet input into SAP.  However, Susan's group has told us that=  the current SAP design won't allow us to use the Cash Budget Management mo= dule since that information doesn't tie to FI (due to differences in value = date and posting date).  Therefore, we're looking at what SAP design change= s might be needed.  The next step will be earnings, which will expand cost reporting by bringin= g in gross margin, other income, interest expense, minority interest and ta= xes.  We're hoping to be able to tie into the Energy Ops Project Enlighten = (data warehouse) as a source of gross margin data for wholesale operations.  We envision that the counterparty reporting button will also interface with=  other Enron warehousing efforts, such as Global Counterparty.  A significant objective of the warehouse is to provide ad hoc reporting, so=  we will be looking at the data behind the reporting buttons and determinin= g which other information should be transferred into the warehouse in the e= arly phases.  Our strategy is to place only the information that is most re= quested into the warehouse in the early phases, but to design the warehouse=  to be flexible enough to allow additional fields to be transferred in over=  time.  Budgeting and Forecasting Tool  In our interviews, many people expressed an interest in an automated planni= ng tool.  We have looked at three products - SAP's SEM, Hyperion's Planning=  and Adaytum's ePlanning. Some of you attended a demo of Adaytum last week.=  We like because it seems to have the most functionality and  two Enron BUs=  already use it (Europe and EBS).  We want to be able to plan for earnings = as well as cash forecasting and projected balance sheets, with these number= s feeding the warehouse so that our reporting could include both actuals an= d plan or forecast.  We'd like to hear any thoughts you have on how you thi= nk your BU would use a tool such as this.  We're evaluating the valuation proposition now and expect to can make a rec= ommendation at Rick's February 27 staff meeting. =20  Susan Helton and James Weitekamp are working on this effort.  Close Process  Howard Selzer is leading the initiative to shorten the close process.  He i= s gathering close calendars from each BU and is talking with each group abo= ut possible opportunities to squeeze time out of the schedule.  He will als= o focus on topside entries (after the 8th workday) to determine how to elim= inate the need for these entries.  Glenn Kobes will provide the tax perspec= tive.  Knowledge Sharing  Joe Darensbourg is preparing a plan to share best practices among groups.  = He is also spearheading the Global Accounting Intranet site, which is one o= f the media we can use.  A Web Advisory Team has been formed so that each B= U will have input into how we can best communicate using this site (still w= aiting for ETS and Europe to appoint representatives to this team).  Ideas = for knowledge sharing include soliciting tips to be reviewed by the Web Adv= isory Team and then posted to the intranet site, forming user groups in coo= peration with the ISC (ETS has groups already in place), setting up a forum=  to ask questions of other users (either as part of eThink or separately) a= nd encouraging participation in the Houston ASUG (SAP user group).  We'll w= ant to coordinate with the ISC's efforts to avoid duplication (they have FA= Qs on their web site).  Alternate Hierarchies  Caroline Lothian is working to compare and document how the each BU uses al= ternate hierarchies for reporting. This specifically addresses team reporti= ng, but also includes anything other than the legal rollup.  A common desig= n for team report hierarchies is necessary to build canned reports in the d= ata warehouse, since we expect you will want to include data at drill-down = levels such as BU, line of business, team, profit center and cost center. B= eyond a team hierarchy, we're really looking to share best practices rather=  than build a common standard.  Number of Entities and Cost Objects  Currently we have about 1,900 legal or accounting entities and nearly 200,0= 00 cost objects in SAP.  As far as we know, this is the largest number amon= g all of SAP's customers.  We want to be proactive in controlling these num= bers before they have the possibility of bringing our systems to their knee= s.  In addition, the large number of entities and cost objects result in ex= tra costs related to tax compliance and accounting maintenance, as well as = the intangible costs related to higher complexity.  Jill Erwin is heading a= n initiative to first find out how the BUs use various cost objects and whe= ther there may be a way to simplify their use, and then to identify ways to=  ensure that new entities and cost objects are set up only when that is the=  best way to accomplish Enron's objectives.  Training and Change Management  In our interviews, we heard about some problems that may be able to be reso= lved through specific training.  We will also need training on the new tool= s and initiatives that will be implemented in Project Sunrise.  It is also = important for us to continue to communicate with various accounting groups = as to what Project Sunrise is doing so that we can ensure that we provide w= hat users really need.  Madeline Chan and Dave McEllin are taking the lead = on what approach we should take on training.  We have also spoken with the = Change Management team in the ISC (under Andy Lawrence), who has agreed to = provide direction and resources as well as help ensure that together we are=  providing seamless service to our users. =20 Other Issues  Other areas that we intend to address in Project Sunrise include the automa= tion of buckets and e-schedules, balance sheets by profit center, intercomp= any issues and foreign currency issues.  In addition, we working with Susan=  Bellinghausen and Rick Boehm (ISC) to provide better reporting related to = payroll distribution and labor distribution.

The pilot will be a mini-cost reporting button, using a small subset of act= ual financial data from SAP-CO (one BU, three months of data), and showing = only the cost center information (not project info).  It is designed to tes= t this solution's (Acta/Oracle/Business Objects) ability to:  1.=09extract data from SAP using Acta, 2.=09report data using a team structure, 3.=09develop usable, presentable and technically efficient ""canned reports,= "" and 4.=09provide users an ad-hoc query tool for reporting and analysis not cove= red by canned reports.  The BU reps need to become familiar with the pilot, and all of our intervie= w participants are invited to see the pilot and evaluate the tool. We'll have a questionnaire for your comments and suggestions, which we will=  incorporate into the development of the actual cost reporting button.  The= re's a distribution list at the end of this memo - if you know of someone i= n your group who should attend, please invite them.   Assuming no significant changes are identified in the user review of the p= ilot, we expect at least a portion of the cost reporting from the data ware= house to be rolled into production by the end of April.  So be sure to voic= e your input!  The second part of the warehouse will be cash reporting.  Steve Frazier is = the BU rep leading this effort, with Mike Deville from Corp Reporting and S= usan Bellinghausen from the ISC providing input.  We are working on both di= rect and indirect cash flow (historical) and trying to determine the best w= ay to source the data.  We'd like to get it from SAP since that's where we = can get the most detail, with the Treasury workstation as the source for ma= nual wires not yet input into SAP.  However, Susan's group has told us that=  the current SAP design won't allow us to use the Cash Budget Management mo= dule since that information doesn't tie to FI (due to differences in value = date and posting date).  Therefore, we're looking at what SAP design change= s might be needed.  The next step will be earnings, which will expand cost reporting by bringin= g in gross margin, other income, interest expense, minority interest and ta= xes.  We're hoping to be able to tie into the Energy Ops Project Enlighten = (data warehouse) as a source of gross margin data for wholesale operations.  We envision that the counterparty reporting button will also interface with=  other Enron warehousing efforts, such as Global Counterparty.  A significant objective of the warehouse is to provide ad hoc reporting, so=  we will be looking at the data behind the reporting buttons and determinin= g which other information should be transferred into the warehouse in the e= arly phases.  Our strategy is to place only the information that is most re= quested into the warehouse in the early phases, but to design the warehouse=  to be flexible enough to allow additional fields to be transferred in over=  time.  Budgeting and Forecasting Tool  In our interviews, many people expressed an interest in an automated planni= ng tool.  We have looked at three products - SAP's SEM, Hyperion's Planning=  and Adaytum's ePlanning. Some of you attended a demo of Adaytum last week.=  We like because it seems to have the most functionality and  two Enron BUs=  already use it (Europe and EBS).  We want to be able to plan for earnings = as well as cash forecasting and projected balance sheets, with these number= s feeding the warehouse so that our reporting could include both actuals an= d plan or forecast.  We'd like to hear any thoughts you have on how you thi= nk your BU would use a tool such as this.  We're evaluating the valuation proposition now and expect to can make a rec= ommendation at Rick's February 27 staff meeting. =20  Susan Helton and James Weitekamp are working on this effort.  Close Process  Howard Selzer is leading the initiative to shorten the close process.  He i= s gathering close calendars from each BU and is talking with each group abo= ut possible opportunities to squeeze time out of the schedule.  He will als= o focus on topside entries (after the 8th workday) to determine how to elim= inate the need for these entries.  Glenn Kobes will provide the tax perspec= tive.  Knowledge Sharing  Joe Darensbourg is preparing a plan to share best practices among groups.  = He is also spearheading the Global Accounting Intranet site, which is one o= f the media we can use.  A Web Advisory Team has been formed so that each B= U will have input into how we can best communicate using this site (still w= aiting for ETS and Europe to appoint representatives to this team).  Ideas = for knowledge sharing include soliciting tips to be reviewed by the Web Adv= isory Team and then posted to the intranet site, forming user groups in coo= peration with the ISC (ETS has groups already in place), setting up a forum=  to ask questions of other users (either as part of eThink or separately) a= nd encouraging participation in the Houston ASUG (SAP user group).  We'll w= ant to coordinate with the ISC's efforts to avoid duplication (they have FA= Qs on their web site).  Alternate Hierarchies  Caroline Lothian is working to compare and document how the each BU uses al= ternate hierarchies for reporting. This specifically addresses team reporti= ng, but also includes anything other than the legal rollup.  A common desig= n for team report hierarchies is necessary to build canned reports in the d= ata warehouse, since we expect you will want to include data at drill-down = levels such as BU, line of business, team, profit center and cost center. B= eyond a team hierarchy, we're really looking to share best practices rather=  than build a common standard.  Number of Entities and Cost Objects  Currently we have about 1,900 legal or accounting entities and nearly 200,0= 00 cost objects in SAP.  As far as we know, this is the largest number amon= g all of SAP's customers.  We want to be proactive in controlling these num= bers before they have the possibility of bringing our systems to their knee= s.  In addition, the large number of entities and cost objects result in ex= tra costs related to tax compliance and accounting maintenance, as well as = the intangible costs related to higher complexity.  Jill Erwin is heading a= n initiative to first find out how the BUs use various cost objects and whe= ther there may be a way to simplify their use, and then to identify ways to=  ensure that new entities and cost objects are set up only when that is the=  best way to accomplish Enron's objectives.  Training and Change Management  In our interviews, we heard about some problems that may be able to be reso= lved through specific training.  We will also need training on the new tool= s and initiatives that will be implemented in Project Sunrise.  It is also = important for us to continue to communicate with various accounting groups = as to what Project Sunrise is doing so that we can ensure that we provide w= hat users really need.  Madeline Chan and Dave McEllin are taking the lead = on what approach we should take on training.  We have also spoken with the = Change Management team in the ISC (under Andy Lawrence), who has agreed to = provide direction and resources as well as help ensure that together we are=  providing seamless service to our users. =20 Other Issues  Other areas that we intend to address in Project Sunrise include the automa= tion of buckets and e-schedules, balance sheets by profit center, intercomp= any issues and foreign currency issues.  In addition, we working with Susan=  Bellinghausen and Rick Boehm (ISC) to provide better reporting related to = payroll distribution and labor distribution.  As you can see, this is a very broad project, and we want to be sure each B= U is properly represented.

Enron through a separate investment in ECOutlook in 2000 currently owns 6% of the company.  Once Enron executes the warrant we would own a total of 7% of the company.  ECOutlook's current customer list includes Bausch & Lomb, Bristol-Meyers, Ciba-Vision, BASF, Dupont, Equistar/Lyondell, Perseco(McDonalds), Sun Microsystems, SYSCO, Pentacon and others.    Enron's EDI Hub currently processes the following types of transactions:  Products     Internal C/P's External     Documents Gas 5 69 Nominations Schedule Quantities     Quick Response Capacity      Meter Statements      Imbalance              Electric 4 20 Enrollments Meter Info     Terminations Usage     Switch Notice Payments     Rate Confirmation      Invoices      Billing      Purchase Order         Financial 8 20 Checks Acknowledgements     Direct Deposits Utility Invoices     Advices Consolidated Billing     Issuances      Financial Report      Wire Transfers   The existing IP related to these types of transactions is now owned by ECPower and they will have the right to market it to other customers.    Enron has also entered into a five-year O&M agreement and will transition the operations of it's EDI Hub from ECPower to ECOutlook over the next six-months.  The O&M rates are flat to our deal with ECPower.    Enron also paid $100,000 to purchase a license to ECOutlook's B2B connectivity software called SDI Server.  We are looking at ways to use this software to assist data transformation efforts between EIM, EGM and their trading partners.

Cc: Cobb, John Subject: TW Expansion Overhead Rate Sensitivity: Confidential  For your consideration:  The proposed TW expansion is using a 2% construction overhead rate. The rate was based on an earlier analysis I did on the impact on the overhead rate at various levels of capital expenditure -using a constant 2001 TW Overhead Plan.     Rate Background The 2001 TW Overhead Plan is $1.4million, and the 2001 Capital Budget eligible for Overheads is $9.9 million, resulting in a Overhead rate of 14.1%; which has been rounded to 15% for use on TW routine capital for 2001.  The analysis that resulted in the 2% rate was based on an expansion estimate of $60 million. Holding the overhead estimate at $1.4 million, and using a revised capital budget (including a $60mm expansion estimate), resulted in total capital eligible for overheads  of approx. $70 million.  This them imputes to the 2% rate (Overheads/Capital; $1.4mm/$70mm).  Subsequently, a $90+ million expansion estimate was developed, and the above 2% rate stayed in place. With a $90 million expansion, total TW capital eligible for overheads would be approximately $100mm. Applying the 2% rate would result in imputed overheads of $1.8mm; $.4mm higher than plan, and reasonable given the magnitude of the most recent expansion estimate.  Overhead Background FYI- The level of expense charged to TW overheads in 2000 was $4 million (if applied to the above capital budget and $90 million expansion the effective rate would be 4%).  But, as stated above the 2001 Plan was $1.4 million. January and February charges to the overhead are tracking close to Plan.  FGT's incremental facilities, Phase IV ($250mm)and V($450mm) expansions are using a 3% rate.  ""Bottom Line"" - to me - an Overhead rate in the range of 2% to 4% is reasonable.

"FYI  -----Original Message----- From: Piro, Jim  Sent: Friday, August 03, 2001 5:15 PM To: Hayslett, Rod; Horton, Stanley; FOWLER, PEGGY Cc: Lobdell, Jim; Stevens, Kirk; JOHNSON, Ron W Subject: California Receivables and FERC Proceedings   The following is in answer to your question concerning our current assessment of our exposure related to the FERC proceeding looking at refunds for sales to the California PX and ISO.  This information on the FERC process was provided by Ron Johnson who is actively representing PGE in these proceedings.  For the period October  through February  we sold net power to the Cal ISO and PX  for $82 million ($93 million of sales and $11million of purchases),  of this amount approximately $34 million was for power sold under the DOE order to sell.  All sales to the Cal ISO and PX in 2001 were done under the DOE order.  To date we have received payments of $12 million which leaves a current outstanding receivable of $70 million.  Sales under the DOE order are not subject to refund in the current proceeding, however there is a possibility of a separate proceeding in the future on these transactions.  Of the $59 million of sales & $11 million of purchases that were not covered under the DOE order,  FERC will determine based upon a pricing methodology how much these amounts should be reduced by.  The reduction will be based upon the difference in the proxy price and the actual sales prices for each hour times the amount of KWH sold in that hour.  The proxy price for each hour will be determined by FERC in a proceeding that will start in about two weeks and will end with a decision sometime in late September.  The proxy price for each hour will be based on the heat rate of the marginal unit being dispatched in each hour in California times the hourly gas price for the area where the unit is located based upon a published index plus $6/MWH for O&M.   FERC will not entertain any discussions on using each company's marginal cost to determine what their proxy price should be for its specific sales.  Without the specific data on which plant was the marginal unit and what the gas price was on that hour for that unit we are not able to accurately predict what the refund amount might be.  We have made some estimates of what the refund could be given a set of assumptions on heat rate and gas prices and we think it may be in the $25 million range (high of $30 and low of $20 million).  We are continuing to work on this estimate and will have a better number next week.   In addition, FERC has stated that we will receive interest on all unpaid balances, net of the refunds, at the FERC approved interest rate which will help offset this exposure.  Since none of this forecasted exposure is for 2001 sales all of the refunds would be charged against earnings.  Refunds related to sales under the DOE order (if they occur at all) would be mostly covered under our PCA to the extent the refunds apply to sales during January or February of 2001.  We currently have reserved on our books $7 million for general credit exposure for wholesale trading and $13.4 million for the California receivables for a total pre-tax reserve of $20.4 million.  Some of this might need to stay on the books for continuing trading credit reserves but I believe we could use most of this credit reserve to offset a write down of the receivable if necessary.  In addition, we still have the outstanding issue of getting paid from the ISO and PX and the time frame for payment given the situation with PG&E and their own bankruptcy proceeding.  No assessment of this risk has been made.  FERC has also started a proceeding on potential refunds for transactions in the Northwest.  A hearing was held on August 1 and at this point there appears to be very minimal interest by most of the big northwest parties to pursue this issue (at this point only Seattle City Light, Port of Seattle and Tacoma are pursuing refunds).  The outcome of this proceeding is still unclear but there is a reasonable likelihood that this docket could be closed with no action.  We have very minimal exposure to Seattle and Tacoma probably less than $2 million.  The discussion above does not include the receivable from SCE for the terminated power contract.   They are current on their payments of $2.667 million per month and the amount remaining due is $42.7 million.  We will provide you an additional update as we get more information from FERC on the proxy price.",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,FW: California Receivables and FERC Proceedings,2001-08-08 05:01:25-07:00,received

More specifically, I laid out a plan as to how we might cover our current overview gap of $19.5m (IBIT) from where our latest forecast came out.  As you will see, several of these items will need to get AA&Co buy-in (items noted as either Accouting Changes or Changes in Management Position).  I think we have a good case for all of these, but we still need to go through the process with them at the appropriate time.  In addition, I've note ""Other Risks/Opportunities"" for the quarter that could have significant impacts on our ultimate results.  We will keep an eye on these and manage them as appropriate.

"Tracy  For VP level & above, I had the team pull by individual a recap of payroll information from SAP.  This extract shows all the ""current""  payroll buckets that contain some type of reportable compensation.  We then took that information & broke it into ""fixed "" and ""variable"" pay components.  The attached spreadsheet provides you an individual/job group summary for the ""fixed"" vs. ""variable"" pay components on a consolidated basis.   The ""variable"" pay amounts include ad-hoc payments for options, annual/retention bonus payments, tax settlements/refunds, etc.  Based on our conversation, my sense is that for budgeting purposes, you will need to utilize the ""fixed"" total amounts.  PLEASE NOTE - while the ""fixed"" pay components have been annualized, the ""variable"" pay components represent only those amounts recorded in the payroll system to date.  Also, I understand there may be changes to the flex dollar amounts - but I do not yet know the details.  I've checked with Executive Compensation to determine whether there might be a change in the Flexperq amounts - am still waiting for input.  I will advise you of any changes I hear with regard to these elements.   Additionally, on the fixed side, you should also budget some merit dollars - I would suggest 4-5%.  We do not know the amount yet - but I think that should be consistent with past practice.   Tracy - if you need anything else, please let me know.

Which line do I use?  The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Column A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there could be $11K/month going forward.   The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP.

  Attached is a file showing depreciation for NNG Commercial after excluding depreciation for the capital dollars associated with rate case settlement (lines 13-16).  The 2002 depreciation is calculated to be $4.379 million.    I think philosophically it s a good idea to track capital projects within NNG Commercial based on the life of the contracts used to justify the project.  I don't think Neubauer is quite there yet.    My concern is that we have developed an IBIT  target for 2002 by using a 2001 number that does not include depreciation.  It seems that we ought to offset the 01 starting point by the amount of the 02 depreciation.

I have yet another request for which I need your input.  Causey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s).    What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey.  For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments.  It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world).  I say ""department"" because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc.  If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss.  The data needs to be as recent as possible.  Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1.  If you have more recent data, that would be great.

Then, we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough, and,                we'll be more content when they are.                 After that, we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with.                We will, certainly, be happy when they are out of that stage.                 We tell ourselves that our life will be complete, when our spouse                gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, we are able                to go on a nice vacation, or, when we retire.                 The truth is, there's no better time to be happy, than right now.                If not now, when?                 Your life will, always, be filled with challenges.                It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy, anyway.                Happiness is the way.                 So, treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more, because                you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time                with... and, remember, that time waits for no one.                 So, stop waiting....                 - until your car or home is paid off                - until you get a new car or home                - until your kids leave the house                - until you go back to school                - until you finish school                - until you lose 10 pounds                - until you gain 10 pounds                - until you get married                - until you get a divorce                - until you have kids                - until you retire                - until summer                - until spring                - until winter                - until fall                - until you die                 There is no better time, than right now, to be happy.

"    Media Relations Contact: Gina Taylor (713) 853-7681 Investor Relations Contact: Gay Mayeux (713) 853-9905  EOTT ENERGY ANNOUNCES RECAPITALIZATION PLAN   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Friday, Sept. 7, 2001  HOUSTON - EOTT Energy Partners, L. P. (EOTT) announced today a recapitalization plan which includes the conversion of all outstanding subordinated units and additional partnership interests (APIs) into common units and the implementation of a refinancing plan.   Upon successful completion of the plan, the board of directors of its general partner, EOTT Energy Corp., intends to increase the annual cash distribution on common units from $1.90 to $1.95.   Elements of the plan require unitholder approval, which will be sought later this year. ""We believe that the plan enhances the value of EOTT's common units and places our common unitholders in a position to realize immediate benefit from increases in the partnership's available cash,"" said Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of EOTT.  Conversion of Subordinated Units into Common Units A key component of the plan is the conversion of all subordinated units to common units.  Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) and Koch Petroleum Group, L.P. (Koch) have agreed to convert all 9.0 million outstanding subordinated units and $9.3 million of APIs into approximately  4.3 million common units.  These changes in capital structure are expected to enhance EOTT's ability to increase cash distributions to its common unitholders.  An amendment to the partnership agreement will be required to affect this conversion.    Financings  As part of its recapitalization plan, EOTT intends to affect equity and long-term debt offerings to refinance short-term debt incurred in connection with its $117 million asset acquisition completed in June 2001.  It also intends to replace its existing working capital credit facility with a new facility with lending institutions.  An amendment to the partnership agreement is not required for the financings, which are anticipated to be completed by year-end.  Unitholder Approval and Proxy  The amendment to the partnership agreement must be approved by a favorable vote of holders of at least two-thirds of each of the outstanding common units and subordinated units.  Additional details regarding the recapitalization will be included in proxy materials to be mailed to unitholders this fall. Lehman Brothers acted as sole financial advisor to EOTT on the recapitalization. EOTT Energy Partners, L. P. is a major independent marketer and transporter of crude oil in North America.  EOTT transports most of the lease crude oil it purchases via pipeline, which includes 8,200 miles of EOTT's intrastate and interstate pipeline and gathering systems, and a fleet of 285 owned or leased trucks.  In addition, EOTT owns and operates a hydrocarbon processing plant; a natural gas liquids storage facility; and a liquid pipeline grid system.  EOTT Energy Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp., is the general partner of EOTT Energy Partners, L.P. with headquarters in Houston, Texas.  EOTT's Internet address is www.eott.com . The partnership's common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""EOT.""

This press release does not constitute an offer of any security, and any such offer must be made only by means of a prospectus.

It includes the Income Statement, Indirect Cash Flow Statement, and numerous supplemental schedules.    As discussed previously, this template requires more detail compared to what has been required in past years.  Some of the detail sheets are linked to certain lines on the summary sheets, so if you encounter an error message regarding a cell being locked, it will be because there is a more detailed sheet for input for that particular item.  Some sheets include check figures, so please make sure these are all reconciled before submitting the file.  A few reminders: 1. Please do not add any lines or alter in any way the 'Format' or 'PRMA' worksheets. 2. Please round all amounts to one decimal place, even within the cell (for example, don't have a cell show 45.2 and have 45.24395135 as the actual number in the cell). 3. Please do not include any embedded links in the file you submit.  With regard to Operating Expenses, there is an SAP Cost Element Mapping worksheet included to assist you in determining where expenses are mapped.  Also, please note that the due date for this file is THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4.  If you have any questions, please contact me (income) or Greg Adams (cash flow).

There will be standard reports for each of those new content areas.  Be sure your BU is well represented in the training scheduled for the last 2 weeks of October!  Following the September 30 rollouts, we will have all of our originally planned content in the data warehouse, so we will be concentrating on increasing usage.  We have been presenting roadshows (demos that come to you), which we plan to expand.  In addition, we will be identifying power users in your group who will be experts at both SAP reporting and Business Objects reporting from the data warehouse, so they can advise others as to the best option for a specific reporting need.  Let me know who you'd like us to work with in your group.  The Adaytum planning model is nearly completed.  We are working with Steve Schwarzbach and Greg Adams to ensure that any changes to their excel templates will be incorporated into the model.  We will be running parallel for the 2002 Plan process that is due October 4 - excel templates will be turned in at that time, and the Adaytum model will be completed and reconciled back to the excel results shortly after that.

Review   Rod, please forward this note to Mark Lindsey ASAP (I can't find his name on our email address book and I've had trouble with sending him things in the past).    Attached is a file that includes unusual accounting adjustments and/or implementation adjustments we're proposing as a result of our new rate case order.  These adjustments total $31.3m (IBIT), and $29.8m (Net Income for Q3 2001.  Forecasted results for Q3 we've been sending to you (including our 3rd Current Estimate) include these adjustments.   Accordingly, not getting AA&Co concurence on any of these issues will have a negative impact on PGG's Q3 results.   For entries affecting PGH & PVC (see tab), we need to make sure Enron Corp is supportive of our treatment.  This is because although AA&Co. Portland will be reviewing our records and our reasons for the adjustments, they will likely pass on the AA&Co. Houston any of these items they may question.  This is because their primary focus is PGE earnings, not PVC or PGH since we don't report these companies out any place publicly on a stand-alone basis.  We've passed along the Merger MOU proposal to AA&Co. Portland already since it has ties to our rate order (and they're thinking about it), but we're waiting to hear back from you that the other three items on the list are support by you, then we'll pass them on to AA&Co Portland for review.  Please respond back by next Monday, Sept 24th to allow us appropriate time to get them reviewed by AA&Co.   All the items on the PGE tab have been explained to AA&Co. Portland, and we're hoping to get their position on these adjustments by next Monday, Sept 24.  We feel we have good justification for all the adjustments, but some are more of a stretch than others (when projecting whether or not AA&Co will approve them).  Please call if you have any questions.  thanks",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,FW: Q3 Adjustments - AA&Co. Review,2001-09-19 08:11:07-07:00,received

"Tracy, our current forecast includes a gross bonus accrual of $13m for the full year (Note that a portion of this amount is capitalize through our labor loading process - about 33%).  This is significantly below our target level for the year ($16.5m) and last year's actual payout of $16.7m.  We reduced these amounts based on our lower that expected performance in Q3 that we've been discussing.  Early this year we we're accruing at a maximum amount of $17.6 since our forecasts looked better at the time. Here' s the layout of how this falls by quarter in the forecast: Q1 - $4.4 Q2 - $4.4 Q3 - $1.0 (forecast) Q4 - $3.2 (forecast)        $13.0  Based on how Q4 results look, we will reassess our accrual levels at that time.

"FYI  -----Original Message----- From: Stevens, Kirk  Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 11:46 AM To: Mayeux, Gay Cc: Hayslett, Rod Subject: RE: PGE Power Costs   Gay, here's the story and some numbers for the Q3 comparison.  Please remember the context of our phone conversion this morning when looking at this.  Hopefully this helps Investor Relations put the story together for the Earnings Release.  Power Cost Adjustment  We now expect to have an amount collectable from customers to record all Q3 of $86m.  Since we we're basically at the deadband level at the end of Q2, we end up eating our way through the deadband and up into the 90% collection band all in Q3.  On a stand alone basis, we will incur  about $54m of net variable power costs Q3 that we won't have any revenues for (but remember to keep this in context for the entire 9-month period).  The following shows how this is calculated:  Projected Net Variable Power Costs = $316m Baseline for PCA = $176m Difference Subject to PCA Collection = $140  Deadband  = $35m  (no collection) 50/50 band = $21m (collect $10.5m, no collection = $10.5) 90/10 band = $84m (collect $75.5m, no collection = $8.5)  The bands above = $140m ($35+21+84) Collections = $86m ($10.5+75.5) No Collection (PGE eats) = $54m ($35+10.5+8.5)  Again, without the PCA mechanism and no other price increase between 1/1/01 and 9/30/01, PGE would be $90m worse off.  As we discussed, before pulling our request for a rate increase to be effective 1/1/01 (which was replaced with the PCA mechanism), the latest amount being offered up by our PUC would have been around a $90m increase for the 9-month period (although the evidence was quickly moving towards no need for an increase, so we probably wouldn't have got the rate increase, and without a PCA, would have been worse off today).    Quarter to Quarter Comparison - Margins As we discussed, things were looking really good for us through Q2 2001, but price caps and other factors in late Q2/early Q3 really dropped the price we could sell our excess power for, and accordingly has dropped our margins.  In addition, a slowing economy and customer energy efficiency measures have resulted in significant reductions in our retail revenues compared to last year.    Another point on the this year/last year quarter to quarter comparisons is that we went into Q3 2000 with length purchased at fairly low/reasonable costs over the prior year or so.  In Q3 2000, wholesale sales prices increased dramatically (California market) so we made tremendous margins (above normal).  Going into Q3 2001, much of the power we purchased was at higher prices than the previous year because of the higher wholesale power market operating over the past year.  When price caps and other events dropped the bottom out of the wholesale power prices, our margins on our power lenght dropped dramatically.  The PCA only picks up a power of this increase in net variable power costs, as outlined above.  Also remember that we have a regulatory obligation to serve our customers, so we have to go into a month with length in order to ensure we can handle any potential load spikes or unplanned plant outages.  Any excess power is sold in the wholesale market in the day-ahead or real-time markets.    Big story, price caps and lower retail revenues have really hurt us year to year, but our new rate case effective 10/1/01 should get us back on track.   Gross Margin Comparisons Based on our latest forecast, here's a breakdown of our gross margins on a year to year comparison for Q3.  This gives you a high level look at the impact the above events have had on our margins year to year ($94m decrease in gross margin).

The last point is the most important, so we can blow through the preliminaries as fast (or slow) as is appropriate.      1.  Current Status of Proceeding  --Briefing is complete  --minor skirmishing on page limit and Staff motion to strike still going on (argument set for 9-28)    --ALJ decision still expected on or around 10-15  2.  Primary Issues  --TW's tariff and posting procedures are confusing, complex, inconsistent, and allow TW too much discretion  --TW gave Sempra and Richardson unfair advance notice of the capacity availability (preposting conversations)   --TW withheld operational capacity and agreed to make it available only to shippers who agreed to favorable deals with TW  --TW offered negotiated terms and conditions in exchange for the shippers' agreement to pay high rates    --The Sempra and Richardson deals are irrational and must have been the product of market power or unfairness  3.  The Political Climate  --FERC is now coming after PG&E GT NW, on facts that look worse than ours (customers claim they weren't offered the recourse rate).   That case is set for hearing with a decision within 120 days.  Staff raised one new issue:  misuse of alternate delivery point rights.     --Prices continue to abate, with some in California declaring the energy crisis over    4. Likely Litigation Outcome  --Little or no chance of a complete win  --No party proposed refunds or unwinding of the deals as a remedy, but ALJ could recommend it  --No party proposed elimination of TW's negotiated rate authority, but ALJ could recommend it  --Some additional changes in tariff and posting procedures almost certain     --ALJ likely to defer difficult decisions on refunds and negotiated rate policy to the Commission   5.  Settlement Recommendation  --Staff has initiated discussions; ball is in our court to make a specific proposal  --Recommend proposal to Staff that includes some or all of the following points:   *limited moratorium for next heating season on additional index-index contracts on operational capacity    *future operational capacity sales all done through interactive open season   *new posting and capacity allocation procedures in the tariff, with most discretion eliminated     *TW makes many of the tariff and posting changes advocated by Indicated Shippers (i.e., pro rata allocation)    *TW offers to upgrade the EBB to a ""fully interactive, next generation EBB"" as soon as operationally feasible   --TW and Staff will try to get all interested parties on board after general framework nailed down.

The analysis reflects a $305 million charge, or $294 million after tax.  We have assumed asset values that we would place at the 90% confidence level.  These numbers are slightly higher than you saw before as a result of (1)  our taking a 90% confidence level approach and (2) further analysis on Lurgi which reflects an impairment based upon a controlled shut-down alternative rather than a sale.  The numbers also include our recent litigation settlement, Azurix Corp severances, and Azurix Corp PP&E impairments.  We would be available at any time to discuss this analysis with you.  Since AA has not reviewed any of this information, the next step is to get AA to confirm the analysis and numbers.  We will wait on your approval to take this step.

The contractual obligation to pay UCU $1.2 million for 2001 can be offset by a $.7million ""credit"" for value given to UCU by NNG Marketing during the year. Thus the amount to be paid to UCU in October would be $.5 million.   ? The Third Current Estimate now assumes a $.6 million payment..  Reserves are not needed to meet Third Current Estimate. ? UCU has expressed an interest in banking the $.7million credit from 2001 to 2002   Recommendation: ? Defer $.7 million 2001 credit to 2002 - (negotiate time value appropriately) ? Pay $1.2 million in October 2001(4th quarter) ? Reverse $1.0 reserve in September (3rd quarter), as it is not longer needed to meet Third Current Estimate. ?

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from ENW for your business unit.  This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""5xxxxxxx"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.  If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.  If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

"Tracy,   Only the Ad Val and Tax Compliance groups intend to charge clean fuels.  If Methanol is the only thing left and it is Corporate, then the charges would stay on the Corp. tax cost centers instead of being charged to ETS.  Thanks for your information.

"Per your request we have checked the MMF calculation data for NNG/TW/FGT/Trailblazer to Hyperion and/or SAP as appropriate.  Data checks out. However, I asked Mary to provide me a copy of the prior year calculation.  It appears that the NNG and TW Fair Value Adjustment companies were included in the calculation this year, but were excluded last year.  A ballpark estimate is that the ETS MMF factor would drop by .1% if the NNG/TW fair value companies were excluded as they were last year.   That would mean a factor of 19.0% rather than 19.1%.

"FYI  -----Original Message----- From: Stevens, Kirk  Sent: Monday, October 01, 2001 2:45 PM To: Butts, Bob; Hayslett, Rod Cc: Piro, Jim Subject: PGG Q3 Forecast - Confidential    Quick update on our Q3 earnings (still very prelim).  3rd Current Estimate:        IBIT = (2.7)        NI    = (1.3)  Latest Forecast:        IBIT = (9.1)        NI   = 1.7  Major variance - TOLI loss for the month is expected to be $9.5m, or $6.5m worse than our 3rd Current Estimate.  The recent sharp decline in the stock market is the driver (post Sept 11 market impact). Without the additional TOLI loss, we'd be right on our 3rd Current Estimate.  Major Risks - AA&Co. Issues The following issues are currently being reviewed and challenged (to different degrees) by AA&Co Portland (note- Houston AA&Co - Duncan -has been updated on these items by Tim McCann - AA&Co Portland).  Our forecast numbers above assume positive outcome on all these issues.  We will continue to hold our ground, feeling our positions are appropriate.  But since several of these have no direct impact on PGE stand-alone reporting, Houston (you) have better leverage getting these through the AA&Co staff in Houston that may question our treatment.  TOLI Deferred Tax Reserve - $9m PGE proposes to reverse this reserve established Q4 1999 (at the date of the Sierra Sale announcement) since the deal with Sierra was terminated, and since we now feel recording this type of reserve is more appropriate at the time of an actual transfer of the TOLI assets to Enron under any future sale of PGE.  AA&Co is fighting this one hard, Greek Rice has been made aware of this.  Pension Credit Capitalization - $5m (YTD 9/30 true-up) PGE proposes that we no longer capitalize our FAS 87 pension credit since our rates assume zero pension costs for ratemaking purposes.  AA&Co. is using a FAS 87 implementation issue to say we still need to capitalize the credit, and possibly set up a FAS 71 reg asset (although they're still somewhat pushing no change to our current accounting, ie just keep capitalizing the pension credit).  Merger MOU Obligation - PVC - $5.7m Since our new ratecase allows recovery of the remaining costs for this committment made as part of the Enron purchase of PGE, we believe the remaining liability set up in purchase accounting on PVC's books can be reversed.  AA&Co. feels we still have an obligation to perform the MOU committments (which we do), but we feel that our original estimate of this cost at the time of the PGE/Enron merger has now been reduced as a result of the ratemaking treatment, so it should be reduced to zero.  AA&Co. prefers that we bring the liability down over time as we fullfill the committment, letting earnings effect come in over time.  Severance Reserves - PGH1 ($2.7m) and PVC ($3.5m) At the time of the Enron purchase of PGE, severance reserves were set up for an anticipate number of involuntary terminations expected to occur within the first few years of the merger.  Over time, actual severance payments made to PGH or PGE employees have been reversed out of these reserves.  At this point, no future terminations are contemplated which relate to the initial merger conditions/environment.  Accordingly we plan to reverse these balances to income Q3.    At this point, AA&Co. thinks we should consider taking these back against goodwill (which we feel goes against Purchase Accounting guidance).    Litigation Reserve - PGH1 ($2.1m) PGC and it's subsidiaries had numerous legal issues outstanding at the merger date (eg. Columbia Steel, Trojan Recovery, City of Burbank Contract, Bonneville Pacific).   A reserve of $5 million was established in purchase accounting for any legal/litigation and settlement costs incurred by PGC and subsidiaries to defend itself in these types of claims/proceedings.  The reserve also was to cover any litigation filed post merger directly related to the merger.  Since the merger date, we have reversed actual costs incurred for these types of activities in the amount of $2.9 million, leaving a remaining reserve balance at 9/30/01 of $2.1 million.  At this time, all legal claims outstanding at the merger date have been settled satisfactorily where no material contingency exists.    Accordingly, we will reverse the remaining balance in Q3 2001.  Again, AA&Co has indicated that we had over estimated the original cost of these activities in purchase accounting, and that we should now reverse the difference back through goodwill (again, we think this is a misapplication of purchase accounting since we are well outside the orginal 1-2 year window for adjusting goodwill).   There are a few other items we're debating with AA&Co (in the range of $4m to 6m), and I'll let you know if any of these start to look at risk.    Let me know if you have any questions on these items (503) 464-7121.",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,FW: PGG Q3 Forecast - Confidential,2001-10-01 15:15:22-07:00,received

I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.  To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).  What we are asking you to do is as follows:  1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).  2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.  3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).    Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

"Tracy, I talked to the Colorado Sales and Use Tax auditor today.  The auditor will submit two assessments:  Assets and Compressor Fuel.    Compressor fuel will be assessed, but I believe the following are plausible arguments that might succeed and favorably adjust the estimated $350,000 liability (Plus Penalty & Interest):   (2)(b)(ii)  ""Purchase Price"" should be adjusted to reflect TWP as a market maker, that could purchase natural gas    lower than market could supply and transportation in San Juan Index    (Price should be $1.80 / MMBTU down from Avg $1.90/ MMBTU)     (b)(iii) The correct tax rate would be 3%, not 5%, local tax should not be applicable.  Formal research is required.   Assuming $1.80/MMBTU, the original estimate ($350k) might be adjusted down to $231,218.46, or as low as $138,731.08, as follows:       2,569,094  Consumption  MMBTU       $  1.80  Price / MMBTU       $4,624,369.20  Purchase      $92,487.38  Local Tax         $138,731.08  State Tax         $231,218.46  Total Tax  Please call if you would like to meet and discuss this issue.    Dan Rittgers Ext 35734    -----Original Message----- From: Rittgers, Dan  Sent: Monday, October 01, 2001 12:21 PM To: Geaccone, Tracy Cc: Hrna, Sandra Subject: FW: Transwestern pipeline Colorado Audit FEIN 74-1294795 (Account L80-30571)     Tracy, I called the auditor last week, following our conversation.  The auditor has not returned my call.  Field work is complete and no formal assessment has been issued.  I have unresolved issues which the auditor must consider before issuing the assessment. In Summarizing our conversation last week:  1)  I have not seen a preliminary assessment, which I hoped would be coming in October. 2)  During the auditor's field audit, the auditor proposed to assess tax on the following issues:     a)  Assets Purchase $500,000 in Tax, Penalty & Interest.  I might protest almost all assessed     amounts for this category.     b)  Expenses (Compressor Fuel) Estimate $350,000 for audit Period.  Issues not resolved:    i)    My position is that no tax is due, except for domestic fuel consumption.    ii)   If ""Compressor Fuel"" is taxable, what is the ""Purchase Price"".    iii)  Is the 2% local tax applicable to ""Compressor Fuel""?    iv)   Should tax be calculated prospectively, rather than retroactively?    v)    If assessed, Transwestern requests that the current regulation be revised to      reflect a change for this issue (Tariff may accommodate a pass through without     a rate case?).  I will provide a copy of the assessment for your records and subsequent consideration, when available.  The auditor was promoted during my audit and is transition.

Which line do I use? The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Column A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there could be $11K/month going forward.  The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP.  Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant.   If you need more specificity, I suggest you give Dan a call.   -----Original Message----- From: Chandler, Bob  Sent: Tuesday, August 28, 2001 9:52 AM To: Geaccone, Tracy Cc: Zahn, Gary Subject: RE: Transwestern pipeline Colorado Audit FEIN 74-1294795  (Account L80-30571) Tour, Status and Protest (COMPRESSOR FUEL)   I'm sure Jerry is aware of this.

Subject: REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority  Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.  To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).  What we are asking you to do is as follows:  1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).  2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.  3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).    Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.  If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.  And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Subject: REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority  Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.  To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).  What we are asking you to do is as follows:  1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).  2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.  3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).    Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.  If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.  And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

As in the case of NNG & TW, income and asset cost are increasing. Therefore, property taxes also will increase.  In order to keep the property tax liability flat, three strategies are available (1) book any gain on the sale of an asset below the line (N.U.O.I.), (2) assets there are no longer in service should be retired from the books of records, and (3) items that can be expensed should be expensed and not capitalized to plant, property, & equipment.

Please provide the IBIT variance explanation for 3CE vs 2CE in the sheet named ""Var Expl 3CE vs 2CE"" for your project.  Just a few friendly reminders,  1. Please tie out August actuals to Hyperion by September 26 and drop in September flash in the 3rd CE file. The tentative due date for September flash is Friday, October 5th. Please do not change September final flash numbers while you work on the 3rd CE.   2. Please do not change the plan numbers.  3. These files are linked to the consolidation file.

"Tracy, There is no detail of the O&M expense as has been requested.  I read Valerie's note about how they're not geared toward providing that because of their FERC COA vs. SAP.  The allocations page possibly, but they will likely need to provide their best estimate of all of the O&M detail.  However, given that their sale is pending, I don't know what level of scrutiny will be afforded to PGE's costs.  I will check with Lindsey, Butts, et.al. to see.  Also, their file is linked to all of their source files.  This is unacceptable - this exposes our model to linking complications (their file opens up with a manual calculation required to update the numbers) and causes rounding errors.  Please have them enter in their numbers as requested initially: $ in millions, to one decimal point in the cell (for example, a cell may reflect 4.5, but the cell actually contains 4.5211114598793546 because of the links --- we need the cell to reflect and contain just 4.5 .)

Facility modifications   $1,665,000   Cleaning & application      $165,000   Re-application every 6 months     $165,000   The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.  For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.  Please let me know of anything else you need.

Cc: Hayslett, Rod Subject: RE: EGAS 4th Qtr   I think you may be reading more into this than was meant by the memo.  There are alot of business entities that roll-up into EGS.  There usually is some flexibility in each business unit regarding their quarterly numbers.  By having all the facts we as a team can present them to Causey.  We may very well be able to accelerate earnings in one group for a quarter to make up deficiencies in another group.  It would be nice to be able to discuss these options as a unit before reporting them to corporate.  No one is trying to manage anything other than to give Rick a complete assessment as to what EGS results look like and the fexibility we have as a unit.  This is all Tracy was trying to convey.  No one has asked that you not respond to corporate only that we have a chance to see what our numbers look like as an entity before releasing to corporate.  I don't think Rick has any problem with this but I will ask Rod by this memo to check with Rick to see if he does.   I think this is pretty consistent with the way wholesale and retail report to corporate.   Thanks.  -----Original Message----- From: Hughes, James A.

The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the 1995 Global Settlement.  SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001.  In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:  1. SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during the Global Settlement.    2. The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement.    3. Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on the commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed.      4. SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transwestern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the tariff, Transwestern.  5. If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the complaint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a six-month period.  6. SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward for the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.  In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Transwestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR.  Accordingly, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore possible ADR procedures.  We will advise as new developments warrant.  In the meantime, should you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me at (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,FW: SoCalGas Complaint (Message from Greg Porter),2001-10-23 05:20:29-07:00,received
" Tracy:  I'm back!  I enjoyed my long weekend.  My 20th anniversary with Enron is today. (I started at a very young age!)   I have already selected my gift and you should be receiving it soon.  It will probably come in a box because I ordered a matching necklace and bracelet.   There are not many days remaining in 2001 and I need to take some vacation days because I have quite a few days left to take.  I have looked at the calendar and hopefully chosen days that will have the least amount of impact on everyone.  Anyway, this is what I came up with:  November 1 November 9 November 19-21 (Thanksgiving week)  I had already made plans to visit my family in Kansas for Thanksgiving            before Palu left.  I spoke with Jeanette and she has agreed to do the             weekly on that Tuesday before Thanksgiving, if we do a weekly that week.            I don't think we did a weekly last year due to the 3 day work week. December 7 December 17 December 21 December 31   I also plan on carrying over 1 week.  Let me know if you have a problem with any of these dates.  Jan",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,jan.moore@enron.com,20th Anniversary w/ Enron & Remaining 2001 Vacation,2001-10-23 10:56:08-07:00,received

The amount is simply a guideline and charges will only be incurred if you use eSource in 2002.  The additional amount for IT Infrastructure relates to a passthrough to Other Business Units of Infrastructure charges allocated to ENA from ENW.  The basis for this is a calculation of FTE's based on 2002 Planned allocations from ENA support departments to your business unit.  You are then charged a % of that support department's Infrastructure charges applicable to the FTE's.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.

We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.    This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""52502000"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.  If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.  If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

"Tracy,  I'm sure you have no time for this now, but I wanted to get this information to you as soon as I had it.  I am very concerned to learn that only a part (approximately 1/3 or $680,000) was allocated out to EGS units as part of Steve Kean's budget.  (A disproportionately high $600,000 was allocated to EGM and the remaining $738,000 was retained at corp.)  It is my understanding that $470,000 was budgeted for the ETS communications group.    Recognizing that my proposed corp. budget already reflected a decrease of approximately $ 1 million from the 2001 budget and $5 million from its 2000 budgets, it will be tight, but we could do our work as an EGS group if we were able to get the EGS allocations ($680,000), ETS communications budget ($470,000) and the portion that was unallocated corp. ($738,000), for a total of $1,888,000.    I presume the problem with this is that it includes $738,000, which was not allocated to EGS entities.  Do you think this can be accommodated or should we look at keeping the budget at corp., with a reporting line to Stan?  (I have not broached this with Stan.)  I've attached spreadsheets with my corp. budget and Gina Taylor's ETS budget.  When you have time, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you.

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.

"Hello Tracy,  I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics and Hoang this week related to the project.  On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources.  I know that you guys have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very difficult to get the required information or time from the resources that are committed to the project.  This is due to the fact that they currently have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the project.  It is having an impact on the timeline.  The home office model could be a lot further along if some of the required information was delivered as requested.  Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.  It is important that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it will become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.  We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full production.  This individual should be identified and running the administration duties as soon as possible.  My fear is that without proper ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in the short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.  We've had some technical issues with the production and development environment.  Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an impact on the timeline.  There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly articulated and it has resulted in the redesign of the model.  Much time has been spent on gathering business process information from various people which has caused a delay in the model development.  I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks, and result in a successful implementation.

Gray indicated the following:  * Aviation budget number look comparable to operator standards (approx. $1,900 / hour, 600 hour estimate) * The plane has a market value of $1.8 - $2.0 million and a book value of $2.2 million * Turbo prop charters for trips to Tehachapi would run in excess of $1,100 / hour and may be limited as there are only two qualified operators * The Cessna is the only jet suitable for use to Tehachapi based on runway length and altitude * Gary will make a site visit before the end of the year  Assuming that of the budgeted 600 hours of operation, only 400 hours would require charter, the cost of charter would approach $0.5 million of the total budget of $1.2 million.  This plus the flexibility of using the plan on longer hauls (e.g., to Houston) make it economically justified.  My recommendation is that based on the current situation, we retain the aircraft.

With regard to users loosing Contributor data previously entered, we believe they may not be waiting long enough after selecting Save, and closing the window before the save process is complete.  This afternoon Pat sent the detailed instructions below, stressing that users wait until they receive the Done message before closing the window.  She has asked users to let her know if they continue to have this problem.  Due to the size of our applications they do take several minutes to open and may take longer to save.  The second issue involves salary calculations in the base models in Adaytum Analyst.  Last week we corrected a formula to resolve this problem.  As it turns out the  changes made in Analyst last week are not there now.  Hoang Vo, who is in Omaha today, asked one of his Adaytum collogues, who is working on the Corporate project, to look into this.  He contacted Pat and indicated he had experienced this same problem and supplied her with a macro to run after making the changes in Analyst.  Pat updated several applications this evening and will check in the morning to see if it worked.  This issue with saving in Analyst is not related to the saving issue in Contributor.  Additionally, Contributor has not been available for several days recently.  This is due to problems with the server that is operated by Networks.  Hoang has worked with the Sunrise technical lead and Networks, and this problem is resolved.   If there any questions, please don't hesitate to call me or Pat.

"Tracy,  Over the past few months, Rositza has been researching where the rebates related to Operations have been booked because Phil had earmarked them specifically to assist us in achieving our stretch target.  The rebates are not hitting Operations cost centers, and for numerous reasons from Accounting, they cannot be reclassified into the Operations hierarchies.  Since the rebates received are outside of Operations and Phil should get credit for them, I am reducing our stretch for the upcoming forecast for the rebates actually recorded through September and those expected for Q4.  This is a total of $1.0MM.  If you need documentation, I can forward Rositza's research to you.  Let me know if you have questions.  The ""ETS"" forecast we will submit for Operations will only include what will show up in that column for actuals at year end.  It includes our IBIT estimate for co.'s 1202, 184, 42P, 1195.  Any other amounts we have carried there in previous forecasts will be moved to the pipeline where we expect to see the actuals.  This forecast should represent our best estimate of where we will actually end up for the year (as of today!).  We continue to monitor spending closely, and will adjust next month if necessary.

Because of this the EST IT group is now exploring solutions that will achieve what is needed.  Considering we thought this was being worked on by Sunrise, until a few weeks ago, we have a great deal more work ahead of us than earlier expected.  In Operations we will need Hoang Vo working on our project until the end of April 2002 at a minimum.  He is currently scheduled to roll of the project at the end of January.  We need to get with Adaytum and reserve this additional time.  Do you want to do that or would you rather to go ahead and work with Fred Ali to make the arrangements.

I have also verified that number with Robert Miller and he agrees that is the number reflected on the Income Statement.

It is poss= ible they will ask for additional information. =20 =20 Nicaragua:  Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6= .3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to swee= p the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped b= y the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project).  Partners to re= imburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron's ultimate outflow will=  be approximately $2.2 million.  Team tried to get MARAD to agree to altern= ative solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and pol= itical implications. =20 Panama:  Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elekt= ra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama).  Three issues are wor= th noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) wi= ll likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can't get bid bonds on its o= wn although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM's mar= ginal costs are among highest in Panama.  A preliminary strategy has been m= apped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit ""one-sided"" in favor of the distri= butor.  BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the = distco to change terms without success. =20 =20 Dominican Republic:  El Paso confirmed it can't work with us.  Operationall= y, the plant is working well.  As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI's fuel su= pplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.=   Enron rejected the request.  SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol.  We = are working closely with Tom Moran of ENE credit on these issues. =20 Ecoelectrica: This week was a very productive week.  Update as follows:  Lender Process: =  Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they underst= and that Mirant's insurance package is the result of market conditions.  Le= nders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 millio= n coverage.  Mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles.  Lend= ers appear content with that option.  ENE insurance has approximately 75% o= f the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional=  $200 million tranche.  Backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kic= k back existing coverage.  Mirant to issue a certification of compliance wi= th QF (by Eco) and a legal opinion asap.  Based on the progress this week a= nd the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender= 's agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the le= nder group by Tuesday of next week.  Finally, Mirant also committed to prov= iding comments (if any) to the Lender Consent Agreement.  ENE and EME have = reviewed and provided comments already.  GE Consent:  Mirant committed to s= ending their ""versions"" of the key documents on the GE buy-out on Friday ni= te (late).  I have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated th= at the documents are ""conforming"".  Union Carbide Guarantee:  Plan to final= ize language early next week.  Schedule:  Mirant has committed to fulfillin= g CP's as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we=  can allow them to fund on 12/19.  They state they are confident they can c= lose CP's by earlier than 12/14 and can fund on 12/19.  CSFB has not shed l= ight on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investi= gate further. =20 =20 APACHI =20 =20 Philippines: The team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and neg= otiations with NPC but was unable to move the slow government machinery fas= t enough to make it to a signing by last Thursday's New York event.  Nevert= heless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12/15 agreemen= t date; funding wouldn't occur until early next year.=20 =20 Guam:  Continue discussions with Mirant and AES with a focus on getting the= m over the hump on the issue of Enron's contingent obligation to cover the = potential shortfall under a GPA buy-out event.  Work continues.  Meetings h= ave been set with Dr. Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project. = =20 =20 China:  Unit 2 still scheduled to come back on line on 11/23.  Two likely c= auses still under investigation (poor vaccum or material design flaw).  Wor= k on capital reduction for Chengdu on hold until discussions are held with = Houston to ensure consensus.  In the mean time, several parties have approa= ched us with interest in Chengdu.  On Hainan, team is paying several visits=  to the new SAFE representatives, first to work on the mid November repayme= nt ($10 million).   Next step would be liquidation. =20 =20 Europe =20 =20 Gaza:  Waiting to hear from CCC (partner) on conceptual proposal: ENE to pr= ovide limited technical support and financial services support to help put = in place cost over-run facility and to help with remaining construction act= ivities and CCC to take our equity (at no cost) and any remaining obligatio= ns.  Aim is to eliminate the potential exposure on ENE's $9 million of guar= antees. =20 =20 Trakya:  During meetings in London, OPIC informed us that they had had good=  meetings with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy.  Government = stated they would ""clean up"" arrears but could not do so before January 200= 2 (presumably there are no budget funds left).  Government committed to wor= k with OPIC on resolving the forex dispute issue but acknowledged that the = legal opinion they had sought and received didn't address the issue properl= y and thus needed additional work to provide the Government with the backin= g it needed to give the issue resolution.

On our question of=  change in frequency in the distribution of dividends OPIC stated they woul= d expeditiously move to review our proposal, indicating no pre-disposed pos= ition against it. =20 =20 Sarlux:  team continues to prepare to submit response to EPC contractor's c= laim, as well as our own counter-claim, all scheduled to be submitted on No= vember 30th.

" FYI!   -----Original Message----- From:  Baker, Lee   Sent: Sunday, November 25, 2001 9:32 PM To: Chandler, Bob Cc: Lin, Judy; Botello, Mary; Apodaca, Vera; Prendergast, Pat; Concklin, Elaine Subject: FW: Activity Rates for 2002  The ETS standard activity types and their corresponding rates were set at the time of the SAP go live, in July 2000.  With the labor true-up process in place it really does not matter what the standard rates are; at month end the standard rate used when someone exception codes, is trued-up to actual.  During the month you can have a variance before the true-up takes place.  From an O&M standpoint ETS does not utilize the real time reporting feature of SAP due to our cost allocation model.  IF Project Systems is being utilized to manage real-time project costs, during the month, a variance will always exist prior to true up.  Routine rate review and maintenance will limit the variance.  My recommendation is that if adjustments are made they should be coordinated at the ETS consolidated level.  At the time of the SAP implementation Allison Milan conducted a study across the different companies and Accounting set the rates with the participation of HR.  Since going live with SAP the integrity of the ETS standard activity types and their corresponding rates and their application to all cost centers has not been maintained because there is not central control point for this process.  Theoretically they should now be off by the merit increase in 2001.  Each year at merit time would be the logical time to make adjustments to the rates.  An option would be to wait until 2002 merit time and make adjustments based on 2001 and 2002 merit results.  It would also be a good time to synchronize all of the ETS ""F"" cost centers with the same rates.  If I can provide any additional help, please let me know.  Thanks.

I have begun the process of copying the existing rates planned for December of 2001 to all periods in 2002.   I am currently thru period 5, 2002 and expect to be complete with period 6, 2002 by late today.  Requested actions:  1.  After we are complete it will be the responsibility of each business unit to go in and confirm data and nofity me of any issues.  I expect to be complete by Wednesday of next week which will give you at least a month to review.  2.  Also, please notify me if there are any additional changes to the primary and secondary contact list for your business unit.  I have made the changes that I have received at this point and the current distribution reflects those changes.    Look for a note from me next week that signals completion of the data copy.  If you would like to begin reviewing data thru period 5 please do so.  Thanks, Paul  Call me with any questions at ext 55013.

Air permits have been delayed from August, 2001 to November, 2001.  The delay of the air permits impacts construction start dates and delays shipment of material.  Major payments of material, equipment and construction have slipped into 2002 because of the air permit delays.   2.)  Our compressor vendor has had a few problems.

We are protesting. However, it has been recommended, and I concur, that we pay the compressor fuel use assessment (""under protest"") to stop interest accruals on the use tax assessment. We believe the sales tax assessment is at best -weak- and therefore do not recommend any payment.  We're requesting approval to cut a check to the Colorado Dept of Revenue for $356,736.95.

Sent: Tuesday, February 12, 2002 10:35 AM To: Hayslett, Rod; Geaccone, Tracy; Chandler, Bob; Saunders, James; Corman, Shelley Cc: Desai, Jayshree Subject: NNG 10 year valuation model  I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -  1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the ""Dynegy transition"" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption.  2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now.  3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the ""contract roll off"" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption  4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more ""reasonable"" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable.  5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.  Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

Cc: Geaccone, Tracy Subject: RE: TW model  Please see comments below:  1) We should probably show TransPecos as an undivided ownership interest as opposed to an investment in JV.  That way, the revenues and costs will be picked up above the line and can be analyzed with the other revenues.  Looks like we are properly picking up the capex from TransPecos in our capex additions already.   I might be missing something, but I only see two accounting ways to handle TransPecos - equity method investment (as shown), or consolidated with 50% minority interests.  In the former case our debt holdings are understated, and in the latter they're overstated.  My guess is that the JV will be accounted for as shown.  In terms of capex, currently I have TW picking up 50% of the capex (starting equity basis).  Not to be flip, but I'm not sure which accounting method would let us pick up half the revenues and half the costs.  If we had an undivided interest we would have 50% of the deal on our books, debt and all.  Please let me know which method I should use.    2) The equity balance did not seem to change for the $137,500,000 equity infusion.     Was this treated as equity in to repay or just an extinguishment?  There was $184mm in excess cash that was dividended back out.  The model had to increase borrowings and pay a dividend to get the debt/equity ratio to 50% after the infusion.   It would seem to me that if there was 137,500,000 coming in that it needed to be paid to reduce the corresponding debt, so where did the excess cash come from?   3) Let's grow Other Taxes by 1%   Should grow by the same percentage as either revenues or net plant.   For most pipes these are property/earnings dependent and are derived from the uitlity operating income line on the form 2 for the most part. I need to fix the model to make ""other taxes"" a function of ppe.  I'll make it a constant rate based on year 1.  Rod reminds me that part of that is probably gross receipts - I'll go back to the  planning models and try to figure out a relative proportion.    Also a part is payroll taxes.    Tracy could probably break it apart for you.  4) Question for TG, Reg Am was only $7.6 million in 2002 but $16.5 million going forward.   All Reg Am should disappear with the new rate case.  that's why we had to increase it so much - so that it amortizes to zero by 2006.  Note that it is non-cash, non-tax, but it represents a large reduction in equity.    Then there must be a problem elsewhere, since it is supposed to be gone by itself.  5) Question for LD/SH on the 2006 drop in revenues by approx. $15 million.  Detail schedules show why, just want to make sure it makes sense. That's an item that Lindy's following up on, but probably the whole group needs to consider.  Our fuel retention goes away after '06, the question is whether ""max rates"" should add in the revenues that we derived from fuel retention or not.  The interpretation in the model is that ""max rates"" means our max published reservation fee only, meaning that we lose $15mm of fuel retention after '06.    If we are at max rates, then that would be the result, however if we are at average rates we would be able to get it back up to the max rate number.  6) ROE questions/cases -   Let's show after ROE, the ROE without the effect of the additional debt that was added in Nov. 2001.  This obviously dropped the ROE from 12-13% to 10%.  If Cooper is successfully in coming out with no debt on TW (it should not have been there in the first place!), the ROE will be much higher.  In addition, reducing equity by the $137,500,000 should also improve the ROE substantially.    ? I'll run a line that adds back tax-adjusted interest expense in the ROE calc, the $137.5mm was handled as above.   This is not intuitive.   The ROE should be bigger with debt, unless the ROE is less than the cost of debt.     Debt up, equity down, ROE up?

"Sorry, I didn't see the questions below.  We were using historical rates (no fuel adjustment because we collect it in fuel sales) through 2006.  After 2006, I calculated an adjustment to add to the historical rates (assuming that we would recapture some of the value of the spread in the rate) and it made the rate greater than the max tariff rate.  Davis and I discussed that we didn't think we should assume anything in the models over max rate, so Davis said he would use the max rate after 2006.  (All of this is just pertaining to the West rates.)  The historical average West rate is $.2565.  The historical West rate with fuel adjustment added is $.3404.  The max rate is $.2868.

Then there must be a problem elsewhere, since it is supposed to be gone by itself.  5) Question for LD/SH on the 2006 drop in revenues by approx. $15 million.  Detail schedules show why, just want to make sure it makes sense. That's an item that Lindy's following up on, but probably the whole group needs to consider.  Our fuel retention goes away after '06, the question is whether ""max rates"" should add in the revenues that we derived from fuel retention or not.  The interpretation in the model is that ""max rates"" means our max published reservation fee only, meaning that we lose $15mm of fuel retention after '06.    If we are at max rates, then that would be the result, however if we are at average rates we would be able to get it back up to the max rate number.  6) ROE questions/cases -   Let's show after ROE, the ROE without the effect of the additional debt that was added in Nov. 2001.  This obviously dropped the ROE from 12-13% to 10%.  If Cooper is successfully in coming out with no debt on TW (it should not have been there in the first place!), the ROE will be much higher.  In addition, reducing equity by the $137,500,000 should also improve the ROE substantially.    ? I'll run a line that adds back tax-adjusted interest expense in the ROE calc, the $137.5mm was handled as above.   This is not intuitive.   The ROE should be bigger with debt, unless the ROE is less than the cost of debt.     Debt up, equity down, ROE up?

We have substanially changed numerous items from the prior red-line and feel this more accurately represents TW's interests. Please review the  document and let me know if you are comfortable with it. In particular, we have softened the language requiring us to demonstrate our financial ability to provide services under the agreement.   At this point, we are just trying to agree on the basics of the K/M LOI so that we can get the transport rate proposal in front of Pemex.
