### üí• Attack Flow:
1. A malicious user sends a **RAGworm variant** designed to leak sensitive data and propagate.
2. The victim innocently requests Gemini to ‚Äúcatch up on my emails‚Äù.
3. Gemini pulls a **malicious email** into its context, triggering the worm.
4. The model becomes **jailbroken**, and the worm activates.
5. Any further interaction‚Äîlike replying to emails‚Äîpropagates the worm to new victims.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This demonstration uses an obvious prompt for clarity. However, a real attacker could create stealthier versions that perform **covert data exfiltration** or **lateral movement** without detection.

### üí° Conclusion

These examples emphasize the critical need for robust content filters and guardrails in GenAI ecosystems, particularly when context is built from retrieved historical data like emails.
