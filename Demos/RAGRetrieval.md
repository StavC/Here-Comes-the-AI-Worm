# Demonstrating RAG Retrieval in Commercial GenAI Systems

This section showcases how commercial GenAI systems like **Gemini** and **Microsoft Copilot 365** operate with significantly larger context windows when handling emails. These systems retrieve numerous prior messages from the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to support user queries, often beyond what is visible to the user.

Gemini‚Äôs behavior is illustrated in the screenshots below.

- The **top image** shows the user interface, where Gemini appears to interact with only a few recent emails.
- Clicking the ‚ÄúRelated sources‚Äù button reveals that Gemini actually retrieves a much **larger set of emails** into the context window.
- The **bottom image** displays the full list of retrieved emails.
